The first line of the `train` file contains the number of samples in the training set (in this case, 5). Each subsequent line specifies a single sample in the format `(input features), (output class)`. The `input features` are separated by spaces and consist of integers representing the values of various features for that sample. For example, in the first sample, the input features are `1, 0, 0, 0, 9`, which means that the sample has an input value of 1 for the first feature, 0 for the second feature, and so on. The `output class` is also specified on each line, using a single integer between 1 and the total number of classes (in this case, 5). For example, the output class for the first sample is `5`.

Similarly, the `test` file contains the test data in the same format as the training data. However, the test data is used only for evaluation purposes during training, and not for actual classification.

Note that the examples provided here are just simple ones to illustrate the basic structure of the files. In practice, the data may be more complex and contain multiple features and classes.
