As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other. The training inputs are `0`s and `4`s, while the test inputs are `9`s and `0`s. Also, the number of inputs in the training examples is 8, while it's 3 in the test examples.

The model seems to be able to learn the patterns in the training data and make accurate predictions on new inputs. However, when given a completely different set of inputs (the test data), the model fails to make any predictions at all. This suggests that the model may not have learned anything generalizable or robust enough to handle new, unseen data.
