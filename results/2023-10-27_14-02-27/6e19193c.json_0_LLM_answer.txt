As you can see, the training and test inputs are all zeroes, but the training output is different from the test output. This means that the neural network has learned something during training, even though there is no data in the training set.

In general, it's a good idea to have some data in the training set, so that the neural network can learn from it. However, if you don't have any data available, you can still use the `train()` function to simulate training on random noise, as shown above. Just keep in mind that this may not give you useful results, and you may need to try other approaches to train your neural network.
