[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one row each time, while maintaining the same column values. Here's how it works:

1. For each input row, shift the entire row by one position to the right.
2. For each output row, start with the first value in the row (which is always 1), and then repeat the process of shifting the remaining values in the row by one position to the right until you reach the last value in the row.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row in the input, and then use the resulting output rows to determine the final output.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

Test input:
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Shift the input by one row to the right:

1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Shift the input by another row to the right:

1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

And so on...

By applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

Test output:
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

So, the final output for the test input is also 1.

Solution:
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
