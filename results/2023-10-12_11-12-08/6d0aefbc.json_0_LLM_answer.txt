LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for getting the output from the input is as follows:

For each row of the input, perform the following operations:

1. If the number in the first position of the row is equal to 1, then multiply the number in the second position by 6 and add it to the number in the third position. Otherwise, do nothing.
2. If the number in the second position of the row is equal to 1, then multiply the number in the third position by 6 and add it to the number in the second position. Otherwise, do nothing.
3. If the number in the third position of the row is equal to 1, then multiply the number in the first position by 6 and add it to the number in the second position. Otherwise, do nothing.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each row of the input.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input: 6, 8, 6; 8, 6, 8; 1, 6, 1

Step 1: Multiply the number in the first position (6) by 6 and add it to the number in the second position (8): 6 x 6 = 36 + 8 = 44.
Step 2: Multiply the number in the second position (8) by 6 and add it to the number in the third position (6): 8 x 6 = 48 + 6 = 54.
Step 3: Multiply the number in the third position (6) by 6 and add it to the number in the first position (1): 6 x 6 = 36 + 1 = 37.

Therefore, the output for the test input is: 44, 54, 37.

Solution:
6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6
8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8
1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1
