LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. We can now use these examples to identify the pattern in the puzzle and solve it. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. Observe that each input consists of a sequence of 8s and other digits (0-7).
2. Notice that each output also consists of a sequence of 8s and other digits, but with some differences in the number of 8s and the order of the digits.
3. Based on these observations, we can infer that the puzzle involves manipulating the digits in the input sequences to produce the corresponding output sequences.
4. To solve the puzzle, we need to find a consistent rule or pattern that maps the input sequences to the output sequences.

Let's try to break down the patterns in the input-output pairs you provided:

Input: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
Output: 1, 4, 7, 4, 1

From this input-output pair, we can observe the following pattern:

* Each input sequence consists of 8 consecutive 8s.
* Each output sequence has a total of 4 8s.
* The remaining digits in the output sequence are distributed among the 4 8s in a specific way: 1 8 appears once, followed by 7 8s, then another 4 8s.

Using this pattern, we can solve the next input-output pair:

Input: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
Output: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4

Again, we see that each input sequence consists of 8 consecutive 8s, and each output sequence has a total of 4 8s. However, the distribution of the remaining digits in the output sequence is different than before: each output sequence contains 4 8s in a row, followed by 4 additional 8s scattered throughout the sequence.

By observing these patterns, we can continue solving the remaining input-output pairs and eventually determine the overall solution to the puzzle.
