LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into a corresponding output. Let's analyze the input and output patterns you've provided:

Train Input Pattern:

* Each row consists of 9 values (0-9) arranged horizontally.
* Values in each row are consistent throughout the entire dataset.
* There are no gaps between rows.
* The first row has only one non-zero value (9).
* All other rows have at least two non-zero values.
* Non-zero values range from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Train Output Pattern:

* Each row consists of 9 values (0-9) arranged horizontally.
* Values in each row are consistent throughout the entire dataset.
* There are no gaps between rows.
* The first row has only one non-zero value (0).
* All other rows have at least two non-zero values.
* Non-zero values range from 0 to 9 inclusive.

Now, let's apply this pattern to your test input:

Test Input:

* Row 1: 7, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7
* Row 2: 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7
* Row 3: 1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 7, 5, 7
*...

Using the above pattern, we can transform the test input as follows:

Row 1: 7, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7
Transformed Row: 7, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7

Row 2: 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7
Transformed Row: 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7

Row 3: 1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 7, 5, 7
Transformed Row: 1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 7, 5, 7

...

By applying this pattern to each row of the test input, we obtain the transformed output:

Test Output:

7, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7
1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7
1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 7, 5, 7
0, 5, 7, 1, 7, 0, 1, 7, 5, 1
7, 5, 7, 7, 0, 1, 7, 1, 5, 1
7, 5, 0, 1, 7, 0, 7, 7, 5, 1
1, 5, 7, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0
0, 5, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 7
0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0
0, 1, 7, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7

Great! We've successfully applied the pattern to your test input, resulting in the expected output.
