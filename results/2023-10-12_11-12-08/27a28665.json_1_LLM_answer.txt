LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is to take the top number in each row, then the middle number, and finally the bottom number. The resulting values are then added together to give the output.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the final test input:

Test input: 7, 7, 0
7, 0, 7
0, 7, 0

Using the pattern, we get:
Top number = 7
Middle number = 7
Bottom number = 0
Total = 7 + 7 + 0 = 14

Therefore, the test output is 14.
