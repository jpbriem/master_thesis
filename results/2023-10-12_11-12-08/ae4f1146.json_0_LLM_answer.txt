LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've been given a series of input-output pairs for a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform an input grid into a desired output grid. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

Step 1 (for each input):

* Start by applying the following transformation to the input grid:
	+ If the input has a value of 0 at position (i, j), replace it with the value of the corresponding element in the output grid (which is provided).
	+ Otherwise, leave the value unchanged.

Step 2 (for each input):

* Repeat Step 1 until no more changes are possible.

The resulting transformed grid will be the output for the given input.

Now, let's apply this process to the test input:

Test input:
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1
1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8
0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8

Applying Steps 1 and 2 to the test input gives us the following output:

Output:
8, 1, 8
1, 1, 8
8, 8, 1

So, the step-by-step pattern to transform the input grid into the desired output grid is:

1. Replace all 0s with the corresponding value from the output grid.
2. Replace all 1s with the next highest value (i.e., 8) in the output grid.
3. Leave all other values unchanged.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
