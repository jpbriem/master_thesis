[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the pattern for each input is to shift the input by one position to the right, and then multiply the corresponding value in the new row by 2.

Here's how this works:

* In the first example, the input is `0, 0`, and the output is `8, 1`. To get the output, we shift the input to the right (i.e., move the cursor one position to the right) and multiply the top value (`0`) by 2, which gives us `8`. We then repeat this process for the second value (`0`), which gives us `1`.
* In the second example, the input is `0, 0, 0`, and the output is `8, 8, 1`. To get the output, we shift each of the three inputs to the right (i.e., move the cursors one position to the right) and multiply the top value in each row by 2. This gives us `8` for the first two outputs, and `1` for the third output.
* In the third example, the input is `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`, and the output is `8, 8, 8, 1`. To get the output, we again shift each of the five inputs to the right and multiply the top value in each row by 2. This gives us `8` for the first three outputs, `8` for the fourth output, and `1` for the fifth output.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`:

Shift the input to the right: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0` becomes `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`
Multiply the top value in each row by 2: `0 × 2 = 0`, `0 × 2 = 0`, `0 × 2 = 0`, `0 × 2 = 0`, `0 × 2 = 0`

Therefore, the output for the test input is `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`.
