LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a set of input samples and their corresponding output labels. I can now use these inputs and labels to train a machine learning model that can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

To do this, I will use a supervised learning algorithm, such as linear regression or logistic regression, to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels. Once the model is trained, you can provide it with new inputs, and it will predict the output based on what it has learned from the training data.

Please provide me with the test input, and I will give you the predicted output.
