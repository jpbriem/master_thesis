LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from each input:

1. Train input:
	* Step 1: Check if the input has a value of 5 in the first row. If it does, move on to step 2. Otherwise, set the output to 2.
	* Step 2: Check if the input has a value of 0 in the second row. If it does, move on to step 3. Otherwise, set the output to 5.
	* Step 3: Check if the input has a value of 0 in the third row. If it does, move on to step 4. Otherwise, set the output to 5.
	* Step 4: Check if the input has a value of 4 in the fourth row. If it does, move on to step 5. Otherwise, set the output to 0.
	* Step 5: Set the output to the maximum value among the values in the last two rows (i.e., the fifth and sixth rows).
2. Train input:
	* Step 1: Check if the input has a value of 5 in the first row. If it does, move on to step 2. Otherwise, set the output to 8.
	* Step 2: Check if the input has a value of 0 in the second row. If it does, move on to step 3. Otherwise, set the output to 5.
	* Step 3: Check if the input has a value of 0 in the third row. If it does, move on to step 4. Otherwise, set the output to 5.
	* Step 4: Check if the input has a value of 4 in the fourth row. If it does, move on to step 5. Otherwise, set the output to 0.
	* Step 5: Set the output to the minimum value among the values in the last three rows (i.e., the fifth, sixth, and seventh rows).
3. Train input:
	* Step 1: Check if the input has a value of 5 in the first row. If it does, move on to step 2. Otherwise, set the output to 4.
	* Step 2: Check if the input has a value of 0 in the second row. If it does, move on to step 3. Otherwise, set the output to 5.
	* Step 3: Check if the input has a value of 0 in the third row. If it does, move on to step 4. Otherwise, set the output to 5.
	* Step 4: Check if the input has a value of 4 in the fourth row. If it does, move on to step 5. Otherwise, set the output to 0.
	* Step 5: Set the output to the maximum value among the values in the last two rows (i.e., the fifth and sixth rows).

Now that you know the steps for each input, you can apply these steps to the test input to get the output. Good luck!
