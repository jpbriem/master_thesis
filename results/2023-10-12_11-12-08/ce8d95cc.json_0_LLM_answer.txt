LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can apply the pattern to the test input:

Step 1: Identify the number of rows (or columns) in each input and output pair. In this case, there are 3 rows in each input and output pair.

Step 2: For each row in the test input, find the number of occurrences of each value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8). You can do this by counting the number of times each value appears in that row.

Step 3: Apply the pattern to the test input by replacing each value in the row with the corresponding value from the output row. For example, if the output row for that row has the value 3, then replace every occurrence of 0 in that row with 3.

Here's an example of how to apply the pattern to the first row of the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0

Output row: 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0

As you can see, we replaced every occurrence of 0 in the test input row with 3, since that's what the output row has at that position. We did the same thing for the other values in the row, replacing 0 with 1, 2 with 2, etc.

Repeat this process for each row in the test input, and you should get the correct output. Good luck!
