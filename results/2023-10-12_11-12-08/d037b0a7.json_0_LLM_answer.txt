LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of input and output is as follows:

For each input, the corresponding output value is obtained by shifting the input value one position to the right (horizontally) and then adding the value of the second column of the input. In other words, if the input is `A`, the output is `A + B`.

Here's how it works for each example:

1. First example:
Input: `0, 0, 6`
Output: `0, 0, 6`
Explanation: Shift the first input value (`0`) to the right and add the second input value (`0`), resulting in `0 + 0 = 0`. Repeat this process for the third input value (`6`), which gives us the output value `0 + 6 = 6`.
2. Second example:
Input: `0, 2, 0`
Output: `7, 2, 8`
Explanation: Shift the first input value (`0`) to the right and add the second input value (`2`), resulting in `0 + 2 = 2`. Repeat this process for the third input value (`0`), which gives us the output value `2 + 0 = 2`. Finally, shift the fourth input value (`8`) to the right and add the second input value (`2`), resulting in `8 + 2 = 10`.
3. Third example:
Input: `4, 0, 0`
Output: `4, 0, 0`
Explanation: Since all three input values are zero, the output value remains unchanged at `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: `4, 0, 8`

Using the same logic as before, we can compute the output value as follows:

Shift the first input value (`4`) to the right and add the second input value (`0`), resulting in `4 + 0 = 4`.
Shift the second input value (`0`) to the right and add the third input value (`8`), resulting in `0 + 8 = 8`.
Finally, shift the third input value (`8`) to the right and add the second input value (`0`), resulting in `8 + 0 = 8`.
Therefore, the output value for the test input is `4 + 8 = 12`.

Solution:
4, 0, 8
4, 0, 8
4, 7, 8
