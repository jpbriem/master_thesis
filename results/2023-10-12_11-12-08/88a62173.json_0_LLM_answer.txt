LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
0, 2, 0, 0, 2
2, 2, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 0, 2, 2
2, 2, 0, 2, 0
train output:
2, 2
2, 0
End of example.
train input:
1, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 1, 0, 0, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 1, 0
1, 1, 0, 0, 1
train output:
1, 0
1, 1
End of example.
train input:
8, 8, 0, 0, 8
8, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 8, 8
8, 0, 0, 8, 0
train output:
0, 8
8, 0
End of example.
test input:
5, 5, 0, 5, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 0, 5, 5
0, 5, 0, 0, 5

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of inputs and outputs is a simple bitwise XOR operation.

Here's how it works:

For each input row, perform a bitwise XOR operation between the corresponding bits (i.e., the least significant bit, the next most significant bit, etc.). The resulting row represents the output.

Here are some examples to illustrate this process:

* For the first input `0, 2, 0, 0, 2`, the XOR operation results in `2, 2`.
* For the second input `2, 2, 0, 2, 2`, the XOR operation results in `2, 0`.
* For the third input `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`, the XOR operation results in `0, 0`.
* For the fourth input `0, 2, 0, 2, 2`, the XOR operation results in `2, 2`.
* For the fifth input `1, 0, 0, 1, 0`, the XOR operation results in `1, 1`.
* For the sixth input `8, 8, 0, 0, 8`, the XOR operation results in `0, 8`.

Now, applying this pattern to the test input `5, 5, 0, 5, 0` gives us the output `[5, 5]`.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
