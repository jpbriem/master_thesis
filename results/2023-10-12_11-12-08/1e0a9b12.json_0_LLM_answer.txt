LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

Example 1:
Input: 0, 4, 0, 9
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0

Explanation: In this case, every input value is multiplied by 2 before being added to the corresponding output position. Therefore, the pattern we can observe is that the output values are twice the input values.

Example 2:
Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Explanation: Similar to the previous example, every input value is multiplied by 2 before being added to the corresponding output position. However, there is no carryover of the 9 from the last input position, so the output remains unchanged.

Example 3:
Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Explanation: This time, none of the input values change, so the output remains the same.

Example 4:
Input: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Explanation: Here, the only non-zero input value is 1, which is added to the first output position. Since the other input values are 0, the remaining output positions remain unchanged.

Example 5:
Input: 0, 0, 0, 1, 2
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Explanation: Similarly, the only non-zero input value is 1, which is added to the first output position. Since the other input values are 0, the remaining output positions remain unchanged.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test Input: 0, 2, 0, 4, 3

Explanation: Using the pattern observed in Example 1, we can see that the output values will be twice the input values. So, the output for this test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
