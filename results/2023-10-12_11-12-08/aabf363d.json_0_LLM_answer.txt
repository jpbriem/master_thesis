LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

For the first example, we have:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The pattern here is that every input value is multiplied by 0, resulting in an output of 0.

For the second example, we have:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The pattern here is that every other input value is multiplied by 3, resulting in an output of 6.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the first pattern, we multiply each input value by 0, resulting in an output of 0:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the second pattern, we multiply every other input value by 3, resulting in an output of 2:

2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is 2.

Solution:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
