LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a set of input values into a corresponding set of output values. Here's how I can help you solve it:

From your description, I understand that the input and output values are represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a 2D grid. The values in each row are non-negative integers, and they do not represent any ordinal ranking.

To start solving the puzzle, I will apply the following steps:

1. Identify the number of rows in both the input and output grids.
2. For each row in the input grid, find the corresponding row in the output grid based on the pattern you provided (i.e., applying the step-by-step pattern).
3. Replace each value in the input row with the corresponding value in the output row.

Once I have applied these steps to the entire input and output grids, I will provide you with the transformed output grid.

Please provide me with the input grid, and I will begin solving the puzzle.
