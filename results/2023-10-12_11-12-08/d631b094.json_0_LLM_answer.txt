[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0
0, 1, 0
train output:
1, 1
End of example.
train input:
0, 2, 0
2, 0, 0
0, 2, 0
train output:
2, 2, 2
End of example.
train input:
0, 7, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
train output:
7
End of example.
train input:
0, 8, 0
8, 8, 0
8, 0, 0
train output:
8, 8, 8, 8
End of example.
test input:
4, 4, 0
4, 0, 4
0, 0, 4

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves taking the middle value of each row and using it to determine the output. Here's how you can apply this pattern to the final test input:

Test input:
4, 4, 0
4, 0, 4
0, 0, 4

Using the middle value of each row (i.e., the second value), we get:

Middle value of first row = 4
Middle value of second row = 0
Middle value of third row = 4

So, the output for the test input is:
[4, 4, 4]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
