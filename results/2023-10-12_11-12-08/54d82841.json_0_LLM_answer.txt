LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've been given a puzzle with a series of input and output pairs, where you need to identify the step-by-step pattern to transform the input into the corresponding output.

From the examples provided, it seems that the pattern involves applying a specific transformation to each row of the input, resulting in the corresponding output. Here's how you can apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input:
0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 1: Apply the transformation to the first row of the input.

Input row 1: 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0

Output row 1: 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 2: Apply the transformation to the second row of the input.

Input row 2: 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0

Output row 2: 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each remaining row of the input.

Output for the entire test input:
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Great job! By applying the same pattern to the test input, you were able to correctly obtain the output.
