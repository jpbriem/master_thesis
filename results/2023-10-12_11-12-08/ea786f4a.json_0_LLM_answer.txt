LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the pattern for each input is to take the number of 1s in the input and use it as an offset to determine the corresponding output value.

For example, in the first input `1, 1, 1`, there are 3 1s, so the output would be `0, 1, 0`. In the second input `2, 2, 2, 2, 2`, there are 5 2s, so the output would be `0, 2, 0, 2, 0`.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input `6, 6, 6, 6, 6,...`:

The number of 1s in the input is 6. Using the offset determined above, we can calculate the output as follows:

Output = Number of 1s + Offset
= 6 + 0
= 6

So, the output for the test input is `6`.

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle.
