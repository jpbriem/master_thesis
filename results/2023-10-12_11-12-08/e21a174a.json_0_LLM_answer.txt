LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a set of input values into their corresponding output values. Here's how I can help you solve it:

From your description, I understand that the input values are represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a different "train input." The output values are also represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a different "train output."

To solve this puzzle, we need to find a pattern that takes each input value and transforms it into the corresponding output value. Since the input and output values are represented as rows of numbers, we can think of this pattern as a sequence of operations that take each input value and modify it according to some rule.

Here's one possible approach to solving this puzzle:

1. Start by analyzing the first input value in each row. Look for patterns in the way the input values change across rows. For example, do the values in each row increase or decrease by a constant amount? Are there any repeating patterns?
2. Once you've identified a pattern in the input values, try applying it to the corresponding output value. See if the resulting value matches the expected output value. If it doesn't match, try adjusting the pattern until it does.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row in the input matrix. As you work through each row, look for ways to generalize the pattern you've found so far. Can you come up with a simple formula or algorithm that could be applied to any input value?
4. Finally, use the pattern you've developed to solve the test input. Apply the formula or algorithm to each input value and see if the resulting output value matches the expected output value.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the pattern that transforms the input values into their corresponding output values. Good luck!
