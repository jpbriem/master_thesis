[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these types of puzzles involves manipulating the values in each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output value. Here's how the pattern works:

1. Start by comparing the number of values in each row of the input grid to the number of output values. In the examples provided, there are always 3 output values.
2. If the number of values in each row of the input grid is less than or equal to 3, then the output values will be 0. Otherwise, the output values will be non-zero.
3. Compare the values in each row of the input grid to determine which ones should have their values increased or decreased by 1. This is done based on the relative positions of the values in each row. For example, if two values in the same row are adjacent to each other, then one of them will increase by 1 and the other will decrease by 1.
4. Apply the above steps to each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output values.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input:
4, 4, 4
2, 3, 2
3, 2, 3

Step 1: Compare the number of values in each row of the input grid to the number of output values (which is 3). Since the number of values in each row is greater than 3, the output values will be non-zero.

Step 2: Determine which values in each row should increase or decrease by 1 based on their relative positions. For example, in the first row, the value at position 2 increases by 1 and the value at position 3 decreases by 1. In the second row, the value at position 2 increases by 1 and the value at position 3 decreases by 1. In the third row, the value at position 2 increases by 1 and the value at position 3 decreases by 1.

Step 3: Apply the above steps to each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output values.

Output for test input:
5, 0, 0
0, 5, 0
0, 0, 5

I hope this helps you solve more puzzles like this! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
