LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems that the pattern for each input is to take the number of 3s in the input and use it as the number of times to multiply the corresponding value in the output by 3. For example, in the first input, there are 3 3s, so the output would be 3 x 3 = 9.

Using this pattern, we can apply it to the test input:

Test input: 0, 2, 2, 2, 2

We have 3 3s in the input, so the output would be:

Output: 3 x 3 = 9

Therefore, the test output is 9.

Solution:
0, 3, 3, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 3, 3
3, 3, 0, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 0, 3
