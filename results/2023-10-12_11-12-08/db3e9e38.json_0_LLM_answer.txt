LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and figure out the pattern for getting the output from the input.

From the first two examples, we can see that the pattern is to add 1 to each element in the input row by row, and then repeat this process for each subsequent row. So, if we apply this pattern to the test input, we should get the following output:

Test output:
[8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 0]

Great! Now let's move on to the next example. Can you please provide the next set of input and output pairs?

Solution:
8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8
8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8
0, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8
0, 0, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8
0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
