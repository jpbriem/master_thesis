[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the pattern involves manipulating the values in each row based on a specific rule. Here's what we can observe from the examples:

1. When a value in a row is increased by 1, the corresponding value in the next row is decreased by 1. For example, in the first input, when the value in the first row is increased by 1 (from 0 to 1), the value in the second row is decreased by 1 (from 2 to 1).
2. When a value in a row is doubled, the corresponding value in the next row is also doubled. For example, in the second input, when the value in the first row is doubled (from 0 to 0), the value in the second row is also doubled (from 0 to 0).
3. When a value in a row is multiplied by 2, the corresponding value in the next row is also multiplied by 2. For example, in the third input, when the value in the first row is multiplied by 2 (from 0 to 0), the value in the second row is also multiplied by 2 (from 0 to 0).

Based on these observations, we can make an educated guess about the step-by-step pattern involved in solving the puzzle. Here's how we can apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6

Step 1: Increase the value in the first row by 1, so the new value becomes 1.
Step 2: Double the value in the second row, so the new value becomes 0.
Step 3: Multiply the value in the third row by 2, so the new value becomes 12.
Step 4: Decrease the value in the fourth row by 1, so the new value becomes 5.
Step 5: Increase the value in the fifth row by 1, so the new value becomes 6.
Step 6: Double the value in the sixth row, so the new value becomes 0.
Step 7: Multiply the value in the seventh row by 2, so the new value becomes 0.
Step 8: Decrease the value in the eighth row by 1, so the new value becomes 5.
Step 9: Increase the value in the ninth row by 1, so the new value becomes 6.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

6, 0, 12, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6

It's important to note that this is just one possible solution to the puzzle, and there may be other valid solutions as well. Can you verify whether this solution is correct?
