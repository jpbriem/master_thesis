LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into an output. Let's analyze the training examples you provided:

In each training example, we have an input matrix and an output matrix. The input matrix consists of zeros and ones, where the ones represent the value of the corresponding cell in the output matrix. For instance, in the first training example, the input matrix is:
```markdown
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
And the output matrix is:
```markdown
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
The pattern we need to identify is how to transform the input matrix into the output matrix. To do this, we can use a simple algorithm that iteratively applies the following operation to each cell in the input matrix:

If the cell has a value of 0, leave it unchanged.
If the cell has a value of 1, set its value to the corresponding cell in the output matrix.

By applying this operation repeatedly to each cell in the input matrix, we can transform it into the output matrix.

Now, let's apply this algorithm to the test input you provided:
```markdown
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
We will iterate through each cell in the input matrix and apply the operation described above. Here's what we get:
```markdown
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
As expected, we got the same output as the corresponding cell in the output matrix. Therefore, the pattern we identified earlier works for this test input as well.

Let's now apply this pattern to other test inputs to see if they produce the correct output.
