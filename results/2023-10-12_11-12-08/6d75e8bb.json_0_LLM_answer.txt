LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to find a pattern in the input data that will produce a specific output for each input.

To start, let's analyze the first few examples in the training set:

* Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

From this example, we can see that the pattern is simply to copy the input value unchanged. So, if we have an input of 4, the output would be 4.

Let's try applying this pattern to the test input:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the pattern we just identified, the output for this input should be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Great! We've successfully solved the first example using the pattern we found. Let's move on to the next one:

Training input:
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0

Training output:
0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0

Can you figure out the pattern here?

0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0
