LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

From the first example:

* Input: 3, 3, 8
* Output: 0, 0, 5

The pattern we observe is that when the number of elements in the input row is even (e.g., 3), the corresponding element in the output row is always zero. When the number of elements in the input row is odd (e.g., 3), the corresponding element in the output row is equal to the sum of the elements in the input row divided by 2 (e.g., 5).

Now let's apply this pattern to the second example:

* Input: 5, 5, 2
* Output: 0, 0, 0

In this case, since the number of elements in the input row is even (5), all elements in the output row are zero.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the pattern in the output for each input is determined by the parity of the number of elements in the input row. If the number of elements is even, then all elements in the output row are zero; otherwise, the corresponding element in the output row is equal to the sum of the elements in the input row divided by 2.

Now, let's use this pattern to solve the test input:

* Test input: 6, 3, 5
* Test output:?

Applying the pattern, we have:

* Number of elements in input row = 6 (even)
* Sum of elements in input row / 2 = 3 + 5 = 8 (odd)

Therefore, the test output is 8.

So, the final answer for the test input is:

Test output: 8
