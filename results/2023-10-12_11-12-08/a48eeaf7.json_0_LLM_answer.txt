[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to determine the step-by-step pattern to transform each row of input values into the corresponding output value.

To start, let's analyze the first two rows of both the input and output datasets:

Input Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

From these initial rows, we can see that the pattern appears to be simply adding a fixed value (in this case, 0) to each element in the input row. Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for transforming an input row into the corresponding output row would be:

Step 1: Add 0 to every element in the input row.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the remaining input rows and observe how the output changes. For example, when applying the pattern to the second input row:

Input Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5

We get the following output:

Output Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

As expected, the output remains unchanged since no modifications were made to the input elements.

Now, let's apply the same pattern to the test input:

Test Input Row 1: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the step-by-step pattern we derived earlier, we can transform the input row as follows:

Step 1: Add 0 to every element in the input row, resulting in:
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 2: Add 0 to every element in the resultant row, resulting in:
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Repeating this process for each input row gives us the following output:

Test Output Row 1: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

By repeating this process for each input row, we can generate the entire test output dataset.

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern to transform the input values into the corresponding output values is:

Step 1: Add 0 to every element in the input row.

This pattern can be applied to each input row separately, resulting in the corresponding output row.
