LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems like the pattern for each input is to shift the values one position to the right, then repeat the process until no more shifting is possible. So, if the input is `8, 8, 6`, the output would be `8, 8, 8, 8`.

Here's how you can apply this pattern to the final test input:

Test input: `8, 8, 6`

Step 1: Shift the first value to the right by one position, so the new input is `8, 7, 6`.
Step 2: Shift the second value to the right by one position, so the new input is `6, 7, 6`.
Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more shifting is possible (in this case, there are no more positions to shift).

So, the output for the test input `8, 8, 6` is `8, 8, 8, 8`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Solution:
8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6
6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6
6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8
6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8
6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6
8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6
8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6
6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6
6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8
