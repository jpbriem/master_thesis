LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems like the pattern for each pair of inputs and outputs is:

Inputs: A sequence of integers (0-9) arranged horizontally.
Outputs: A sequence of integers (0-9) arranged horizontally, where each element in the output sequence is equal to the corresponding element in the input sequence plus a fixed value.

For example, in the first example, the input is `5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`, and the output is `3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9`. In this case, the fixed value is `+3`.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5`

Using the same pattern as before, we get the following output:

Test output: `7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 14, 14, 14`

So, the test output is `7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 14, 14, 14`.

Solution:
1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6
1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6
1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6
