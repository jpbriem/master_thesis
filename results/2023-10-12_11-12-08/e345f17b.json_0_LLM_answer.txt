[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of input and output is as follows:

1. Each row of the input represents a different number of "blocks" (represented by the values 0-6).
2. Each block can either be completely filled (represented by a value of 6) or partially filled (represented by a value of 0).
3. The position of a block within a row determines whether it is included in the corresponding output block. If a block is completely filled, it will be included in the output if it is located at the top left corner of the row. Otherwise, it will be included in the output if it is located at the bottom right corner of the row.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input:
6, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5

We start by identifying the number of blocks in each row of the input:

Row 1: 3 blocks (completely filled)
Row 2: 2 blocks (partially filled)
Row 3: 3 blocks (completely filled)
Row 4: 2 blocks (partially filled)

Next, we determine which blocks are included in the output based on their position within each row:

Row 1: Blocks at the top left corner are included in the output. Since there are 3 completely filled blocks in this row, we include 3 blocks in the output.
Row 2: Blocks at the bottom right corner are included in the output. Since there are 2 partially filled blocks in this row, we include 2 blocks in the output.
Row 3: All 3 blocks are included in the output since they are completely filled and located at the top left corner of the row.
Row 4: Only the block at the bottom right corner is included in the output since it is partially filled.

Therefore, the output for the test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4

Solution:
0, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 4
