LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for transforming the input into the output involves shifting the input by one position to the right, and then replacing each value in the shifted input with the corresponding value in the original input. Here's how it works:

1. Shift the input by one position to the right:

For example, given the input `0, 7, 0`, we shift it to the right to get `0, 7, 7`.

2. Replace each value in the shifted input with the corresponding value in the original input:

For example, in the shifted input `0, 7, 7`, we replace the first value (0) with the original input value (0), the second value (7) with the original input value (7), and so on.

So, applying this pattern to the test input `7, 7, 0` gives us the output `[7, 7, 7]`.

Here's a summary of the steps involved in solving this puzzle:

1. Shift the input by one position to the right.
2. Replace each value in the shifted input with the corresponding value in the original input.

I hope this helps you solve more puzzles! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
