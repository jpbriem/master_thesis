LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've been given a series of input-output pairs for a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform an input grid into a corresponding output grid. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

Step 1: Identify the basic operation
The first thing you need to do is to identify the basic operation that is being applied to the input grids to produce the output grids. In this case, it seems like the operation is simply copying a value from one position to another position in the grid.

Step 2: Determine the rule for applying the operation
Once you have identified the basic operation, you need to determine the rule for applying it to the input grids. In this case, the rule appears to be that if a cell has a value of 5 in the input grid, then it will become a 6 in the output grid. If a cell has a value of 0 in the input grid, then it will remain 0 in the output grid.

Step 3: Apply the operation to the test input
Now that you know the basic operation and the rule for applying it, you can use these steps to apply the operation to the test input. Simply follow the rules for each cell in the input grid to produce the corresponding output cell.

Here are the results of applying the operation to the test input:

test output:
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6

Great job! By following these steps, you were able to solve the puzzle and determine the step-by-step pattern for transforming an input grid into an output grid.
