LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. I will now use the patterns observed in the training examples to solve the test input. Here is the result:

Test input: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Output: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Explanation:

The pattern we observed in the training examples is that each row has a value of 8 repeated 8 times. Since the test input also consists of 8s, we can simply repeat the value 8 8 times to obtain the output.
