[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the examples provided, it seems that the puzzle involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform an input grid into another grid. The pattern consists of a sequence of operations that are applied to each row of the input grid, resulting in a transformed output grid.

Here's how I interpret the examples:

1. The first example has a simple transformation: each row is shifted by one position to the right. Therefore, the output grid is obtained by shifting each row of the input grid by one position to the right.
2. In the second example, there are two types of transformations:
	* Each row is either rotated by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the value in the middle column of the row.
	* If a row has a value of 6 in the middle column, then the row is flipped horizontally.
3. In the third example, there are three types of transformations:
	* Each row is either rotated by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the value in the middle column of the row.
	* If a row has a value of 0 in the middle column, then the row is flipped vertically.
	* If a row has a value of 2 in the middle column, then the row is flipped both vertically and horizontally.

Based on these patterns, I can now apply them to the test input:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8

Applying the patterns to the test input gives us the following output:

Test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8

As you can see, the test input is transformed into the same output as the training examples.
