LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle.

The pattern you need to identify is:

For each input row, if the number in the first position (i.e., the top left corner) is equal to 3, then the output for that row will be 2. Otherwise, the output for that row will be 0.

Here's how this works:

* If the first value in an input row is 3, then the output for that row will be 2. This is because the first value in the output row is always 2.
* If the first value in an input row is not 3, then the output for that row will be 0.

So, to summarize:

* If the first value in an input row is 3, then the output will be 2.
* If the first value in an input row is not 3, then the output will be 0.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the final test input:

Test input:
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the pattern we just identified, we can see that the output for this input should be:

Output: 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

As expected, the second value in the input (which is 0) matches the output value of 2, so the output for this input is 2. The remaining values in the input are all 0, which match the corresponding output values.

Great job solving the puzzle!
