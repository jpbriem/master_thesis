LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems that the pattern for each input is to shift the values one position to the right, and then add the value at the top left corner (which is always 0) to the resulting row.

Here's how you can apply this pattern to the final test input:

Test input: `9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0`

Step 1: Shift the values to the right: `9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 9`

Step 2: Add the value at the top left corner (which is always 0): `0 + 0 = 0`

Therefore, the output for the test input is `0`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Solution:
0, 0, 8
8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8
0, 0, 0
8, 0, 0
