LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. I will now use the same steps to solve the test input you provided:

Step 1: Identify the pattern in the input
The pattern in the input is that each row consists of a sequence of 0s and 1s, where each 0 represents a blank space and each 1 represents an element in the grid. The elements are arranged in a specific order, which we can see by looking at the first few rows of the input:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
...
```
Step 2: Apply the pattern to the test input
We can apply the same pattern to the test input by replacing each 0 with a blank space and each 1 with an element in the grid. Here's how the test input would look like after applying the pattern:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
...
```
Step 3: Get the output
By following the same rules as before, we can determine the output for the test input. Here it is:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
...
```
Congratulations! You have successfully solved the puzzle using the steps outlined above.
