LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of inputs and outputs is as follows:

For each input, if the number in the first column is even, then the corresponding output value will be twice the input value in the second column. If the number in the first column is odd, then the corresponding output value will be zero.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input: 3, 0, 0

According to the pattern, if the number in the first column (3) is even, then the corresponding output value will be twice the input value in the second column (0), which is 0. So, the test output for this input should be [0, 0, 0].

Am I correct?

Solution:
0, 1, 1
0, 0, 0
1, 1, 0
