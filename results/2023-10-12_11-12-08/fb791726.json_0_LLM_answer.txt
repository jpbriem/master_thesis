[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve this puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to find a step-by-step pattern to transform each row of input values into the corresponding output value. Since the input and output values are represented as rows of numbers, we can assume that each row corresponds to a single "step" in the transformation process.

To start, let's analyze the first two examples provided in the training data:

1. Input: `0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0`
Output: `0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0`

From these examples, we can observe that the transformation process involves adding a fixed value (in this case, `4`) to each element in the input row. Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for this example would be:

Step 1: Add `4` to the first element in the input row.
Step 2: Add `4` to the second element in the input row.
...
Step 6: Add `4` to the sixth element in the input row.

Using this pattern, we can transform the input `9, 0, 0, 0` into the output `9, 0, 0, 0`. Here's how:

Step 1: Add `4` to the first element in the input row (`9`).
Step 2: Add `4` to the second element in the input row (`0`).
...
Step 6: Add `4` to the sixth element in the input row (`0`).

Now, let's move on to the next example:

Input: `0, 8, 0`
Output: `0, 8, 0`

In this case, the transformation process involves multiplying each element in the input row by a constant factor (in this case, `2`). Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for this example would be:

Step 1: Multiply the first element in the input row by `2`.
Step 2: Multiply the second element in the input row by `2`.
...
Step 3: Multiply the third element in the input row by `2`.

Using this pattern, we can transform the input `9, 0, 0, 0` into the output `9, 0, 0, 0`. Here's how:

Step 1: Multiply the first element in the input row (`9`) by `2`.
Step 2: Multiply the second element in the input row (`0`) by `2`.
...
Step 3: Multiply the third element in the input row (`0`) by `2`.

Finally, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: `9, 0, 0, 0`

Using the step-by-step pattern we just derived, we can transform the input `9, 0, 0, 0` into the output `9, 0, 0, 0`:

Step 1: Add `4` to the first element in the input row (`9`).
Step 2: Add `4` to the second element in the input row (`0`).
...
Step 6: Add `4` to the sixth element in the input row (`0`).

Therefore, the output for the test input is also `9, 0, 0, 0`.

Solution:
9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
