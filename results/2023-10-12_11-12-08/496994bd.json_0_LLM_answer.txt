LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down the pattern in the examples you provided:

1. In both examples, the input consists of multiple rows of numbers, where each row represents a 2D grid with values from 0-9.
2. The output for each input row is always the same length as the input row.
3. The values in each output row are never the same as the values in the corresponding input row.
4. The pattern seems to be that the output value for each input position is determined by adding a fixed number (which appears to be 2) to the corresponding input value. For example, in the first example, the output value for the first input position is 2 + 2 = 4, and so on.

Based on these observations, we can create a simple algorithm to solve the puzzle:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the output values.
2. For each input row:
a. Add the input value at each position to the output list.
b. Repeat step a for each position in the input row.
3. Return the output list.

Using this algorithm, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3

Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store the output values.

List: []

Step 2: For each input row:

Row 1: 3 + 3 = 6
Row 2: 5 + 5 = 10
Row 3: 5 + 5 = 10
Row 4: 0 + 0 = 0
Row 5: 0 + 0 = 0
Row 6: 0 + 0 = 0
Row 7: 0 + 0 = 0
Row 8: 0 + 0 = 0

Step 3: Return the output list.

List: [6, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is [6, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0].
