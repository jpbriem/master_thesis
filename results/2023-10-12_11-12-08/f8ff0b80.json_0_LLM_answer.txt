[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the patterns you observed in the training examples, your goal is to determine the step-by-step process for converting each row of input into an output.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Start by applying the first rule (always add 1 to the current value) to the first row of input. This will give you the output value for that row.
2. Now, apply the second rule (if the current value is even, subtract 1 from it). Use this modified value as the new input for the next rule application.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you have applied all the rules to the entire input row. The resulting output value is the final answer for that row.
4. Move on to the next row of input and repeat the process.

Using this approach, you should be able to apply the rules to the test input and obtain the correct output values. Good luck!
