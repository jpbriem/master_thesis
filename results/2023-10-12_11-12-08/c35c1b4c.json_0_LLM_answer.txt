LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into a corresponding output. Let's analyze the input and output patterns you've provided:

Train Input Pattern:

* Each row consists of 2-3 digits (0-9)
* The first digit in each row is always 0 or 1
* The remaining digits in each row follow a repeating pattern: 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0

Train Output Pattern:

* Each row consists of 2-3 digits (0-9)
* All the digits in each row are equal to 0 or 1

Based on these patterns, we can observe that the transformation from input to output involves replacing each digit in the input with a corresponding digit in a predefined cycle (i.e., 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0). To apply this pattern to the test input, we need to iterate through each digit in the input and replace it with the corresponding digit in the cycle. Here's how we can do it:

Test Input:

0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0

Step-by-Step Transformation:

1. Replace the first digit (0) with the first digit in the cycle (6). So, the transformed value becomes 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0.
2. Replace the second digit (0) with the second digit in the cycle (6). So, the transformed value becomes 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for the remaining digits in the input.

The resulting transformed value is the test output.

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern to transform the test input is:

Replace the first digit with the first digit in the cycle (6), then replace the second digit with the second digit in the cycle (6), and so on until all the digits have been replaced.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle!
