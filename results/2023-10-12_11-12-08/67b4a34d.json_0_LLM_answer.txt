LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have provided me with a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle, and I'm happy to help you solve it. Here are the steps I will follow:

1. Identify the pattern in the input-output pairs:

The pattern in this puzzle appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each number in the input represents a letter of the alphabet, and each output represents the same letter shifted by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, the input "9, 9, 1, 9" corresponds to the output "B, B, A, B".

2. Apply the pattern to the test input:

Using the identified pattern, we can apply it to the test input "9, 9, 2, 9". The letters corresponding to each number in the input are:

* 9 = S
* 9 = T
* 2 = B
* 9 = K

So, the output for the test input is "STK".

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Let me know if you need further assistance.
