LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each input is to simply repeat the input value a certain number of times. For example, in the first example, the input "2, 1, 4" is repeated twice to give the output "2, 1, 4". In the second example, the input "3, 2, 1, 4" is repeated three times to give the output "3, 2, 1, 4". And so on.

So, applying this pattern to the test input "1, 2, 3, 4, 8", we get the following output:

"1, 2, 3, 4, 8" repeated 5 times gives us the output "1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8".

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
