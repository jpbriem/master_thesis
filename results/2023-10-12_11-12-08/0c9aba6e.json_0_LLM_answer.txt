LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems that the pattern for each input is to shift the values in the input by one position to the right, and then multiply the resulting values by a fixed factor (either 2 or 6).

Here's how you can apply this pattern to the test input:

1. Shift the first value in the input (0, 0, 0, 2) to the right by one position:
0, 0, 0, 3
2. Multiply the second value in the input (2, 2, 2, 0) by a factor of 2:
4, 4, 4, 0
3. Shift the third value in the input (0, 0, 0, 2) to the right by one position:
0, 0, 0, 3
4. Multiply the fourth value in the input (2, 0, 0, 2) by a factor of 6:
12, 0, 0, 0
5. Shift the fifth value in the input (0, 2, 2, 0) to the right by one position:
0, 2, 2, 1
6. Multiply the sixth value in the input (2, 0, 0, 2) by a factor of 2:
4, 0, 0, 0
7. Shift the seventh value in the input (0, 0, 0, 2) to the right by one position:
0, 0, 0, 3
8. Multiply the eighth value in the input (6, 6, 6, 0) by a factor of 6:
36, 0, 0, 0

The resulting output for the test input is:
[8, 0, 0, 8]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
