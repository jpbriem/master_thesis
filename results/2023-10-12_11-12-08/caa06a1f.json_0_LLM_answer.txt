LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. I will now use the patterns you've identified to solve the test input. Here is the result:

Test input:
8, 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3

Output:
3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6

As you can see, the output for the test input is also a row of numbers, representing a 2D grid. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
