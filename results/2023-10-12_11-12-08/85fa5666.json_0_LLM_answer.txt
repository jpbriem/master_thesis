LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have provided me with a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. I will now use the patterns observed in the training examples to solve the test input.

For the test input:
```
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
I will apply the following steps to solve this puzzle:

1. Identify the step-by-step pattern in the training examples:
	* For each row, find the number of times each value appears (either 0 or 1).
	* Use these counts to create a binary matrix where each cell represents the probability of a particular value appearing in that position.
	* Apply a nonlinear transformation (such as logarithm or square root) to the binary matrix to normalize the probabilities.
2. Use the trained model to predict the output for the test input:
	* Feed the test input into the trained model, applying the same nonlinear transformation used in step 1.
	* Sum up the predicted probabilities across all positions to obtain the final output.

Based on these steps, the solution for the test input is:
```
Output: 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
Please let me know if you would like me to explain the reasoning behind this solution or if you have any questions!
