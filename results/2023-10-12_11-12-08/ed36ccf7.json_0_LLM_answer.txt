LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
9, 0, 0
9, 9, 9
9, 9, 9
train output:
0, 9, 9
0, 9, 9
9, 9, 9
End of example.
train input:
6, 6, 6
0, 0, 0
6, 6, 0
train output:
6, 0, 0
6, 0, 6
6, 0, 6
End of example.
train input:
0, 0, 9
0, 0, 9
9, 9, 9
train output:
9, 9, 9
0, 0, 9
0, 0, 9
End of example.
train input:
2, 0, 2
0, 0, 2
0, 2, 2
train output:
2, 2, 2
0, 0, 2
2, 0, 0
End of example.
test input:
0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0
0, 5, 5

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each input is to shift the values in the row by one position to the right. So, if the input is `row1 = [a1, a2,..., an]`, then the output will be `row2 = [a1 + 1, a2 + 1,..., an + 1]`.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:
```
test input:
0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0
0, 5, 5

output:
0, 5, 5
5, 5, 0
0, 5, 5
```
So, the test output is `[0, 5, 5, 5]`.

Solution:
0, 0, 5
0, 0, 5
0, 5, 0
