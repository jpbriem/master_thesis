LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the pattern for getting the output from the input consists of the following steps:

1. If the input has an odd number of rows (i.e., the number of rows is not divisible by 2), then the output will have an even number of rows.
2. If the input has an even number of rows, then the output will have an odd number of rows.
3. For each row in the input, if the value in the first position is equal to 0, then the corresponding value in the output will be 0. Otherwise, the corresponding value in the output will be the same as the value in the input.

Using these rules, let's apply the pattern to the test input:

Test input: 3, 0, 0, 1

Step 1: Check if the input has an odd number of rows. In this case, the input has 4 rows, which is divisible by 2, so the output will also have an even number of rows.

Step 2: Apply the rule for each row in the input. Since the first value in each row is 0, the corresponding values in the output will be 0.

Therefore, the test output for the test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle using the pattern you identified.
