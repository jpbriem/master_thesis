LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

Example 1:
Input: 7, 5, 7
Output: 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 5

Pattern observed: Each input value is multiplied by 2 before being added to the previous output value.

Example 2:
Input: 7, 7, 8
Output: 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 8

Pattern observed: Each input value is increased by 1 before being used to compute the next output value.

Example 3:
Input: 8, 8, 8
Output: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Pattern observed: All input values are used unchanged to compute the next output value.

Example 4:
Input: 8, 7, 5
Output: 7, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 5, 5, 5, 7, 8

Pattern observed: Each input value is subtracted by 1 before being used to compute the next output value.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: 8, 5, 7

Using the same pattern as above, we can compute the output as follows:

8 Ã— 2 = 16 (add 7)
16 + 5 = 21 (add 7)
21 + 7 = 28 (add 5)

Therefore, the test output is 28.

Solution:
7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7
5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5
5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5
