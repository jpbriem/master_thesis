LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these puzzles involves the following steps:

1. Count the number of 9s in each row.
2. If there are an odd number of 9s, add 6 to the count. Otherwise, leave the count unchanged.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row.
4. Sum up the counts for all rows to get the final output.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

Test input:
9, 9, 0, 9, 0
0, 0, 9, 0, 9
0, 0, 0, 9, 9
4, 4, 4, 0, 4
4, 0, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 0, 0, 0

Step 1: Count the number of 9s in each row:
Row 1: 2 (9 + 9)
Row 2: 2 (9 + 0)
Row 3: 1 (0 + 9)
Row 4: 2 (4 + 4)

Step 2: Add 6 if there are an odd number of 9s:
Row 1: 8 (2 + 6)
Row 2: 8 (2 + 6)
Row 3: 7 (1 + 6)
Row 4: 10 (2 + 6)

Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row.

Row 1: 8
Row 2: 8
Row 3: 7
Row 4: 10

Step 4: Sum up the counts for all rows:
8 + 8 + 7 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the output for the test input is 41.
