[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these types of puzzles involves manipulating the values in each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output value. Here's how the pattern works:

1. Start by comparing the number of 0s in each row of the input grid. If there are an odd number of 0s, move the leftmost non-zero value to the right by one position. If there are an even number of 0s, move the leftmost non-zero value to the right by two positions.
2. After moving the leftmost non-zero value, compare the number of 0s in each row again. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more moves possible.
3. The resulting arrangement of non-zero values in each row will determine the output value.

Using this pattern, let's solve the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 0
2, 0, 0
2, 0, 0

Step 1: Compare the number of 0s in each row. There are an odd number of 0s in the first row (2), so we move the leftmost non-zero value (0) to the right by one position.

Input after step 1: 0, 0, 2
2, 0, 0
2, 0, 0

Step 2: Compare the number of 0s in each row again. There are still an odd number of 0s in the first row, so we move the leftmost non-zero value (0) to the right by one position.

Input after step 2: 0, 0, 3
2, 0, 0
2, 0, 0

Repeating this process until there are no more moves possible gives us the following output:

Output: 4

So, the test output for the given test input is 4.
