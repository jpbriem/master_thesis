LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. I will now use the same steps to solve the puzzle using the test input you provided. Here are my steps and calculations:

Step 1: Identify the pattern in the input data
The input data consists of a sequence of numbers, where each number represents a digit in the grid. To identify the pattern, we need to look at the way the digits are arranged in the input data. We can see that the digits are arranged in a specific order, with the first digit being 0, followed by 1, 2, 3, and so on. This suggests that the pattern may involve shifting the digits by one position to the right.

Step 2: Apply the pattern to the test input
Using the pattern identified in Step 1, we can apply it to the test input. We start by shifting the digits in the test input to the right by one position, and then repeating the process until we reach the end of the input. Here's how the test input looks after applying the pattern:

0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 3: Determine the output
After applying the pattern to the test input, we can determine the output by looking at the last row of the transformed input. In this case, the last row is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
