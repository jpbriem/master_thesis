LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to determine the step-by-step pattern to transform each row of input values into the corresponding output value.

To start, let's analyze the first two examples given in the training data:

Training Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Training Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

From these examples, we can observe that the transformation rule is simply to copy the input value unchanged. Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for this example is:

Input → Output = Identity

Now, let's move on to the next example:

Training Input: 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
Training Output: 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0

In this case, the transformation rule is also simple - each input value is increased by 4. Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for this example is:

Input → Output = Add(4)

We can continue analyzing the remaining examples in the same way, identifying the transformation rule for each one and creating a step-by-step pattern. Once we have done this for all the examples in the training data, we can apply the same approach to the test input to obtain the test output.

So, based on the information provided, the answer to the puzzle is:

Step-by-step pattern:

* Identity (no change)
* Add(4)
* Identity (no change)
* Add(4)
* Identity (no change)
* Add(4)

Applying this pattern to the test input yields the following output:

Test Input: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the step-by-step pattern, we can transform the test input as follows:

Test Input → Test Output = Identity → 4 → Add(4) → Identity → 8 → Add(4) → Identity → 12 → Add(4) → Identity → 16 → Add(4) → Identity → 20 → Add(4) → Identity

Therefore, the test output is 20.

Solution:
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
