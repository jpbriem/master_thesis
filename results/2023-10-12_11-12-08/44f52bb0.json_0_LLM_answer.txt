[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these types of puzzles involves manipulating the values in each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output value. Here's how the pattern works:

1. Start by comparing the number of 2s in each row of the input grid. If there are an odd number of 2s, move the leftmost 2 to the right by one position. If there are an even number of 2s, move the leftmost 2 to the right by two positions.
2. Compare the number of 0s in each row of the input grid. If there are an odd number of 0s, move the topmost 0 to the bottom by one position. If there are an even number of 0s, move the topmost 0 to the bottom by two positions.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more moves can be made.
4. The resulting configuration of 2s and 0s in the input grid will correspond to a unique output value.

Using this pattern, let's solve the test input:

Test input:
2, 0, 2
2, 2, 2
2, 0, 2

Step 1: Compare the number of 2s in each row. There are an odd number of 2s, so we move the leftmost 2 to the right by one position.

Input after step 1:
2, 0, 2
2, 2, 2
2, 0, 2

Step 2: Compare the number of 0s in each row. There are an even number of 0s, so we move the topmost 0 to the bottom by two positions.

Input after step 2:
2, 0, 2
2, 2, 0
2, 0, 2

Repeating steps 1 and 2 until no more moves can be made results in the following configuration:

Input after repeated steps:
2, 0, 2
2, 2, 0
2, 0, 2

The corresponding output value is 5.

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for solving these types of puzzles is:

1. Compare the number of 2s in each row and move the leftmost 2 to the right if there are an odd number of 2s, or move it to the right by two positions if there are an even number of 2s.
2. Compare the number of 0s in each row and move the topmost 0 to the bottom by two positions if there are an even number of 0s, or move it to the bottom by one position if there are an odd number of 0s.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more moves can be made.

I hope this helps you solve similar puzzles in the future!
