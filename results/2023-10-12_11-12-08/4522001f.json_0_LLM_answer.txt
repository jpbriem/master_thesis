[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I understand that the goal is to identify a step-by-step pattern to transform the input into the corresponding output. The pattern seems to involve repeatedly applying a simple operation to the input, which is either adding 1 to the value in each position (as seen in the first two examples) or replacing the value in each position with the value in the same position of the previous row (as seen in the last three examples).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by analyzing the individual elements of the input:

* `0, 3, 3`: The first element is 0, and the second and third elements are both 3.
* `0, 2, 3`: The first element is 0, and the second element is 2, while the third element is still 3.
* `0, 0, 0`: All elements are 0.

Using these observations, we can apply the pattern to generate the output for the test input:

* For the first element of the test input (`0`), we add 1 to it, so the output for this element is 1.
* For the second element of the test input (`3`), we replace it with the value in the same position of the previous row (`3`), so the output for this element is also 3.
* For the third element of the test input (`3`), we again replace it with the value in the same position of the previous row (`3`), so the output for this element is also 3.

Therefore, the output for the test input is `1, 3, 3`.
