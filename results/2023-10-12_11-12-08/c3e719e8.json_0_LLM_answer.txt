LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems like the pattern for each input is to shift the values in the input by one position to the right, and then add the corresponding value from the output array. Here's how you can apply this pattern to the final test input:

Test input: `1, 1, 7`

Shift the values in the input by one position to the right: `2, 1, 7`

Add the corresponding value from the output array: `2 + 0 = 2`

Therefore, the output for the test input is `2`.

Similarly, you can apply this pattern to the other test input:

Test input: `7, 4, 1`

Shift the values in the input by one position to the right: `8, 4, 1`

Add the corresponding value from the output array: `8 + 0 = 8`

Therefore, the output for the second test input is also `8`.

So, the final output for both test inputs is `8`.

Solution:
1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0
7, 4, 1, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0
5, 1, 7, 5, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 7
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0
