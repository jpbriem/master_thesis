LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. From the information provided, it seems that the pattern for each input is to take the number in each position (row, column) and add it to the corresponding position in the output matrix. For example, in the first input, the value in the top left corner (0, 0) is added to the corresponding position in the output matrix, resulting in the value 0. Similarly, the value in the second row (2, 2) is added to the corresponding position in the output matrix, resulting in the value 8.

Using this pattern, you can apply it to the test input:

Test input:
2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8
2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8
0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0
8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8

Applying the pattern, we get:

Output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

So, the test output is also [8].
