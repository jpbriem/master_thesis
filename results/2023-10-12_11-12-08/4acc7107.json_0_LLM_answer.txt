LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a set of input values into their corresponding output values. Here's how I can help you solve it:

From your description, I understand that the input values are represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a different input, and the output values are also represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a different output. The catch is that the input and output values are not necessarily numerical values; they could be anything that follows certain rules or patterns.

To start solving the puzzle, I will need to analyze the input values and identify any patterns or rules that might govern how they are transformed into the output values. Once I have identified these patterns, I can use them to develop a strategy for applying the transformation rule to the input values and generating the corresponding output values.

Do you have any specific hints or clues about the nature of the input and output values? For example, do they follow any particular format or structure? Are there any constraints on the values that can appear in the input or output positions? Any information you can provide will help me narrow down the possible solutions and find the correct answer more quickly.
