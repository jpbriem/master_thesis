LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the instructions you provided, I understand that the goal is to identify a step-by-step pattern for converting a given input into an output, where the input and output are represented as rows of numbers (representing a 2D grid) with values from 0-9.

From the examples provided, it seems that the pattern involves performing the following operations on each row of the input:

1. If the value in the first position of the row is 0, then set all the values in the row to 0.
2. If the value in the second position of the row is 0, then set all the values in the row to 0.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each position in the row.
4. If the value in the last position of the row is 0, then set all the values in the row to 0.

Using this pattern, we can apply it to the test input:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
Output: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0

Explanation:

* Row 1: Value in position 1 is 0, so set all values in row to 0.
* Row 2: Value in position 0 is 0, so set all values in row to 0.
*...
* Row n: Value in position n is 0, so set all values in row to 0.
* Last row: Value in position n is 1, so set all values in row to 1.

Therefore, the output for the test input is:

0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0

Please provide me with another input to apply the pattern to.
