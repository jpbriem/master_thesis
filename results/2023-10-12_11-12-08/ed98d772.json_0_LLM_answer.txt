LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've been given a series of input-output pairs for a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform an input into an output. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

1. Observe the patterns in the input-output pairs:
	* In each pair, the first number in the input is always 0.
	* The second number in the input is always 3.
	* The third number in the input is always 0.
	* The output has three rows, where each row contains the same value (either 0 or 3).
2. Apply these patterns to the test input:
	* Start by setting the first number in the test input to 0.
	* Set the second number in the test input to 3.
	* Set the third number in the test input to 0.
	* Transform the input into an output using the patterns observed in the training examples:
