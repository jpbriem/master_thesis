LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the examples you provided:

1. Step-by-step pattern for getting the output from an input:
	* For each row of the input, perform the following operations:
		+ If the value in the first column is 0, set the output to 0.
		+ Otherwise, if the value in the first column is greater than or equal to 2, set the output to 2.
		+ If the value in the second column is 5, set the output to 4.
		+ Otherwise, if the value in the second column is greater than or equal to 5, set the output to 8.
		+ If the value in the third column is 3, set the output to 3.
		+ Otherwise, if the value in the third column is greater than or equal to 3, set the output to 4.
		+ If the value in the fourth column is 0, set the output to 0.
		+ Otherwise, if the value in the fourth column is greater than or equal to 5, set the output to 8.
		+ If the value in the fifth column is 0, set the output to 0.
		+ Otherwise, if the value in the fifth column is greater than or equal to 5, set the output to 8.
2. Apply the pattern to the test input:
	* The test input is:
	
		| 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |
		| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
		| 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 0 |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 0 |
	* Using the pattern we identified earlier, we can compute the output for each row of the test input as follows:
	
		| Row | Output |
		| --- | --- |
		| 1 | 2 |
		| 2 | 8 |
		| 3 | 4 |
		| 4 | 8 |
		| 5 | 4 |
		| 6 | 6 |
		| 7 | 7 |
	* Therefore, the test output is:
	
		| 2 | 8 | 4 | 8 | 6 | 7 |

Great job on providing a clear and concise description of the problem and the steps involved in solving it!
