LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve some puzzles. The steps to get the output from an input are as follows:

1. Iterate through each row of the input matrix.
2. For each row, multiply the values in that row by the corresponding value in the output matrix.
3. Add up the products of each row and column to get the final output value for that position in the output matrix.

Let's apply these steps to the test input you provided:

Test Input:
[9, 7, 9]
[9, 9, 7]
[7, 9, 7]

We will use the following output matrix:

Output Matrix:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let's iterate through each row of the test input and apply the multiplication:

Row 1: [9, 7, 9]
Multiplication: [9 x 0 = 0], [7 x 0 = 0], [9 x 0 = 0]
Final Output: [0, 0, 0]

Row 2: [9, 9, 7]
Multiplication: [9 x 0 = 0], [9 x 1 = 9], [7 x 0 = 0]
Final Output: [0, 9, 0]

Row 3: [7, 9, 7]
Multiplication: [7 x 0 = 0], [9 x 1 = 9], [7 x 1 = 7]
Final Output: [0, 0, 7]

The final output for the test input is [0, 0, 7].

Solution:
0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7
9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9
9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7
7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7
