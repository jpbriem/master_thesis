LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have provided me with a set of input-output pairs for a classification problem. I will now use these examples to train a model that can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

To start, I will create a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing 5 neurons. Each neuron will have a linear activation function, and the weights of the connections between the input and hidden layers will be initialized randomly.

For each training example, I will pass the input through the network and compute the predicted output. I will then compare the predicted output to the actual output, and adjust the weights of the connections between the layers to minimize the difference between the two. This process is known as backpropagation, and it allows the network to learn from the examples it has seen.

Once the network has been trained on all of the training examples, I will test it on a new input that it has never seen before. I will pass this input through the network, and compute the predicted output. If the predicted output matches the actual output, then the network has learned something useful from the training examples. Otherwise, there may be some issue with the way the network was trained, such as overfitting or underfitting.

So, please provide me with the next test input, and I will run it through the network and report the predicted output.
