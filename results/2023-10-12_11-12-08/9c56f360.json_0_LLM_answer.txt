LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the pattern for each input is to shift the values in the row by one position to the right, while maintaining the same value. So, if the top-left value in the input is 0, then the corresponding value in the output will be 8. If the top-left value is 8, then the corresponding value in the output will be 0.

Using this pattern, you can apply it to the test input:

Test input: 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8

Applying the pattern, we get:

Output: 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8

As expected, the output is the same as the test input. Now, try applying the pattern to other inputs and see how they produce different outputs. Good luck!

Solution:
0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8
0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8
0, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 3, 3, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0
