LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output.

From the first two examples, we can see that the output consists of four numbers, where each number represents the number of times a particular digit appears in the input. For instance, in the first example, the output is "2, 2, 2, 0", which means that the digit "2" appears twice in the input.

Based on this observation, we can conclude that the pattern in the output is:

Output = Number of times digit appears in input

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: 0, 3, 0, 3

Using the pattern above, we can calculate the output for the test input as follows:

Output = Number of times digit appears in input
= Number of times 0 appears in input (0) + Number of times 3 appears in input (3)
= 0 + 3
= 3

Therefore, the output for the test input is 3.

Let's repeat this process for the remaining test input:

Test input: 3, 3, 0, 3

Using the pattern above, we can calculate the output for the test input as follows:

Output = Number of times digit appears in input
= Number of times 3 appears in input (3) + Number of times 0 appears in input (0)
= 3 + 0
= 3

Therefore, the output for the test input is also 3.

Finally, let's apply the pattern to the last test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 1, 1

Using the pattern above, we can calculate the output for the test input as follows:

Output = Number of times digit appears in input
= Number of times 0 appears in input (2) + Number of times 1 appears in input (2)
= 2 + 2
= 4

Therefore, the output for the test input is 4.

So, based on the provided examples and the application of the pattern, the output for any given input will be equal to the number of times the digit appears in the input.
