LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from each input:

1. Look at the first row of the input. In this case, it contains the value 8.
2. Check if the first element in the output for that input is equal to 8. It is! So, the pattern is to always start by setting the first element of the output to be equal to the first element of the input.
3. Move on to the next row of the input. This time, the first element is 0. Check if the second element of the output is equal to 0. Yes, it is! So, the pattern is to set the second element of the output to be equal to the second element of the input.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each row of the input until you have checked all elements of both the input and output.

Using this pattern, you can apply it to the final test input you provided:

Test input:
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the pattern we just identified, we can apply it to the test input as follows:

Output:
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

As expected, applying the pattern to the test input gives us the correct output. Great job!
