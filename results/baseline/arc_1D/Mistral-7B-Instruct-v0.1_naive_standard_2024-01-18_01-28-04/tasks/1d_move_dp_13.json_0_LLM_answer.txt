LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', '.', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'b']

Example_2:
input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', '.', 'b']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'b']

Example_3:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', 'b', '.']
output: ['.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'b', '.']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', '.', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'b', '.']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current character in the input sequence is not a dot (.), then it should be removed from the output sequence. Otherwise, it should be kept in the output sequence.
2. If there are two consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with one dot in the output sequence.
3. If there are three or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with two dots in the output sequence.
4. If there are four or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with three dots in the output sequence.
5. If there are five or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with four dots in the output sequence.
6. If there are six or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with five dots in the output sequence.
7. If there are seven or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with six dots in the output sequence.
8. If there are eight or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with seven dots in the output sequence.
9. If there are nine or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with eight dots in the output sequence.
10. If there are ten or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with nine dots in the output sequence.
11. If there are eleven or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with ten dots in the output sequence.
12. If there are twelve or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with eleven dots in the output sequence.
13. If there are thirteen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with ten dots in the output sequence.
14. If there are fourteen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with nine dots in the output sequence.
15. If there are fifteen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with eight dots in the output sequence.
16. If there are sixteen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with seven dots in the output sequence.
17. If there are seventeen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with six dots in the output sequence.
18. If there are eighteen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with five dots in the output sequence.
19. If there are nineteen or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with four dots in the output sequence.
20. If there are twenty or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with three dots in the output sequence.
21. If there are twenty-one or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with two dots in the output sequence.
22. If there are twenty-two or more consecutive dots in the input sequence, they should be replaced with one dot in the output sequence.

Note that if there are no consecutive dots in the input sequence, then all dots should be kept in the output sequence.
