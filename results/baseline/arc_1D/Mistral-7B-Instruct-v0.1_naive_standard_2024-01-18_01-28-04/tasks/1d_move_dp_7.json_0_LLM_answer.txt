LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', 'c', 'c', 'c', '.', '.', 'h']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'h']

Example_2:
input: ['b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', 'h']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'h']

Example_3:
input: ['c', 'c', 'c', '.', '.', '.', 'h']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'h']

Test case:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', '.', 'h']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'h']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input string. The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. If the current character in the input string is not a dot, replace it with a dot.
2. If the current character in the input string is a dot, remove it from the string.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all characters have been processed.

For example, for Example_1, the first character is a dot, so step 2 removes it from the string. The resulting string is '.c'. Then, since the next character is also a dot, step 2 removes it from the string. The resulting string is 'c'. This process continues until all characters have been processed.

Similarly, for Example_2, the first two characters are dots, so step 2 removes them from the string. The resulting string is 'b'. Since the next character is also a dot, step 2 removes it from the string. The resulting string is '.'. This process continues until all characters have been processed.

Finally, for Test case, the first three characters are dots, so step 2 removes them from the string. The resulting string is '.'. Since the next character is also a dot, step 2 removes it from the string. The resulting string is '.'. This process continues until all characters have been processed.
