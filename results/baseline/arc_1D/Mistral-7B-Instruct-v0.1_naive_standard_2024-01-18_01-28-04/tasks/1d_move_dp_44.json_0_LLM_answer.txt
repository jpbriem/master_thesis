LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['g', 'g', 'g', '.', '.', '.', 'i']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'i']

Example_2:
input: ['c', 'c', 'c', '.', '.', 'i', '.']
output: ['.', '.', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'i', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.', 'i']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'i']

Test case:
input: ['e', 'e', 'e', '.', '.', 'i', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', '.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'i']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input string. In this case, the rule is that if there are three consecutive occurrences of any character in the input string, then it should be replaced with a dot followed by the character. If there are two consecutive dots, they should be replaced with a single dot. Otherwise, all characters should remain unchanged.

For example, in Example_1, the input string contains four consecutive 'g's, which are replaced with four dots followed by 'g'. Similarly, in Example_2, the input string contains three consecutive 'c's, which are replaced with three dots followed by 'c'. In Example_3, the input string contains three consecutive 'h's, which are replaced with three dots followed by 'h'. Finally, in Test case, the input string contains three consecutive 'e's, which are replaced with three dots followed by 'e'.
