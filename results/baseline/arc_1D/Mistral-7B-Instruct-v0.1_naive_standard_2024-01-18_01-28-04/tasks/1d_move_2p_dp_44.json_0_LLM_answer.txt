LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['g', 'g', 'g', '.', '.', 'f', '.']
output: ['.', '.', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'f', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['c', 'c', 'c', '.', '.', 'f', '.']
output: ['.', '.', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'f', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', 'f', '.']
output: ['.', '.', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'f', '.']

Test case:
input: ['e', 'e', 'e', '.', '.', 'f', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'f', '.']

Explanation:
In each example, the input string is a sequence of characters representing a word. The output string is obtained by applying a simple rule to the input string. Specifically, if there exists an even number of consecutive occurrences of any character in the input string, then this character should be replaced with a dot (.) in the output string. Otherwise, all characters in the input string should remain unchanged in the output string.

For example, in Example_1, the input string contains four consecutive occurrences of 'g' followed by three dots. Applying the rule results in the output string containing two dots followed by three 'g's and one f. Similarly, in Example_2, the input string contains three consecutive occurrences of 'c' followed by three dots. Applying the rule results in the output string containing two dots followed by three 'c's and one f. In Example_3, the input string contains three consecutive occurrences of 'h' followed by three dots. Applying the rule results in the output string containing two dots followed by three 'h's and one f. Finally, in Test case, the input string contains three consecutive occurrences of 'e' followed by three dots. Applying the rule results in the output string containing two dots followed by three 'e's and one f.
