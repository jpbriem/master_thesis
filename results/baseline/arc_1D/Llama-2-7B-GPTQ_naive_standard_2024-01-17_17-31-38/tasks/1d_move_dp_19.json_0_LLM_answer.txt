LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', '.', '.', 'a', 'a', 'a', '.', '.', 'c', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', '.', '.', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', '.', '.', 'c', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'c', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'c']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'c']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'c', '.']
