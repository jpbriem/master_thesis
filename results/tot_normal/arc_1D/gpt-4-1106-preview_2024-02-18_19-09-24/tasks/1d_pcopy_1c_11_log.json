The first object is always three pixels in size, and the second object is always a single pixel in size. The objects are separated by a variable number of background pixels.\noutput: Each output sequence contains two objects of the same color. The first object remains unchanged in size and position. The second object is transformed to match the size of the first object and is moved to immediately follow the first object, separated by a single background pixel.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects change if there are exactly two objects of the same color, with the first being three pixels in size and the second being a single pixel\noverall pattern: For any input with two objects of the same color, where the first object is three pixels and the second is one pixel, transform the second object to be three pixels in size and move it to immediately follow the first object with one background pixel separating them\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the first object of three pixels in size and leave it unchanged.', 'Identify the second object of a single pixel in size.', 'Transform the second object to match the size of the first object, making it three pixels in size.', 'Move the newly sized second object to immediately follow the first object.', 'Ensure there is a single background pixel (0) separating the first and second objects.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output sequence cannot be determined without applying the transformation steps to the test input sequence.
