#############################Sample Prompt:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern: For each color present in the input, identify the largest object by size. Remove all other objects of that color. Retain the largest object in its entire length and color, and move it to the starting position of the first object of that color. Fill the rest of the sequence with background color (0).

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

description:
input: Objects in the input sequences are contiguous pixels of the same color, separated by background color pixels (0). Each object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size, which is the count of pixels. Objects can vary in size and position.
output: Objects in the output sequences are similar to those in the input but transformed according to certain rules. In these examples, the largest object of a specific color is retained while other objects of the same color are removed, regardless of their initial positions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size. The largest object of a given color is retained while smaller objects of the same color are removed.
overall pattern: For each color present in the input, identify all objects of that color. Determine the largest object by size. Retain only the largest object of each color in the output at its original position, and remove all other objects of the same color. Background pixels remain unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects, which are sequences of non-zero adjacent pixels', 'For each color found, group the objects of that color', 'Within each group, compare the sizes of the objects to find the largest one', 'Keep the largest object of each color in its original position', 'Remove all other objects of the same color by replacing their pixels with background color (0)', 'Leave all background pixels (0) and non-target color objects unchanged']

description:
input: Objects in the input sequences are contiguous pixels of the same color, separated by background color pixels (0). Each object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size, which is the count of pixels. Objects can vary in size and position.
output: Objects in the output sequences are similar to those in the input but transformed according to certain rules. In these examples, the largest object of a specific color is retained while other objects of the same color are removed, regardless of their initial positions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size relative to other objects of the same color. The largest object is retained, and others are removed.
overall pattern: For each color, identify the largest object (by size). Retain this object while removing all other objects of the same color. Objects are unchanged if they are the only object of that color or already the largest.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence. An object is defined by a consecutive sequence of non-zero pixels of the same color.', 'For each color found in the objects, determine the size of each object of that color.', 'Identify the largest object for each color by comparing sizes. If there are multiple objects of the same size, the first occurrence is considered the largest.', 'Retain the largest object of each color in the output sequence, and remove all other objects of that color by replacing their pixels with zeros.', 'Maintain the positions of the retained objects in the output sequence as they were in the input sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

description:
input: Objects in the input sequences are contiguous pixels of the same color, separated by background color pixels (0). Each object is defined by its color, starting index, ending index, and size, which is the count of pixels. Objects can vary in size and position.
output: Objects in the output sequences are similar to those in the input but transformed according to certain rules. In these examples, the largest object of a specific color is retained while other objects of the same color are removed, regardless of their initial positions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size. The largest object of a given color is retained while smaller objects of the same color are removed.
overall pattern: For each color present in the input, identify all objects of that color. Determine the largest object by size. Retain only the largest object of each color in the output at its original position, and remove all other objects of the same color. Background pixels remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects, defined as contiguous non-zero pixels of the same color.', 'For each color, create a list of objects along with their sizes.', 'Within each list for a color, identify the object with the largest size. If there is a tie, select the object that occurs first in the sequence.', 'Create an output sequence initialized with all background color pixels (0s) of the same length as the input sequence.', 'Copy the largest object of each color to the corresponding position in the output sequence. If an object spans multiple indices, copy the entire object.', 'Leave all other pixels as the background color (0) in the output sequence.']
