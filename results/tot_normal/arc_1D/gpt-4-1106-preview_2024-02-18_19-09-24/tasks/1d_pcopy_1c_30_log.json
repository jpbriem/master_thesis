The size of the first object determines the size of the subsequent objects.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the first object and its size. Then, scale all subsequent objects of the same color to match the size of the first object, maintaining their original order and color. The transformation is specific to objects that are not the first object but share the same color as the first object.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions correctly refer to the input sequence, identifying the first larger object and subsequent smaller objects of the same color.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output, where subsequent objects of the same color as the first object are scaled to match its size.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it clearly states the rule for scaling subsequent objects.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are relevant as they focus on the input sequence's objects and their colors, which are essential for determining the changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation process, ensuring that smaller objects of the same color are resized to match the first object.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, providing a clear method for identifying and resizing objects based on the first object's size.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are appropriate, as they pertain to the input sequence and the characteristics of the objects that will undergo transformation.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation, where the size of the first object dictates the size of subsequent objects of the same color.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, offering a specific rule for adjusting the size of objects that share the color of the first object.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions correctly refer to the input sequence, identifying the first larger object and subsequent smaller objects of the same color.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output, where subsequent objects of the same color as the first object are scaled to match its size.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it clearly states the rule for scaling subsequent objects.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are relevant as they focus on the input sequence's objects and their colors, which are essential for determining the changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation process, ensuring that smaller objects of the same color are resized to match the first object.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, providing a clear method for identifying and resizing objects based on the first object's size.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are appropriate, as they pertain to the input sequence and the characteristics of the objects that will undergo transformation.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation, where the size of the first object dictates the size of subsequent objects of the same color.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, offering a straightforward approach to transforming the input sequence based on the first object's properties.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  }\n}\n###########################################################\nNo Valuation - Duplicate candidate"
