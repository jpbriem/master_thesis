The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Focus on conditions explaining the transformation\"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change?

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.
