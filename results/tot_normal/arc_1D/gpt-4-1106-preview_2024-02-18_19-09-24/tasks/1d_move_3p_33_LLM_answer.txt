#############################Sample Prompt:

system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given input description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other inputs.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given output description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other outputs.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

overall pattern: the object, regardless of its color or initial position, is moved 3 places to the right while retaining its size and color

input: All input sequences contain a single object, which is a contiguous block of same-colored pixels surrounded by background color pixels. The object begins and ends within the sequence, not at the edges.
output: All output sequences also contain a single object, which retains its original color and size. The transformation appears to be a shift of the object's position to the right by a fixed number of pixels.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change their position if they are not starting at the edges of the sequence
overall pattern: the object, regardless of its color or initial position, is moved 3 places to the right while retaining its size and color


transformation steps: ['Identify the object within the input sequence.', 'Calculate the size of the object by counting the number of adjacent non-zero pixels.', 'Determine the starting index of the object within the sequence.', "Shift the entire object 3 places to the right by inserting three '0's directly before the first non-zero pixel of the object.", 'Retain the original color and size of the object during the shift.', "Ensure the sequence length remains the same by removing the last three pixels after the shift, which will be '0's as the object does not start at the edge.", 'If the object is already at the right edge, no transformation is applied.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.

Evaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: All input sequences contain a single object, which is a contiguous block of same-colored pixels surrounded by background color pixels. The object begins and ends within the sequence, not at the edges.
output: All output sequences also contain a single object, which retains its original color and size. The transformation appears to be a shift of the object's position to the right by a fixed number of pixels.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change their position if they are not starting at the edges of the sequence
overall pattern: the object, regardless of its color or initial position, is moved 3 places to the right while retaining its size and color


transformation steps: ['Identify the object within the input sequence.', 'Calculate the size of the object by counting the number of adjacent non-zero pixels.', 'Determine the starting index of the object within the sequence.', "Shift the entire object 3 places to the right by inserting three '0's directly before the first non-zero pixel of the object.", 'Retain the original color and size of the object during the shift.', "Ensure the sequence length remains the same by removing the last three pixels after the shift, which will be '0's as the object does not start at the edge.", 'If the object is already at the right edge, no transformation is applied.']
