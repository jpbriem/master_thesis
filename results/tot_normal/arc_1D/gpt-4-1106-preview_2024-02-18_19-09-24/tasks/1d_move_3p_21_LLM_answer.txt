You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given input description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other inputs.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given output description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other outputs.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: Each input sequence contains a single object which can be identified by a continuous stretch of non-zero pixels of the same color.
output: Each output sequence also contains a single object. The object appears to have been moved towards the center of the sequence while maintaining its size and color.


overall pattern:
conditions: objects change based on their initial position in the sequence
overall pattern: for a given input with a single object, the object is transformed by moving it to the center of the sequence. The type of object that changes is the one that is not at the center. The reason it changes is to align the object with the center of the sequence. How it changes: the object is moved towards the center, equidistant from both ends of the sequence, while its size and color remain the same

description:
input: Each input sequence contains a single object which can be identified by a continuous stretch of non-zero pixels of the same color.
output: Each output sequence also contains a single object. The object appears to have been moved towards the center of the sequence while maintaining its size and color.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change position based on their size. The larger the object, the closer to the center it moves.
overall pattern: For any input with a single object, center the object within the sequence while maintaining its original size and color. The object is to be moved such that there is an equal number of background pixels (zeros) on both sides of the object, as closely as possible given an even or odd total sequence length.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

description:
input: Each input sequence contains a single object which can be identified by a continuous stretch of non-zero pixels of the same color.
output: Each output sequence also contains a single object. The object appears to have been moved towards the center of the sequence while maintaining its size and color.

overall pattern:
conditions: The object changes position if it is not already centered
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the single object within the sequence should be repositioned so that it is centered within the sequence. The object's color and size do not change. The object is moved towards the middle such that an equal number of background pixels (0s) are on either side of the object, if possible.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

description:
input: Each input sequence contains a single object which can be identified by a continuous stretch of non-zero pixels of the same color.
output: Each output sequence also contains a single object. The object appears to have been moved towards the center of the sequence while maintaining its size and color.

overall pattern:
conditions: The object changes position if it is not already centered
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the single object within the sequence should be repositioned so that it is centered within the sequence. The object's color and size do not change. The object is moved towards the middle such that an equal number of background pixels (0s) are on either side of the object, if possible.


transformation steps: ['Identify the single object in the input sequence by finding the continuous stretch of non-zero pixels of the same color.', 'Calculate the size of the object by counting the number of non-zero pixels in the continuous stretch.', 'Determine the current position of the object by noting the start and end indices of the continuous stretch.', 'Calculate the total length of the input sequence.', 'Determine the desired centered position for the object, which is the position where the number of background pixels (0s) before and after the object is as equal as possible.', "Calculate the number of background pixels that should be placed before and after the object to center it.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

description:
input: Each input sequence contains a single object which can be identified by a continuous stretch of non-zero pixels of the same color.
output: Each output sequence also contains a single object. The object appears to have been moved towards the center of the sequence while maintaining its size and color.

overall pattern:
conditions: The object changes position if it is not already centered
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the single object within the sequence should be repositioned so that it is centered within the sequence. The object's color and size do not change. The object is moved towards the middle such that an equal number of background pixels (0s) are on either side of the object, if possible.


transformation steps: ['Identify the single object by locating the continuous stretch of non-zero pixels', 'Calculate the size of the object by counting the number of adjacent non-zero pixels of the same color', 'Determine the total length of the input sequence', 'Calculate the number of background pixels (0s) by subtracting the size of the object from the total length', 'Divide the number of background pixels by 2 to find the number of 0s that should be on each side of the object for it to be centered', 'If the number of background pixels is odd, one side will have one more 0 than the other, the side with the extra 0 is determined by the initial position of the object in the input sequence', 'Construct the output sequence by placing the calculated number of 0s at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the object, and then the remaining 0s at the end of the sequence', 'Ensure that the total length of the output sequence matches the total length of the input sequence']


Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

output: return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.

Evaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Value Outputs:

The input sequence has an object composed of the color 1 with a size of 7 pixels. According to the transformation steps, the object is identified, and its size is determined (step 1 and 2). The total length of the input sequence is 16 (step 3). There are 9 background pixels (step 4), which when divided by 2 gives 4.5. Since the number is odd, one side should have one more 0 than the other (step 5 and 6). The initial object was closer to the start of the sequence, so the extra 0 is placed at the end, resulting in the sequence starting with 5 background pixels, followed by the object of size 7, and ending with 4 background pixels (step 7). The output sequence length matches the input sequence length (step 8). Thus, the transformation was applied correctly.", "value": 10}
