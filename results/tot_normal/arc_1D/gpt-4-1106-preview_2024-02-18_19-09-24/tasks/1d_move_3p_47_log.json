The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nEvaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given input description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other inputs.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given output description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other outputs.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

This object is surrounded by background pixels (0).\noutput: The output sequence also contains a single object with the same size and color as the input object.
