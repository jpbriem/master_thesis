The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}.

Objects are separated by varying lengths of background pixels.\noutput: Each output sequence contains objects of the same color as the input. The first object remains unchanged, while subsequent objects of size 1 in the input are transformed into objects of size 3 in the output. The transformed objects are separated by a single background pixel.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects change if they are single pixel objects following the first object; the first object does not change\noverall pattern: retain the first object of size three; transform each subsequent single pixel object into an object of size three, separated by one background pixel; retain the color of all objects\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the first object of size three and leave it unchanged', 'For each subsequent object of size one, replace it with an object of size three of the same color', 'Ensure that each transformed object of size three is followed by a single background pixel before the next object', 'If there are multiple background pixels before a single pixel object, reduce them to a single background pixel after the transformation', 'Retain the original sequence length by adjusting the number of trailing background pixels']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output sequence does not follow the transformation steps correctly.

Instead, it remains a single pixel object in the output. According to the transformation steps, it should have been replaced with an object of size three of the same color, followed by a single background pixel. The output sequence should have had a '7' at indices 8, 9, and 10, followed by a '0' at index 11. The rest of the sequence should be background pixels.
