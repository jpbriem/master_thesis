#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, the objects always consist of continuous regions of identical non-zero color values, where smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

In this case, the condition holds true for both the input and output objects. It seems relevant to determining the object changes.",

    "value": 10
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Regarding the second example, the condition holds true for both the input and output objects, aligning well with the description.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Comparing the input and output for the second example, we see that the pattern accurately describes the transformation - multiple separate objects combining into a single object without overlapping.",

  }
}
```

Overall, the given conditions and patterns seem accurate and precise in explaining the transformations seen in these three examples. I would rate the quality of information at 10 out of 10 considering the problem statement and context provided.
------
 Here's the JSON formatted response:

```json
{
    "Example_1": {
        "conditions_analysis": "Regarding the first example, the given conditions accurately describe the input, specifying that objects must be continuous regions of identical non-zero color values and allowing for nested objects. These conditions are relevant to determining the object changes.",
        "overall_pattern_analysis": "Regarding the first example, the given overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output. It states that small, isolated objects will combine with nearby objects of the same color, which occurs in this example (object color 2 combines). The combined object maintains its color and increases in size while shifting to a central location, also demonstrated in the example.",
        "precision_analysis": "Regarding the first example, the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output. However, without more specific criteria defining'small' and 'nearby', some ambiguity remains. Nonetheless, the provided information suffices for these particular input-output pairs.",
        "value": 9
    },
    "Example_2": {
       ...
    },
    "Example_3": {
       ...
    }
}
```

In `Example_2`, the conditions and overall pattern follow suit – the description explains how smaller objects merge together when enclosed by the same color. In `Example_3`, despite having longer regions initially separated by single-pixel separators, those too become connected since they fit the mentioned condition ("smaller isolated regions...surrounded by zeros").

Overall, the precision could benefit from further clarification about what constitutes a'small' object and how close another object needs to be to trigger merging. But based on the current dataset, these rules seem sufficient.

(Replace `...` with similarly structured content like above.)

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change depending on their colors, positions, and sizes relative to other noise pixels (0). When two or more objects of the same color are separated by noise pixels, they combine into a single object.
overall pattern: To create the output, analyze the input by considering the following steps: 
1. Identify objects by finding continuous regions of non-zero color values.
2. Classify objects according to their distinct colors.
3. Examine the relationships between adjacent objects separated by noise pixels.
4. Merge objects with the same color that are split apart by noise pixels.
5. Determine the new position and size of objects according to their original locations and the removed noise pixels around them.

By applying these rules to the entire input sequence, a consistent output sequence can be generated.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, the objects always consist of continuous regions of identical non-zero color values, where smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects.
output: Across all output sequences, the objects consist of contiguous regions of identical non-zero color values, where each region contains exactly one original object without any gaps or overlaps.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they have the same color value and are separated by noise pixels. Objects remain unchanged when they are already connected.
overall pattern: For each color value, if separated objects exist, combine them into a single object covering all input positions with that color. If objects are already connected, leave them unchanged. This results in the output object having the smallest possible start_index while maintaining the largest possible end_index for its color value.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, each sequence contains multiple objects of varying sizes and colors. Some objects may be adjacent to each other, while others may be separated by noise pixels (0).
output: Across all output sequences, each sequence contains a single object composed of all the pixels that were part of the original objects in the corresponding input sequence, but without any gaps (noise pixels) present in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when there are noise pixels between them in the input. These pixels get removed, causing the objects to merge.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, first find all objects ignoring noise pixels. Then, combine those objects into a single object in the output where noise pixels used to reside. Ensure individual object colors remain consistent throughout this process.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, the objects always consist of continuous regions of identical non-zero color values, where smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects.
output: Across all output sequences, the objects consist of contiguous regions of identical non-zero color values, where each region contains exactly one original object without any gaps or overlaps.

overall pattern:

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, the objects always consist of continuous regions of identical non-zero color values, where smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects.
output: Across all output sequences, the objects consist of contiguous regions of identical non-zero color values, where each region contains exactly one original object without any gaps or overlaps.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change depending on their colors, positions, and sizes relative to other noise pixels (0). When two or more objects of the same color are separated by noise pixels, they combine into a single object.
overall pattern: To create the output, analyze the input by considering the following steps: 
1. Identify objects by finding continuous regions of non-zero color values.
2. Classify objects according to their distinct colors.
3. Examine the relationships between adjacent objects separated by noise pixels.
4. Merge objects with the same color that are split apart by noise pixels.
5. Determine the new position and size of objects according to their original locations and the removed noise pixels around them.

By applying these rules to the entire input sequence, a consistent output sequence can be generated.

input: Across all input sequences, the objects always consist of continuous regions of identical non-zero color values, where smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects.
output: Across all output sequences, the objects consist of contiguous regions of identical non-zero color values, where each region contains exactly one original object without any gaps or overlaps.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change depending on their colors, positions, and sizes relative to other noise pixels (0). When two or more objects of the same color are separated by noise pixels, they combine into a single object.
overall pattern: To create the output, analyze the input by considering the following steps: 
1. Identify objects by finding continuous regions of non-zero color values.
2. Classify objects according to their distinct colors.
3. Examine the relationships between adjacent objects separated by noise pixels.
4. Merge objects with the same color that are split apart by noise pixels.
5. Determine the new position and size of objects according to their original locations and the removed noise pixels around them.

By applying these rules to the entire input sequence, a consistent output sequence can be generated.

Value Outputs:
 Here is the evaluation and analysis of the given transformation steps for each example:

Example\_1:
-------------

Transformation Analysis:
------------------------

The transformation steps correctly identify the objects in the input sequence and merge them when they are separated by noise pixels. However, the final step of determining the new position and size of the objects seems to be missing. Instead, the output sequence simply replaces all noise pixels (0) with zeros.

Transformation Value: 7/10

Example\_2:
-------------

Transformation Analysis:
------------------------

Similar to Example\_1, the transformation steps correctly identify the objects in the input sequence and merge them when they are separated by noise pixels. But again, the final step of determining the new position and size of the objects is missing. In this example, the output sequence has some extra leading and trailing zeros that were not present in the input sequence. This might indicate that the new position and size of the objects are not being calculated correctly.

Transformation Value: 6/10

Example\_3:
-------------

Transformation Analysis:
------------------------

In this example, the transformation steps fail to correctly identify the objects in the input sequence. Specifically, the second object starting at index 8 is missed entirely, resulting in incorrect merging and sizing of the objects in the output sequence. The reason for this failure is unclear, but it may be due to a mistake in the implementation of step 1 of identifying objects.

Transformation Value: 3/10

Overall Transformation Analysis:
-------------------------------

The transformation steps provide a good general approach to solving the problem, but they fall short in the final step of determining the new position and size of the objects. Additionally, there are issues with accurately identifying objects in the input sequence, particularly when they are adjacent to noise pixels. These problems result in inconsistent and sometimes incorrect output sequences.

To improve the transformation steps, more attention needs to be paid to calculating the new position and size of the objects in the output sequence. This calculation should take into account the removed noise pixels and adjust the start and end indices accordingly. Additionally, further testing and validation of the object identification step is needed to ensure accurate detection of objects in the input sequence, especially when they are adjacent to noise pixels.

Overall Transformation Value: 5/10
------
 Here's the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly identify, classify, merge, and determine the new position and size of the objects. However, step 5 could be more specific about removing noise pixels before calculating new sizes.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps work correctly for this example too, handling cases where multiple objects of the same color are present and need merging. Again, step 5 could provide clearer instructions about removing noise pixels.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps are applicable here as well, accounting for objects with varying sizes and positions. Step 5 would benefit from specifying how noise pixels are removed prior to recalculating sizes.",
    "value": 8
  }
}
```

In general, the transformation steps appear to be mostly correct and sufficient for the described problem. However, some improvements could be made to make step 5 more explicit about removing noise pixels before determining new sizes and updating the input sequence. This will help ensure consistency across various input-output pairs.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify objects in the input sequence and merge them when split apart by noise pixels.

The transformation steps generally work well for identifying and merging objects; however, there is room for improvement in determining the correct positions and sizes of merged objects after eliminating noise pixels.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

output: Across all output sequences, the objects consist of contiguous regions of identical non-zero color values, where each region contains exactly one original object without any gaps or overlaps.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they are smaller isolated regions of identical non-zero color values surrounded by zeros.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the test input sequence using the described transformation steps. We will analyze how well each step has been applied to the test case.

Step 1 - Identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence:
* In this particular test case, we don't have any small, isolated objects according to the description since none of the non-zero colored parts is completely surrounded by zeros. Therefore, it seems like no combination occurred based on the step 1 condition alone. However, the test output indicates otherwise.

Rating so far: 0 out of 10; incorrect identification of small, isolated objects.

Since Step 1 has not been satisfied, further steps do not need assessment here. But let's check the whole test input and output anyway just for understanding purposes.

Test Input Sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test Output Sequence (analyzing even though the previous step failed):
[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 2 - Combine identified small, isolated objects with neighboring objects of the same color if there is no other object of the same color between them:

* Since the first step didn't find any small, isolated objects, this step was skipped entirely. As per the instructions, combining small isolated objects isn't applicable because none were found.

Step 3-6: Maintain the combined objects' color, Increase the size of the combined objects, Shift the combined objects to a central location between the initial objects.

* Again, these steps cannot be evaluated properly due to the failure in identifying small, isolated objects that could have been combined in the first place.

Overall Rating: 0 out of 10. The test output analysis reveals that the test case did not meet the specified conditions for the transformation process. Further clarifications or modifications may be required regarding the definition or detection criteria of small, isolated objects before reevaluating the test case.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence. In this case, there is only one small, isolated object: the 2 at position 37, since it is completely surrounded by zeros.

Next, we check if this small, isolated object can be combined with a neighboring object of the same color if there is no other object of the same color between them. Since the 2 at position 37 is next to another object of the same color (at positions 1-14), they can be combined according to the specified conditions.

However, upon comparing the test output sequence to the expected result, we notice that the combination has not been performed correctly. The 2 at position 37 should have been combined with the other 2s earlier in the sequence. Instead, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.

Therefore, based on the observed inconsistency, the value assigned would be 3 out of 10 due to incorrect implementation of the second transformation step. The first step appears to have been executed properly, but subsequent steps need further refinement.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation steps and the test input sequence, it seems like the expected operation would be to identify small, isolated objects of a certain color and then combine them with neighboring objects of the same color, maintaining the combined objects' color and increasing their size. However, upon comparing the provided test input and output sequences, we can observe several discrepancies that suggest incorrect application of the transformation process.

For instance, at the beginning of the test input sequence, we see a group of nine consecutive twos followed by another two. In the provided output sequence, this same group of ten twos has been changed to three groups of two twos separated by zeroes. Additionally, further along in the sequence, there is a single two, but in the output sequence, it has been replaced by a group of four twos.

Given these observations, it appears that the transformation algorithm was likely not applied correctly to the test input sequence. To provide a more quantitative assessment, I would rate the accuracy of the test output sequence as a 1 out of 10, reflecting the significant deviation from what would be expected based on the given transformation steps.

Overall, it would seem prudent to reevaluate both the transformation algorithm and its application to ensure accurate and consistent results.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence against the test input sequence. We'll examine each step of the transformation algorithm:

1. Identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence:
   - Test Input: There are two isolated objects of color 2 at positions 1-8 and 17-26.
   - Test Output: After this step, we would expect these isolated objects to remain unchanged since they meet the criteria defined in the parameters.

2. Combine identified small, isolated objects with neighboring objects of the same color if there is no other object of the same color between them:
   - Test Input: Since the isolated objects were not changed in step 1, they should now be combined. However, due to the absence of other objects of the same color between them, combining these objects does not apply here.
   - Test Output: Observe the colored sections; it appears that some combinations occurred incorrectly. The first section of color 2 has been reduced in length, violating the overall pattern.

3. Maintain the combined objects' color:
   - Test Input: As stated before, we don't observe any merging after step 1. Therefore, the color maintenance operation is not applicable in this scenario.
   - Test Output: Given the previous issue found with the combination step, analyzing this step further is unnecessary.

4. Increase the size of the combined objects:
   - Test Input: This step is irrelevant due to the lack of proper combinations.
   - Test Output: Again, due to improper combinations in step 2, this step cannot be evaluated accurately.

5. Shift the combined objects to a central location between the initial objects:
   - Test Input: No merging took place, making this step redundant.
   - Test Output: Not evaluable based on earlier findings.

Based on our evaluation, the test output sequence failed to adhere to the specified description, overall pattern, and transformation steps. Thus, the test output must receive a 0 out of 10 for failing the core algorithm components.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the given test case:

1. Identifying small, isolated objects: There are two isolated objects in the input sequence - one at the beginning with color 2, and another one at the end with color 2. They are both surrounded by zeros.

2. Combining identified small, isolated objects: Since these objects are at the extremes of the sequence and there are no other objects of the same color between them, they would be combined. This results in a single object of color 2.

3. Maintaining the combined objects' color: As per the rules, the combined object should retain its color. So, the resulting object remains color 2.

4. Increasing the size of the combined objects: After combination, the size of the object increases. In this case, it becomes 17 units long (from index 1 to 18).

5. Shifting the combined objects to a central location: The combined object should now be shifted to a central location between the initial objects. However, since the initial objects were at the extremes, there isn't a central location within the original positions. Therefore, the combined object should ideally be placed in the middle of the sequence.

Given the above steps, a correct test output sequence should look like this:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, the provided test output sequence is [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. It fails to meet the expectations based on step 5. Therefore, the test output cannot be considered correct.

Answer:

  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
  "value": 6
}
------
 Based on the given information, we can infer that the task involves identifying and combining small, isolated objects (regions of identical non-zero color values) in the input sequence that are completely surrounded by zeros and shifting them to a central location between the initial objects while maintaining their color and increasing their size. Let's evaluate the given test input sequence using this transformation process.

Firstly, let's identify the small, isolated objects in the input sequence:

* There is one isolated object of color 2 at positions 1 to 15.

Next, since there are no other objects of the same color between the isolated object and the larger object, we combine these two objects:

* Combining object of color 2 at positions 1 to 15 with the object of color 2 at positions 16 to 17 results in a single object of color 2 spanning positions 1 to 17.

Finally, we need to check whether the output has been provided correctly for our test input sequence. Since it hasn't been provided, let's assume that the combined object undergoes central shift, color maintenance, and size increase. In that case, the resulting output would be:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, note that the actual output may vary depending on the implementation of the central shift, color maintenance, and size increase operations. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive judgement about the correctness of the output based on the information provided.

Based on the above analysis, I recommend providing a test output sequence to compare against the expected result. However, assuming the test output sequence follows the described transformation process, I rate the test output sequence as 8 out of 10. This rating reflects the possibility of variations in the implementation of the central shift, color maintenance, and size increase operations.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence. In this case, the small, isolated object is `[2, 0, 0, 0, 2]` since it is completely surrounded by zeros.

Next, we combine identified small, isolated objects with neighboring objects of the same color if there is no other object of the same color between them. However, in the test case, the small, isolated object `[2, 0, 0, 0, 2]` does not meet this condition because there is another object of the same color (2) between them. Therefore, this step should not be applied.

Since the previous step should not have been applied, the remaining steps (maintaining the combined objects' color, increasing the size of the combined objects, and shifting the combined objects to a central location) also should not have been applied.

However, in the given test output, all the twos have been shifted towards the center, which contradicts the correct application of the transformation steps. Specifically, the second two should not have moved since it is part of the large group of connected twos on the left side.

Therefore, based on the provided transformation steps, the test output sequence was not generated correctly from the test input sequence.

Answer:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
"value": 3
}

Note: I am providing a rating of 3 because some parts of the transformation were applied (e.g., identifying the small, isolated object), but crucial steps were missed, and the resulting output did not match the expected outcome according to the provided description and overall pattern.
------
 Based on the analysis of each step of the transformation algorithm, here is the evaluation of the test output sequence:

1. **Identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence.**
   - In this step, we identify objects completely surrounded by zeros. We can see that in the given input sequence, the red region at the beginning (indices 1-7), middle (indices 16-23), and end (indices 38-40) meet this condition. However, according to the description provided, smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects. Therefore, the red regions at indices 1-7 and 16-23 should not be considered isolated since they are part of the larger red region spanning indices 1-23. Thus, the only truly isolated object in the input sequence is the red region at indices 38-40.
2. **Combine identified small, isolated objects with neighboring objects of the same color if there is no other object of the same color between them.**
   - Given the identification of isolated objects in step 1, the only eligible combination would be joining the red region at indices 38-40 with the nearest red region on its left at indices 1-23. Since there are no other red regions between these two areas, the combination step applies.
3. **Maintain the combined objects' color.**
   - This step requires keeping the color of the combined regions the same as before. Red and blue colors do not mix or alter; therefore, maintaining the color is straightforward.
4. **Increase the size of the combined objects.**
   - After combining the small red region at indices 38-40 with the adjacent red region starting at index 1, the size of the resulting red region grows. Now, instead of having sizes 2 and 15 for separate regions (before combination), we have a single region covering indices 1-23 with a total size of 23.
5. **Shift the combined objects to a central location between the initial objects.**
   - Here, the combined red region should ideally be shifted towards the center between the positions it previously held (indices 1-7, 16-23, and 38-40). A new position could be an average of those three locations or a spot close to the previous red areas. However, the given expected output does not exhibit such a central shift. Instead, the whole red area remains intact and unchanged after the third red element.

Taking all these points into consideration, I cannot approve of the suggested test output sequence based on the provided rules and constraints. There seems to be an inconsistency with step 5, mainly because the final output needs to incorporate the central shift mentioned in the overall pattern and transformation steps. As a result, my assessment is as follows:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Although most steps were followed accurately, the last step concerning shifting the combined objects to a central location did not occur properly, leading to an incorrect output.",

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence against the test input sequence using the described transformation steps.

First, we identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence. According to the description, an object is considered small and isolated when it is completely surrounded by zeros. In this case, the objects with color 2 at positions 28-30 form such an isolated object.

Next, we find the nearest object of the same color to the left and right for the identified object. Here, the nearest object on the left is at position 1 (also with color 2), and the nearest object on the right is at position 47 (again, with color 2).

Then, we calculate the central index between these two objects. Since they are located at positions 1 and 47, and considering that our sequence has a length of 34, the central index would be $((1 + 47) / 2) = 24$.

Now, we merge the identified object with the neighboring objects by updating their respective start and end indices to match the calculated central index. This means that the objects at positions 1 to 23 (before the isolated object) and positions 25 to 47 (after the isolated object) remain unchanged, whereas the isolated object at positions 24 to 26 needs to be updated. Thus, the new start index becomes 24 and the end index becomes 26.

After that, we maintain the color value of the merged objects, meaning that the color of the newly formed object remains 2.

Finally, since all isolated objects have been successfully merged, there are no more isolated objects left to remove. Based on these observations, it seems like the given test output sequence is the correct result after applying the described transformation algorithm to the test input sequence.

However, it should be noted that the evaluation is based solely on the given input-output pairs and description. There may still be edge cases where the transformation algorithm does not produce accurate results. Nevertheless, according to the current data, the transformation seems to have been applied correctly. Therefore, the output should be:

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Step 1: Identified the correct isolated object. Step 2: Found the correct left and right neighbors. Step 3: Calculated the central index accurately. Step 4: Merged the identified object with neighboring objects correctly. Step 5: Maintained the color value of the merged objects. Step 6: No further removal needed. Overall, the test output sequence appears to be the correct result after applying the transformation algorithm.', 'value': 10}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence (step 1). In this case, the isolated objects are at positions 37-38 (color 2), since they are completely surrounded by zeros. Next, we find the nearest object of the same color to the left and right (step 2) for the identified object. The nearest objects are located at positions 5-10 (also color 2).

Now, we calculate the central index between these two neighboring objects (step 3):

start\_index = 5 - 1 = 4
end\_index = 10 + 1 = 11
central\_index = (start\_index + end\_index) / 2 = (4 + 11) / 2 = 7.5
Since the central index must be an integer, we round it down to 7.

Then, we merge the identified object with the neighboring objects by updating their respective start and end indices (step 4) and maintain the color value of the merged objects (step 5). After merging, our new sequence becomes:

[0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 **2** 0 0 0 0 **2** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

However, this does not match the provided test output sequence. It seems like the test output sequence missed merging object 2 at positions 33-34, making the correct output sequence:

[0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 **2** 0 0 0 **2** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would rate the test output as follows:

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'Incorrect application of the transformation algorithm; specifically, the second instance of color 2 was not merged with neighboring objects as required.', 'value': '5'}

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation algorithm. Here's how it goes:

Test Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
Test Output: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Let's examine the transformation steps:

1. In this test case, the only small, isolated object surrounded by zeros is at position 28 (counting from 0). This seems correct so far.
2. We find the nearest object of the same color to the left (position 17) and to the right (positions starting from 29 do not qualify since we should stop looking after finding the first matching object). So yes, the correct neighbors were located.
3. Calculating the central index between positions 17 and 28 gives us 22.5, but since we cannot have half-indices, we choose the closest integer - 22. That also looks correct.
4. Updating the indices of the original object (position 28) and the neighboring object (position 17) to match the calculated central index results in merging the objects as expected.
5. Color maintenance is important too; fortunately, the color remains consistent throughout the process.
6. There do not seem to be any remaining isolated objects based on the final test output.

However, I notice something odd about the Test Case output regarding Step 4 of the Transformation Steps. There is another object of the same color near the combined object, namely the item at position 1. It does not appear to have been included in the merge, even though it qualifies according to Steps 2 and 3.

As a result, I would rate the test output as '**5 out of 10**'. To achieve better compatibility with the given rules, adjustments in Step 4 need to be made during testing. Otherwise, all checks pass accurately except the merging criterion involving multiple consecutive objects of the same color.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence against the test input sequence:

1. Test Input Sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
2. Test Output Sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Applying the transformation steps to the test input sequence:

1. Identifying small, isolated objects: There are multiple sets of consecutive 2's; however, none of them are fully surrounded by zeros, so no changes occur at this stage.
2. Finding nearest objects: Since no changes occurred in step 1, this step doesn't apply.
3. Calculating central index: As we didn't identify any relevant objects in step 1, this step does not apply.
4. Merging objects: No merges take place since no eligible objects were detected in step 1.
5. Maintaining color value: This step does not apply due to the lack of merges in step 4.
6. Removing isolated objects: Again, this step isn't necessary because there were no changes made.

Comparing the results:

Looking closely at the output sequence provided, it appears that some adjustments have been made differently than described by the transformation steps. Specifically, the first set of consecutive 2's (starting at position 2) has changed, although they do not form an isolated object. However, per the given description and transformation steps, only isolated objects should undergo alterations. Therefore, based on the given rules, the provided test output sequence seems incorrectly transformed compared to the expected result.

Answer:
{'test\_output\_analysis': 'It is observed that the transformation process deviated from the specified algorithm for certain parts of the input sequence. Additionally, objects were altered even though they weren’t entirely surrounded by zeros. Considering these discrepancies, I rate the test output as 1 out of 10.', 'value': 1}

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the provided transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence according to Step 1:

Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Isolated object: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2] (position 17-21)

Next, we follow Step 2 to find the nearest object of the same color to the left and right:

Nearest object to the left: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] (position 1-15)
Nearest object to the right: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2] (position 28-32)

Since both a left and right object were found, we proceed to Step 3, calculating the central index between these two objects:

Central Index = ((start\_index\_left + end\_index\_right)/2) - ((end\_index\_left - start\_index\_left)/2) = (1+28)/2 - (15-1)/2 = 17.5 - 7 = 10.5

However, since it is impossible to have a fractional index, this indicates that the isolated object does not qualify for merging based on the conditions described in Steps 1-4. This suggests an inconsistency with the given test output. Upon closer inspection, the test output has combined the isolated object with the correct neighboring objects; however, this cannot occur due to the conditions stated in the problem description. As a result, the test output contradicts the given rules.

Rating: 0 out of 10, because the test output fails to adhere to the specified rules and patterns.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation steps and the overall pattern.

1. In the test input sequence, we can identify small, isolated objects that meet the condition of being completely surrounded by zeros (example: the single 2 at position 38). So, Step 1 seems to be satisfied.
2. We don't see an explicit identification of neighboring objects in this test case, but based on the final result, it appears that the correct neighbors were considered (left neighbor at position 1 and right neighbor at position 37). Thus, Step 2 seems plausible.
3. Central index calculation is not explicitly shown, but assuming the correct neighbors were identified, calculating the central index would yield the expected outcome. Therefore, Step 3 might be valid.
4. For the isolated 2 at position 38, its start and end indices appear to be updated to match the calculated central index, connecting it with other objects containing the same color value. This implies that Steps 4 and 5 could be accurate. However, since the process is not shown explicitly, it's hard to confirm.
5. There seem to be no remaining isolated objects after the transformation. Since Step 6 doesn't apply to the current test case, it cannot be evaluated directly.

Given this evaluation, I would rate the test output a 7 out of 10. Although the results align with the provided overall pattern and most transformation steps, some crucial implementation details are missing, making it impossible to fully assess their accuracy.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, the objects always consist of continuous regions of identical non-zero color values, where smaller objects can be completely contained inside larger objects.
output: Across all output sequences, the objects consist of contiguous regions of identical non-zero color values, where each region contains exactly one original object without any gaps or overlaps.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they are smaller isolated regions of identical non-zero color values surrounded by zeros.
overall pattern: Small, isolated objects will combine with nearby objects of the same color when there is no other object of the same color between them. Combined objects maintain their color and increase in size while shifting to a central location between the initial objects.


transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence that meet the condition of being completely surrounded by zeros.', 'Step 2: For each identified object, find the nearest object of the same color to the left and right, if they exist.', 'Step 3: If both a left and right object are found, calculate the central index between these two objects.', 'Step 4: Merge the identified object with the neighboring objects by updating their respective start and end indices to match the calculated central index.', 'Step 5: Maintain the color value of the merged objects.', 'Step 6: Remove any remaining isolated objects that did not satisfy the merging criteria.']

input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we need to identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence (step 1). According to the condition mentioned in the overall pattern, such objects must be completely surrounded by zeros. In this case, there are two small, isolated objects: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2]. They are located at positions 7 to 10 and 21 to 24 in the input sequence.

Next, for each identified object, we must find the nearest object of the same color to the left and right, if they exist (step 2). Here, the first isolated object [2, 0, 0, 0, 2] has a matching object on the right side (position 38) but none on the left. Similarly, the second isolated object [2] does not have any matching objects on either side.

Since we cannot merge both isolated objects using the given rules, let's proceed with the ones having valid matches (step 3 and step 4). We calculate the central index between the matched objects on the right side of the first isolated object. In this case, it would be (10+38)/2 = 24. Then, update the start and end indices of the matched objects to match the calculated central index. After updating, the first isolated object becomes [2, 24, 24, 2, 2] while maintaining its color value (step 5).

Lastly, remove any remaining isolated objects that did not satisfy the merging criteria (step 6). This leaves us with the final sequence: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. By comparing this result with the given test output sequence, we notice discrepancies. Specifically, we see additional occurrences of the color 2 in positions 38 and beyond.

Therefore, based on our analysis, the test output sequence seems to be incorrectly transformed according to the provided transformation steps. A correct rating would be:

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the detailed transformation algorithm and analyzing whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence, the analysis reveals several inconsistencies in the process. Therefore, the test output cannot receive a high rating.', 'value': '3'}
------
 Based on the given information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the provided transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify small, isolated objects in the input sequence that meet the condition of being completely surrounded by zeros. In this case, the isolated object is [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Its leftmost non-zero element is at index 5, and its rightmost non-zero element is at index 10 (both inclusive). We then find the nearest object of the same color to the left and right, if they exist. Here, the nearest object to the left is a group of 2s starting at index 0, and the nearest object to the right is another group of 2s starting at index 27.

Next, we calculate the central index between these two objects to determine the merge point. The average of 0 and 27 is 13.5. Since we cannot have half-indices, we round up to get 14. This means the merged object would span from index 5 to index 14 (inclusive), resulting in [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]. However, the actual test output has extra zeros inserted after the merger, making it appear as [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]. This indicates that the transformation process may have been followed incorrectly during the merge step.

Rating: Based on the discrepancy observed in the test output, I would rate the test output as a 4 out of 10 due to improper merging of objects.
