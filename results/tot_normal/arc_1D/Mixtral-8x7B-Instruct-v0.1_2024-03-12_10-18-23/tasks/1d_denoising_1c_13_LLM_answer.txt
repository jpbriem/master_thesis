#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: All input sequences consist of one or two objects with no noise pixels. The objects may or may not be adjacent. If there are two objects, they will always be of the same color.
output: All output sequences consist of one object with no noise pixels. There is always exactly one object present in the output sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change depending on their spatial distribution and adjacency. Merging occurs when two objects of the same color are immediately adjacent, while splitting happens when a single object is separated by noise pixels.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, examine each pair of adjacent objects with identical colors. If found, merge them into a single object. Similarly, look for instances where a single object is divided by noise pixels; join them together in the output. This process ensures that the correct number of objects appears in the output, satisfying the specified transformation constraints.

        "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern provided does not precisely match the transformation in Example 1 since no merging or splitting occurs based on the given conditions.

Overall, the provided input-output pairs follow a consistent yet simple pattern of preserving the original object(s) without performing any merging or splitting. While the overall pattern attempts to explain these actions, it falls short by omitting crucial details about the conditions under which they should take place. Additionally, the pattern exhibits inconsistencies in applying its rules across different examples. Therefore, I assigned a value of 6 out of 10 to reflect my analyses.

description:
input: All input sequences consist of one or two objects with no noise pixels. The objects may or may not be adjacent. If there are two objects, they will always be of the same color.
output: All output sequences consist of one object with no noise pixels. There is always exactly one object present in the output sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their arrangement causes them to either disconnect or connect with other objects.

Specifically, objects change when:
1. They appear separately but close enough that they could combine into a single object.
2. They appear as a single connected object but far enough apart that they separate into multiple objects.
overall pattern: When objects appear to be too close or too far apart in the input, make adjustments so they consolidate into a single object or divide into multiple objects in the output.

To create the desired output sequence, follow these steps:
1. Identify all objects present in the input.
2. Evaluate whether the objects meet the criteria for merging or splitting.
3. Implement the necessary actions to modify the objects according to those criteria.

For example, if two objects are deemed too close and need to be merged, update their respective properties to reflect the combined shape of the resulting singular object.

Additionally, note that noise pixels never factor into the transformation process, as they are irrelevant to determining how objects relate to each other and subsequently behave.

In summary, the provided conditions and overall pattern effectively capture and guide the transformation shown in the examples. However, there are some potential issues related to generality and the lack of explicitness when addressing different object colors and varying distance thresholds. To increase the usability of these guidelines, consider refining the conditions and patterns by incorporating specific clarifications and general rules to handle diverse situations better.

 Here's the JSON response as requested:

```

This analysis suggests a moderate rating (6 out of 10) because although the provided conditions and overall patterns accurately capture the essence of the problem, they lack clear definitions—specifically around distance thresholds for merging or splitting objects. Providing concrete numerical thresholds rather than vague descriptors would improve the quality of the instructions, providing better guidance for implementing solutions.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change due to absorption caused by proximity of the same color objects.
overall pattern: Scan the input sequence left-to-right. When encountering two subsequent or separated objects of the same color, apply the absorb operation: remove the first object and increase the second object’s size to include the removed object. In case of separation, move to the new location of the second object before continuing scanning.

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The given overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output accurately for Example_1. The description says that when encountering two subsequent or separated objects of the same color, the first object gets removed and the size of the second object increases to include the removed object, which matches the observed behavior.",
    "precision_analysis": "Yes, the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output for Example_1.

  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the conditions hold true here as well – consisting of one or two objects with no noise pixels, and if there are two objects, they will always be of the same color.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The provided overall pattern fits Example_2 as well since we observe the removal of the first object followed by increasing the size of the next object upon encountering same-colored objects nearby, either separately or sequentially.",
    "precision_analysis": "Yes, the described pattern seems to be accurate enough to generate the correct output from any valid input based on Example_2. Similar concerns arise about handling multiple consecutive absorption opportunities.",

  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Confirmed - consistent with previous examples.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Matching Examples_1 and 2, the pattern works appropriately here too; we see that the same-colored object absorbs others near it, preserving just one unified object throughout the output.",
    "precision_analysis": "The precision remains sufficient for this example, but proper care should be taken during the implementation to ensure complete absorption.",
    "value": 9
  }
}

Overall, I assign a value of `9` out of `10`, because even though the rules seem clear and applicable, their practical application depends on meticulous coding to handle potential challenges like ensuring that every opportunity for absorption is identified in the input.

 Here is the JSON response to your request:

These conditions accurately describe the input sequence in this example. However, the condition about the objects being of the same color is not necessary for the transformation pattern.",
        "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern provided seems to correctly describe the transformation from input to output. It involves scanning the input sequence from left to right, detecting subsequent or separated objects of the same color, and applying an 'absorb' operation to merge them.

Overall, I would rate the quality of the conditions and the overall pattern at 8 out of 10. While the conditions do describe the examples well, they could be improved by removing unnecessary requirements such as the objects having to be the same color. The overall pattern also successfully explains the transformation process, but it lacks precision in some areas, particularly around handling multiple consecutive objects of the same color.#############################

description:
input: Across all input sequences, there is always exactly one object. This object may be split into multiple smaller objects in the output sequence.
output: Output sequences either contain no objects (consisting entirely of noise pixels), or contain one or more objects that are subsets of the original object(s) in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: If there is one object in the input sequence, it will maintain its color in the output sequence. If the input object spans across an even number of cells, then the resulting number of objects in the output sequence will be two. Otherwise, the number of objects in the output sequence will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to N/2 where N is the number of non-background cells occupied by the input object.
overall pattern: For every input sequence containing one object, create output objects by checking the parity of the total cells occupied by the input object. If the number of cells is odd, divide the object into two roughly equal halves. If the number of cells is even, check if dividing the object equally results in an additional noise pixel (i.e., when the length is divisible by four). In this case, eliminate the additional noise pixel. When the object is divided, place the output objects accordingly using the information about their relative positions derived from the input object.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, there is always exactly one object. This object may be split into multiple smaller objects in the output sequence.
output: Output sequences either contain no objects (consisting entirely of noise pixels), or contain one or more objects that are subsets of the original object(s) in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: The main condition governing changes in objects appears to relate to the size of the input object. When an input object covers a wide range of indices, it tends to break apart into many smaller objects in the output.
overall pattern: To summarize, there are three main types of transformations applied to objects depending on their size: 1) Small objects (less than ~10 indices) remain unchanged; 2) Medium-sized objects (between ~10 and ~20 indices) may merge with neighboring objects of the same color; and 3) Large objects (greater than ~20 indices) break apart into smaller objects. However, the specific outcomes depend on factors like adjacency and color matching, making it challenging to provide precise rules. It would require further investigation and testing to establish more detailed patterns and conditions guiding the object transformations.

In summary, we rate the information and patterns provided as `3` out of 10 due to insufficient clarification on the rules governing the transformation from input to output. A value closer to 10 would require detailed explanations covering aspects such as splitting or merging rules, location variations, and other factors influencing the relationships between consecutive frames.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, there is always exactly one object. This object may be split into multiple smaller objects in the output sequence.
output: Output sequences either contain no objects (consisting entirely of noise pixels), or contain one or more objects that are subsets of the original object(s) in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence of noise pixels before, after, or between parts of the input object determines the distribution of objects in the output sequence.

        "1. Identify the starting and ending indices of the object in the input sequence.",
        "2. Iterate over the input sequence from left to right, keeping track of the current run of noise pixels.",

```
Explanation:
First, we identify the starting and ending indices of the object in the input sequence. Then, we iterate over the input sequence from left to right while keeping track of the current run of noise pixels. When we encounter a non-noise pixel, we check if it belongs to the input object. If it does, we continue iterating over the sequence until reaching the end of the input object. Otherwise, we create a new object in the output sequence consisting of this contiguous block of noise pixels. We repeat this process until the end of the input sequence is reached. Finally, if the last object in the input sequence ends with noise pixels, we treat them as a separate object in the output sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change due to absorption caused by proximity of the same color objects.
overall pattern: Scan the input sequence left-to-right. When encountering two subsequent or separated objects of the same color, apply the absorb operation: remove the first object and increase the second object’s size to include the removed object. In case of separation, move to the new location of the second object before continuing scanning.

description:
input: All input sequences consist of one or two objects with no noise pixels. The objects may or may not be adjacent. If there are two objects, they will always be of the same color.
output: All output sequences consist of one object with no noise pixels. There is always exactly one object present in the output sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change due to absorption caused by proximity of the same color objects.
overall pattern: Scan the input sequence left-to-right. When encountering two subsequent or separated objects of the same color, apply the absorb operation: remove the first object and increase the second object’s size to include the removed object. In case of separation, move to the new location of the second object before continuing scanning.



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence from left to right.', 'If the current pixel is not background color (0), it starts a new object or extends the existing object.', 'Set initial properties for the new object: color = current pixel value, start_index = current index, end_index = current index, size = 1.', 'If the next pixel is also part of the same object (same color), update the end_index and size of the current object.', "If the next pixel is a different color or background color (0), check if there's another object of the same color ahead:", "If so, perform 'absorb' operation: remove the earlier object (update input sequence) and increase the size of the later object to include the absorbed pixels.", 'Move the scanning position to the end_index of the later object.', 'Repeat steps 4-7 until reaching the end of the input sequence.']

Value Outputs:
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps:

* Example\_1:
	+ Transformation analysis: The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. The absorption operation is not triggered because there are no two subsequent or separated objects of the same color.
	+ Value: 10
* Example\_2:
	+ Transformation analysis: The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. The absorption operation is triggered when the scanning position encounters two separated objects of the same color (7). The first object is removed and the second object increases its size to include the absorbed pixels.
	+ Value: 10
* Example\_3:
	+ Transformation analysis: The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. The absorption operation is triggered twice. First, when the scanning position encounters two subsequent objects of the same color (8), and second when it encounters two separated objects of the same color (8). Both times, the absorption operation removes the earlier object and increases the size of the later object to include the absorbed pixels.
	+ Value: 10

Overall, the transformation steps accurately describe how to transform the input sequences into their respective output sequences based on the provided description and overall pattern. However, it would be beneficial to add a step after the absorption operation to ensure the scanning position moves to the end\_index of the later object, as mentioned in step 6. Additionally, consider adding a final step to handle cases where the last object does not require absorption but still needs its end\_index updated to match the last non-background pixel in the input sequence.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, there is always exactly one object. This object may be split into multiple smaller objects in the output sequence.
output: Output sequences either contain no objects (consisting entirely of noise pixels), or contain one or more objects that are subsets of the original object(s) in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence of noise pixels before, after, or between parts of the input object determines the distribution of objects in the output sequence.
overall pattern: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output. If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.


transformation steps: ['Step 1: Iterate through the input sequence and identify the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence.', 'Step 2: Identify any blocks of noise pixels (consecutive zeros) within this object, including at the beginning and end of the object.', 'Step 3: For each block of noise pixels identified, extract the subsequence of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels.', 'Step 4: Create a new object in the output sequence using these extracted noise pixels.', 'Step 5: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until all blocks of noise pixels within the input object have been processed.', 'Step 6: If the input object ended with noise pixels, ensure they are treated as separate objects in the output sequence.']

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the test input sequence using the given transformation steps.

1. In Step 1, we need to find the starting and ending indices of the object in the input sequence. Here, the object is represented by color 2, so the object ranges from index 4 to 29 in the input sequence.
2. Next, in Step 2, we look for blocks of noise pixels within the object. We can see three blocks of consecutive zeros: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 0].
3. Now, according to Step 3 and 4, we should process each block of noise pixels separately. However, when looking closely at both the input and output sequences, it seems like the first two blocks were merged into a single object instead of being kept separate as required by the overall pattern.
	* Block 1 (indices 0-3): Should result in four individual 0s in the output sequence, but instead, it's treated as part of the initial object.
	* Block 2 (indices 22-24): These should be separate from the long sequence of 2s since they follow another block of noise pixels, but they're included in the final object spanning from index 16 to 28 in the output sequence.
4. For Step 5, we verify whether all blocks of noise pixels have been processed correctly. As mentioned earlier, the first two blocks of noise pixels weren't processed independently. So, the answer would be "no" for this step.
5. Finally, in Step 6, we check if the input object ends with noise pixels and if they are treated as separate objects in the output sequence. Since we already found issues in previous steps, we cannot proceed with evaluating this step without addressing the problems encountered earlier.

To summarize our findings, there seem to be inconsistencies with processing blocks of noise pixels within the main object according to the given rules, particularly regarding the separation of distinct blocks of noise pixels. Thus, the test output sequence does not appear to correctly apply the specified transformation to the test input sequence.

As a result, the JSON response will be constructed as follows:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
    "value": 3
}
```

A rating of 3 indicates significant deviations from the expected transformation results based on the observed discrepancies in applying the rules.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation steps:

1. Identify the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence.
   - In the test input, the single object starts at index 4 and ends at index 29.
2. Identify any blocks of noise pixels (consecutive zeros) within this object, including at the beginning and end of the object.
   - There are three blocks of noise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0] at the beginning, [0, 0, 0] at the end, and [0, 2, 0, 2] inside the object.
3. For each block of noise pixels identified, extract the subsequence of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels.
   - Extracted subsequences: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 2].
4. Create a new object in the output sequence using these extracted noise pixels.
   - Created objects: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 2].

Now let's compare the test output sequence with the expected result based on the transformation steps:

Test output:     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Expected output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Comparing the two sequences reveals that the first and last blocks of noise pixels were handled correctly. However, the inner block of consecutive zeros ([0, 2]) was incorrectly separated from the neighboring colored pixels. Instead, it should have remained part of the previous colored pixel sequence. Therefore, the current implementation does not follow Step 6 accurately in handling the case where the input object ends with noise pixels.

As a consequence, I would rate the test output quality as 6 out of 10, considering the correct treatment of most noise pixel blocks but the failure to adhere strictly to the specified pattern in one instance.

Value Outputs:
 To evaluate the given test output sequence, we will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Based on our analysis, we will provide a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as an integer.

1. Step 1: In the input sequence, the single object starts at index 4 and ends at index 29, which matches the first appearance of digit 2 till its last appearance.
2. Step 2: There are two blocks of noise pixels within the object: indices 0-3 (before the object), indices 30-32 (after the object), and indices 10-11 and 27-28 (between parts of the object).
3. Step 3 & 4: The first block of noise pixels results in creating a noise object [0, 0, 0, 0]. The second block of noise pixels does not result in a new object since it's part of the already existing noise at the tail of the input object. However, per Step 6, this should be considered separately. So, additional noise objects created are [0, 0] and [0].
4. Combining the non-noise portions of the input object, three distinct objects remain: [2, 2, 2], [2], and [2].
5. Comparing the expected output and obtained output shows correspondence for non-noise portions; however, the noise objects seem misrepresented. Instead of an array representation, they are individual numbers. It seems like a serialization issue when converting NumPy arrays to JSON format.

To overcome this problem, let's convert the NumPy arrays to lists before returning the JSON object.

```python
import numpy as np

def convert_numpy_to_list(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, np.ndarray):
        return obj.tolist()
    elif isinstance(obj, dict):
        return {k: convert_numpy_to_list(v) for k, v in obj.items()}
    elif isinstance(obj, list):
        return [convert_numpy_to_list(o) for o in obj]
    else:
        return obj

result = {'test_output_analysis': 'See points above', 'value': 8}
return convert_numpy_to_list(result)
```

With this change, our evaluation returns the desired output considering all the steps in the transformation process.

Output: `{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 8}`
------
 To evaluate the given test output sequence, we will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

1. In Step 1, the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence must be identified. In the test case, the object starts at index 4 and ends at index 28. Since the entire algorithm depends on accurately identifying the object, it's crucial to confirm that the correct indices were found. It appears that the object has been correctly identified.
2. Step 2 requires us to identify blocks of noise pixels within the object, including at the beginning and end. We can see that there are three blocks of noise pixels in the test case: [0, 0, 0] at the beginning of the object, another [0, 0] block towards the middle, and finally [0, 0] at the end.
3. Step 3 directs us to extract subsequences of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels for each block of noise pixels identified. Based on our understanding of the previous steps, the extraction process seems to be accurate; however, without explicit confirmation in the problem statement, we cannot say for certain.
4. Step 4 instructs creating a new object in the output sequence using the extracted noise pixels for each block identified. Here are the expected new objects based on the problem description:
   - Noise Pixel Block 1: [0, 0, 0]
   - Noise Pixel Block 2: [0, 0]
   - Noise Pixel Block 3: [0, 0]
5. Comparing the output provided against the expected new objects in Step 4:
   - Noise Pixel Block 1: Matches the first element in the output array: [array([0, 0, 0])].
   - Noise Pixel Block 2: Missing in the output. However, since Step 6 instructs treating ending noise pixels separately, let's examine this further.
   - Noise Pixel Block 3: Matches the last element in the output array: [array([2]), array([0, 0])]. Although the second-to-last element contains [2], which doesn't match the exact noise pixel block, considering Step 6, this might still be considered valid.
6. Examining Step 6, ending noise pixels need to be treated as separate objects in the output sequence. In the test case, since the third noise pixel block consists of two pixels instead of one, it could be argued that both noise pixels should be separated into their own arrays. However, there isn't enough information in the problem statement to make a definitive decision regarding the validity of merging consecutive noise pixels during this final step.

Given the ambiguity in handling consecutive noise pixels at the very end of the input object, we cannot provide a definite rating. Instead, we recommend reviewing Step 6 and clarifying how to handle such cases by explicitly stating whether to merge consecutive noise pixels or keep them separate. With that clarification, a proper rating would be determined.

{
  'test\_output\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Given the ambiguity in handling consecutive noise pixels at the end of the input object, a definite rating cannot be provided without further clarification on whether to merge consecutive noise pixels or keep them separate.',

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps. We will go through each step and determine whether it has been correctly applied to the test input sequence.

1. Identify the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence: In our test case, the object starts at index 4 and ends at index 29.
2. Identify any blocks of noise pixels (consecutive zeros) within this object, including at the beginning and end of the object: There are three blocks of noise pixels - indices [0, 3], [30, 33], and [34, 37].
3. For each block of noise pixels identified, extract the subsequence of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels: Subsequences are as follows [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 0, 0, 0].
4. Create a new object in the output sequence using these extracted noise pixels: New objects are created based on these subsequences; however, we observe that some consecutive noise pixels were merged in the output sequence (e.g., first two subsequences). This contradicts the expected output.

Given the discrepancy found during Step 4, the given test output cannot be confirmed as correct according to the transformation pattern and steps. To provide additional context, I would recommend providing a numeric value reflecting the quality of the result. Considering our findings, I suggest giving a lower score on the range of 0-10 indicating insufficient adherence to the specified rules due to merging noise pixels during the creation of objects in the output sequence:

{'test_output_analysis': 'The test input sequence appears to have been partially incorrectly transformed into its test output sequence. Specifically, when creating new objects in the output sequence using extracted noise pixels, the resulting output combined consecutive noise pixels instead of treating them as separate objects as required by the given transformation pattern.', 'value': '3'}
------
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output sequence:

The test input sequence contains one object with color 2, which is split into two objects in the test output sequence. This matches the description and overall pattern provided.

Let's go through the transformation steps:

Step 1: The starting index of the object is 4 and the ending index is 27.
Step 2: There are three blocks of noise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0] at the beginning, [0, 0] at the end, and [0, 0] between the two parts of the object.
Step 3 & 4: A new object is created for each block of noise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0], [], and [0, 0].
Step 5: All blocks of noise pixels have been processed.
Step 6: The noise pixels at the end of the object are treated as a separate object in the output sequence.

Based on this analysis, the test output sequence seems to be correct. However, it's important to note that the second object in the test output sequence is empty. Depending on the specific requirements of the task, this might or might not be acceptable.

Therefore, I would rate the test output as follows:

{'test_output_analysis': 'The test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence according to the specified transformation steps. Note that the second object in the output sequence is empty.', 'value': '9'}

Value Outputs:
 To evaluate the test output sequence, we will consider each step of the provided transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

1. **Iterate through the input sequence and identify the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence.**
   In the test input sequence, the object starts at index 4 and ends at index 30.
2. **Identify any blocks of noise pixels (consecutive zeros) within this object, including at the beginning and end of the object.**
   There are three blocks of noise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0] at the beginning, [0, 0] at the end, and another [0, 0] at index 10.
3. **For each block of noise pixels identified, extract the subsequence of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels.**
   Block 1: [0, 0, 0, 0]; Block 2: [0, 0]; Block 3: [0, 0].
4. **Create a new object in the output sequence using these extracted noise pixels.**
   After applying step 4, the output would look like this: [0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 2]. However, this does not match the test output sequence.

Since the test output sequence does not follow Step 4, it seems there might be an issue with treating consecutive zeros as separate objects. Alternatively, it's also possible that further steps were applied but not specified. Based on our current understanding of the provided instructions, however, we cannot confirm whether additional unspecified steps led to the test output sequence. Regardless, the test output sequence contradicts Step 4 of the transformation process. Therefore, we must rate the accuracy of the test output sequence low.

Output JSON:
{
  'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Based on the current evaluation, the test output sequence appears to contradict Step 4 of the transformation process by treating some consecutive zeros as non-separate objects.',
  'value': '3'
}
------
 To evaluate the given test output sequence, we will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

1. **Iterate through the input sequence and identify the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence.**

In the test case, the object starts at index 4 (with value 2) and ends at index 29 (also value 2).

2. **Identify any blocks of noise pixels (consecutive zeros) within this object, including at the beginning and end of the object.**

Within the object, the blocks of noise pixels are found at indices [0, 4), [29, 30), and inside the object at indices [18, 22).

3. **For each block of noise pixels identified, extract the subsequence of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels.**

The three blocks of noise pixels are: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0], and [0, 0, 0].

4. **Create a new object in the output sequence using these extracted noise pixels.**

This step doesn't seem to apply here, since there are no specific instructions about how to incorporate the extracted noise pixels back to the output sequence. However, it seems reasonable to assume that these noise pixels should form their own objects in the output sequence based on the problem description. Incorporating this assumption, the first four noise pixels create their own object in the output sequence.

5. **Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until all blocks of noise pixels within the input object have been processed.**

Following our assumption from Step 4, we would process the rest of the noise pixels accordingly. That leaves us with two additional noise pixel blocks being incorporated into the output sequence.

6. **If the input object ended with noise pixels, ensure they are treated as separate objects in the output sequence.**

Since the last non-noise pixel has the same value as the previous noise pixel block, we can treat the noise pixel block immediately preceding the final non-zero element as a separate object. Therefore, it requires an individual evaluation.

Based on the provided information and the assumptions made during the analysis, the expected output sequence for the test case would look like this:

`[0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0]`

However, the actual test output sequence differs from the expected one. Thus, the transformation appears to have not been applied correctly in this instance.

To summarize, based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer:

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering the transformation algorithm steps and making some necessary assumptions, the test output does not follow the correct pattern. Specifically, the extraction and processing of noise pixels don't appear to have been performed accurately, resulting in an incorrect distribution of objects in the output sequence.', 'value': '3'}#############################

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s). In this case, the noise pixels are located at the beginning, between the first two groups of 2s, and at the end of the input sequence.

Next, for each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, we create a new object containing just those pixels in the output. However, in the test output, we see that the first group of three zeros has been combined with the second group of three zeros. This violates the overall pattern described earlier, as these should be treated as separate blocks of noise pixels and therefore separate objects in the output.

Lastly, if an object ends with noise pixels, we treat them as separate objects in the output. In the test output, we can see that the last group of five twos has been followed by a single zero, but this zero has not been treated as a separate object.

Therefore, based on our analysis, we cannot say that the test output was obtained by applying the transformation correctly to the test input sequence. We would rate the accuracy of the test output as a 3 out of 10, as some aspects of the transformation were applied correctly, such as identifying the location of noise pixels and creating new objects for some blocks of noise pixels. However, the failure to properly distinguish between adjacent blocks of noise pixels significantly detracts from the quality of the output.

Output:

"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",

}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the test input sequence. We will consider each transformation step and check whether it has been correctly applied.

Step 1: Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).
In this particular test case, noise pixels are present at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28. The input object starts at index 4 and ends at index 20. All noise pixels have been correctly identified.

Step 2: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.
This step seems to have issues in the test output. In the actual output, four blocks of noise pixels are converted into objects; however, they do not correspond to any contiguous blocks found within the input object. Instead, these blocks seem arbitrary and don't match our expected result based on the description and overall pattern.

Step 3: If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.
There isn't any clear application of this rule in the test output. It might require revisiting Step 2 properly, but since Step 2 contains errors, we cannot proceed to evaluating this specific step.

Overall, it appears that the transformation procedure hasn't been followed accurately while generating the test output. Specifically, the conversion of noise pixel blocks to objects in the output needs improvement. To ensure accurate results, kindly review this process and revise the test output accordingly.

To summarize, here is the JSON response:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
  "value": 3
}

A value of 3 indicates a low level of compliance with the correct transformation rules based on the given description, overall pattern, and transformation steps.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given input-output pairs and the description, overall pattern, and transformation steps provided, we can evaluate the correctness of the test output sequence.

First, let's identify the input object and noise pixels in the test input sequence:

Input Object: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2]
Noise Pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, let's apply each transformation step to the test input sequence:

Step 1: Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).
- In this case, the noise pixels are located at the beginning, end, and between some parts of the input object.

Step 2: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.
- There are no contiguous blocks of noise pixels within the input object, so this step does not change the sequence.

Step 3: If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.
- In this case, the last part of the input object has noise pixels surrounding it, but they cannot be treated as separate objects since they are connected to other parts of the input object. Therefore, this step doesn't affect the sequence either.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the test output sequence follows the expected pattern. However, we notice that the first few zeros in the output seem unusual because the initial noise pixels aren't grouped together as their own object. To ensure the correctness of the result, further clarification might be needed regarding how to handle leading noise pixels when they're isolated.

However, based on the information provided, we will rate the test output as:

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the given transformation steps, the test input sequence seems to have been correctly transformed into its test output sequence. But please note that there might be ambiguity in handling leading isolated noise pixels.', 'value': '8'}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the expected transformation patterns. We will go through each transformation step to determine whether the test output matches the expected results.

Transformation Step 1: Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).

Looking at the test input, the noise pixels are located at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33. These correspond to areas outside the object and some trailing pixels in the object.

Transformation Step 2: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.

In this case, we don't see any blocks of noise pixels inside the main object itself; the noise pixels are mostly found before and after the object, except for an isolated section at position 14. Since there aren't any contiguous blocks of noise pixels within the input object, this rule doesn't apply here.

Transformation Step 3: If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.

Here, the last few elements of the object, starting from position 26, include noise pixels. According to the given rules, these should be treated as separate objects in the output. However, in the test output, they appear to be part of a single continuous object.

Given our analysis, it seems like the test output does not fully adhere to the specified transformation steps. It appears that the algorithm did not treat the final portion of the object properly as separate objects due to the existence of trailing noise pixels. Thus, based on this analysis, I would rate the accuracy of the test output sequence as a 5 out of 10 regarding correct application of the transformation.

Please consider revising the implementation according to the described transformation steps to ensure proper handling of all cases involving noise pixels related to objects in the input sequence.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence by considering each step of the transformation algorithm.

Step 1: Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).
In the test input sequence, noise pixels are present at positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 25, 26, 27, 46, 47, 48, and 49.

Step 2: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.
In this step, we need to identify blocks of noise pixels that are part of the input object. These blocks are found at positions:
- Block 1: [5, 6]
- Block 2: [25, 26, 27]

Accordingly, these blocks become separate objects in the output:
- [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
- [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 3: If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.
In the test output sequence, there are two instances where this applies:
- Instance 1: Position [34]: Since it follows an object of value 2 and has no other adjacent object, it becomes a separate object of value 0.
- Instance 2: Positions [35 - 45]: Since they follow another object of value 2 and have no other adjacent object, they become separate objects of value 0.

Now, let us rate the transformation based on the correctness of applying transformation rules and consistency in handling edge cases:

We observe some discrepancies in the test output sequence compared to the expected result:
1. In the first block of noise pixels, the trailing zeros were extended beyond their actual length, whereas the rule suggests creating a new object only for the contiguous block of noise pixels.
2. Additional objects were introduced at the end of the sequence without any apparent reason, since there are no noise pixels present there in the input sequence.
3. There seems to be inconsistency in treating isolated noise pixels. While the rule implies that they should form part of a larger object that contains the noise pixels, here they appear as standalone objects.

Taking these points into consideration, I would rate the quality of the transformation as 3 out of 10, due to several deviations from the suggested rules and lack of consistency in handling edge cases.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify the locations of noise pixels relative to the input object(s):

Input = [0, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0]

Next, for each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, we create a new object containing just those pixels in the output:

Output = [0, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, **0**, **0**, **0**, **2**, 0, 0, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**]

We can see that the first part of the input object has been separated by noise pixels correctly in the output. However, when looking at the second occurrence of the object, it appears that the transformation wasn't performed according to the rules provided. Instead of creating two separate objects at the end of the initial object, they were merged together, resulting in the wrong output.

It seems like this particular output missed the last step of the transformation process:

"If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output."

Therefore, I cannot consider the test output correct based on the given description, patterns, and transformation steps.

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was not correctly transformed into its test output sequence. There's an inconsistency with treating noise pixels at the end of an object.', 'value': '3'}

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify the location of noise pixels (0s) relative to the non-noise pixels (2s) in the input sequence. We can see multiple blocks of noise pixels before, between, and after the main body of the input object.

Next, we apply the second transformation step: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output. Here, we observe several issues with the test output sequence:

1. At the beginning of the sequence, although there are noise pixels, they do not form their own object in the output. Instead, a `1` is inserted at the beginning of the sequence creating an incorrect object.
2. After the first section of the input object (non-noise pixels), instead of inserting a single `1`, two `1`s are inserted, again forming an incorrect object.
3. Towards the end of the sequence, the last group of non-noise pixels does not have any trailing noise pixels left untouched. According to step 3, these should be considered separate objects; however, this is not reflected in the test output.

Considering these discrepancies, it appears that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input sequence.

Output:
{'test_output_analysis': 'Noise pixels at the beginning and middle of the input sequence were not separated into distinct objects, and the final segment of non-noise pixels did not have proper separation based on trailing noise pixels.', 'value': '4'}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we will identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s):

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
Noise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Objects: [[2, 6, 16, 30]]

Now, for each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, we create a new object containing just those pixels in the output:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]
New objects created from noise blocks: []

Finally, if an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output:

In this example, objects do not end with noise pixels, so this step does not apply.

From our evaluation, it appears that most of the transformation steps were followed correctly; however, we notice that the first two '2's are isolated at position 6 and 8, while they should belong to the same object according to the transformation rules. Therefore, the correct output would look like this: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1].

Based on this observation, we rate the test output as value: 7 out of 10.
