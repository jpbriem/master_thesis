For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all input sequences, there are always two main types of elements - objects and background. These objects may appear in various shapes and forms with possible isolated noise pixels present occasionally. Isolated noise pixels do not seem to affect any alterations made to objects during the transformation process.\noutput: Output sequences consistently showcase three distinct types of objects - original objects, transformed objects, and background. Transformed objects typically follow a specific distance from one another before being altered, while isolated noise pixels seem unaffected by this transformation process.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change color based on whether they belong to groups of certain sizes (group size = 1 leads to no change). This condition applies to color 2 objects only.\noverall pattern: For each object in the input, check the group size of color 2 objects including itself. If the group size is greater than 2, change the color to 6; otherwise, keep the color unchanged. Position and size remain unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Step 1: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence.', \"Step 2: Identify the current pixel's color and its neighbors' colors.\", 'Step 3: Check if the current pixel has color 2 and if it is part of a group with a group size greater than 2, considering neighboring pixels as part of the group.', 'Step 4: If the pixel is part of a qualifying group, change its color to 6 while preserving the position and size of the object.', 'Step 5: If the pixel does not meet the condition, maintain its original color.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, let's evaluate the test input sequence and its corresponding test output sequence:\",\n\"value\": 10}\n\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence.\n- Passed, since we can see that every pixel in both the input and output sequences is evaluated.\n\nStep 2: Identify the current pixel's color and its neighbors' colors.\n- Passed, since the input and output sequences indicate correct identification and manipulation of neighboring colors.\n\nStep 3: Check if the current pixel has color 2 and if it is part of a group with a group size greater than 2, considering neighboring pixels as part of the group.\n- Passed, since the output sequence shows proper handling of groups with color 2.\n\nStep 4: If the pixel is part of a qualifying group, change its color to 6 while preserving the position and size of the object.\n- Passed, since the output sequence shows that pixels with color 2 were changed to color 6 when belonging to a group of appropriate size. Additionally, their positions and sizes remained unchanged.\n\nStep 5: If the pixel does not meet the condition, maintain its original color.\n- Passed, since non-qualifying pixels retained their original color.\n\nTherefore, the provided test output passes our evaluation criteria, so I rate it 10 out of 10.\n------\n {\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Considering each step of the transformation algorithm:\\n\\nStep 1: The test input sequence appears to be iterated through correctly.\\nStep 2: Neighboring colors are accurately identified throughout the sequence.\\nStep 3: Color 2 pixels that are part of a group with a group size greater than 2 are successfully identified.\\nStep 4: The color of these qualified pixels is changed to 6, while their positions and sizes remain unchanged.\\nStep 5: Non-qualified pixels maintain their original color.\\n\\nOverall, the test input sequence seems to be correctly transformed into its output sequence according to the provided transformation pattern and steps.\", \"value\": 10}"
