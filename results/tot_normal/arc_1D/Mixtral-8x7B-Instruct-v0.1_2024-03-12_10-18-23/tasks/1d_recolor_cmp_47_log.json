The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Both objects can appear multiple times throughout the sequence, sometimes fragmented by noise pixels.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]\noutput: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all inputs, there exist two distinct objects: object_5 and object_0. Both objects can appear multiple times throughout the sequence, sometimes fragmented by noise pixels. There does not seem to be any consistent rule governing their placement or interaction with each other.\noutput: Despite inconsistencies observed across various outputs, one recurring theme emerges: the introduction of a third object type, denoted as object_8, which selectively replaces certain occurrences of object_5. Although the exact conditions triggering these replacements remain unclear, it is evident that they significantly alter the appearance of the final output sequences.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change under the condition where consecutive object_5 pixels are found. When this condition applies, object_5 gets transformed into object_8 while maintaining the original position and size. Other instances of object_5 stay unaltered.\noverall pattern: To transform input into the desired output, search for successive occurrences of object_5 and replace them with object_8 in the same location and size. Leave other instances of object_5 intact.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'For each object in the sequence, check if it is object_5 and if it appears consecutively with another object_5', 'If an object_5 is found to be consecutive with another object_5, mark its starting and ending indices', 'Replace the marked region of consecutive object_5s with object_8, preserving the original position and size', 'Leave other instances of object_5 unchanged']\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\n\"Example_1\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify and replace consecutive object_5s with object_8, preserving the original position and size, resulting in a rating of 10 for the transformation steps.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n},\n\"Example_2\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, the transformation steps accurately detect and substitute consecutive object_5s with object_8 in this case too, earning a perfect score of 10 for the transformation steps.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n},\n\"Example_3\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"Despite slight variations compared to previous examples, the transformation steps still effectively recognize and replace consecutive object_5s with object_8 without affecting non-consecutive ones, yielding a rating of 10 for the transformation steps.\"\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n}\n------\n {\n\"Example\\_1\": {\n\"transformation\\_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

Therefore, I would rate the test output as 10.\n------\n Based on the given information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the provided transformation steps:\n\n1. Identify all objects with color 5 in the input sequence.\n   - In the test input sequence, we can identify the following objects with color 5:\n     ```\n     Object_1: {color: 5, start_index: 3, end_index: 5, size: 3}\n     Object_2: {color: 5, start_index: 10, end_index: 12, size: 3}\n     Object_3: {color: 5, start_index: 13, end_index: 16, size: 4}\n     Object_4: {color: 5, start_index: 22, end_index: 23, size: 2}\n     Object_5: {color: 5, start_index: 27, end_index: 28, size: 2}\n     ```\n\n2. Check if each object with color 5 is adjacent to at least two other objects with color 5.\n   - Object_1 is adjacent to 0 objects with color 5.\n   - Object_2 is adjacent to Object_1 (size=3) and another object with color 5 (total = 2).\n   - Object_3 is adjacent to Object_2 (size=3), itself, and Object_4 (size=4) -- total of 3 other objects with color 5.\n   - Object_4 is adjacent to Object_3 (size=4) -- total of 1 other object with color 5.\n   - Object_5 is adjacent to 0 objects with color 5.\n\n3. If an object with color 5 meets the condition, replace it with an object with color 8 in the output sequence.\n   - Replace Object_2 with an object with color 8 since it's adjacent to 2 other objects with color 5.\n   - Replace Object_3 with an object with color 8 since it's adjacent to 3 other objects with color 5.\n   - Keep Object_1 and Object_5 as they are because they aren't adjacent to enough objects with color 5.\n\n4. Otherwise, maintain the original object in the output sequence without any changes.\n   - We already took care of this in step 3.\n\nBased on the evaluation above, the test output sequence seems to follow the correct transformation process. However, note that I cannot provide a concrete numerical value as requested due to the lack of context regarding what constitutes a \"good\" or \"bad\" transformation. A human evaluator would need to determine whether the resulting output falls within an acceptable range of quality.
