#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given input description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other inputs.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given output description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other outputs.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

        "output_analysis": "The output description also does not provide any specific information.

```
Please note that I have omitted the repetition of the `input_analysis` and `output_analysis` sections for brevity, and you would need to complete them similarly to the Analysis section in Example\_1 above according to the patterns observed in Examples\_2 and 3.

As for the `value` field, after analyzing all three examples, you may assign a score based on the quality and completeness of the descriptions. In my opinion, despite not capturing the full pattern, the descriptions do still convey some useful information about the problem domain and can serve as a starting point for understanding. Therefore, I assigned a relatively high rating (7 out of 10). Of course, you might choose to adjust these ratings based on more detailed considerations and requirements.

 Here is the JSON object that contains the requested analysis:

```json
{
    "Example_1": {
        "input_analysis": "The input description does not provide specific information about the relationship between the original pixel values and the resulting output values. However, it accurately describes the structure of adjacent identical pixel values grouped together and separated by zeros. It also captures the varying sizes of these groups.",
        "output_analysis": "The output description correctly identifies that for each distinct color value in the input, there will be a single corresponding color value in the output. This correspondence appears to maintain the relative positions and sizes of the connected components in the input image. However, the description does not specify how the mapping between input colors and output colors is determined.",
        "value": "7"

        "output_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
        "value": "7"
    }
}
```

In summary, both input and output descriptions capture important properties like relative positions, sizes, and connectivity of colored regions in the images. However, neither provides a clear explanation of how the mapping between input color values and output color values occurs.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects with color 1 consistently appear in groups, separated by noise pixels (0). Each group can be considered an unbroken chain of consecutive pixels with the same value. This suggests that the underlying rule may involve identifying connected components or segments of like-colored pixels.
output: Across all output sequences, new objects with color 6 replace the locations where objects with color 1 were present in the input sequences. Therefore, it seems plausible that the underlying rule is related to replacing specific objects with another object while preserving their spatial relationships.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of groups of consecutive 1s of varying sizes, ranging from 1 to 7. In some cases, multiple objects may appear in the input sequence.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always exactly one object, consisting of a group of consecutive 6s, replacing the original groups of 1s in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their color (from 1 to 6), with no apparent dependence on their position, size, or other factors. This suggests that the color change is likely conditioned by the presence of an object with color 1 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, search for objects with color 1. Transform them into a single object with color 6, preserving the starting and ending indices from the input. Note that overlapping objects will be merged into a single object during this process, ensuring that there is always only one object in the output.

Overall, the given pattern accurately describes the relationship between the input and output sequences. However, I notice that the precision\_analysis value is set to 9 instead of 10 because the given pattern assumes that the object being transformed has a color value of 1. If the input sequence contains objects with a different color value, then the given pattern would need to be adjusted accordingly.

description:

output: Across all output sequences, there is always exactly one object, consisting of a group of consecutive 6s, replacing the original groups of 1s in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects undergo modification when they are surrounded by zeros on both sides. Individual isolated 1s without any zeros around them do not change during the transformation.
overall pattern: To apply the transformation, iterate through the input sequence searching for connected groups of 1s, considering their location and neighboring elements. Replace each group of 1s enclosed by zeros with the corresponding group of 6s. Maintain the size, position, and color of non-transformed objects in the output for consistency.

Explanation:
1. Scan the input sequence to locate individual groups of 1s.
2. For each group of 1s, check whether it is encircled by zeros.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of groups of consecutive 1s of varying sizes, ranging from 1 to 7. In some cases, multiple objects may appear in the input sequence.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always exactly one object, consisting of a group of consecutive 6s, replacing the original groups of 1s in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when there are groups of 1s in the input, regardless of their size or position.
overall pattern: For any given input, search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0). Replace every such sequence at once with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input. This results in a consistent mapping between input and output objects across all examples.

output: Across all output sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (6 or 1). The number of objects decreases by one compared to the input.

overall pattern:
conditions: A decrease in object count by one occurs due to merging two adjacent objects of the same color. This happens when these objects meet certain criteria involving their position, size, and color difference.
overall pattern: Transform any input into output using the following steps:
1. Identify objects and analyze them.
2. Determine whether objects fulfill the merge condition.
3. Merge qualifying objects by updating their color, position, and size accordingly.
4. Eliminate extra object information to obtain the final output.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (1). The number of objects varies and they can appear at any position in the sequence. Some objects may be overlapping, but none are contained within each other. All objects together occupy approximately half of the total sequence length.
output: Across all output sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (6 or 1). The number of objects decreases by one compared to the input. Their positions shift towards the beginning of the sequence and their sizes increase, covering more consecutive indices than in the input. There are no noise pixels present in the output sequences.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 1 that are adjacent or separated by noise pixels will merge into a single object with color 6 in the output.
overall pattern: For every pair of input objects with color 1 that meet the condition above, create a single output object with color 6 whose position is determined by the position of the first input object in the pair, and increase the size of the output object to cover the combined length of the input objects.

**Regarding Examples 2 and 3:**

Conditions Analysis: The conditions hold true for these examples without modification since there are no additional nuances introduced.
Overall Pattern Analysis: The overall pattern still holds true after analyzing both examples.
Precision Analysis: The overall pattern remains applicable, though further clarification might help avoid potential misinterpretations when dealing with noise pixels separating objects with color 1.
Value Rating: I would rate the precision and accuracy of this pattern slightly lower due to the lack of clarity around noise pixels. A suggested value of 7 could reflect this uncertainty.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Their positions shift towards the beginning of the sequence and their sizes increase, covering more consecutive indices than in the input. There are no noise pixels present in the output sequences.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they are not the first object in the input sequence. This condition is based on the object color and position.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, find the first object, if it exists. For each subsequent object, replace it with a new object with color 6, increasing its size to cover the same number of consecutive indices as the original object minus one. The starting index of the new object is the same as the original object. The new sequence will have one less object than the original sequence, but the total number of pixels will remain the same.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of groups of consecutive 1s of varying sizes, ranging from 1 to 7. In some cases, multiple objects may appear in the input sequence.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always exactly one object, consisting of a group of consecutive 6s, replacing the original groups of 1s in the input sequence.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (1). The number of objects varies and they can appear at any position in the sequence. Some objects may be overlapping, but none are contained within each other. All objects together occupy approximately half of the total sequence length.
output: Across all output sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (6 or 1). The number of objects decreases by one compared to the input. Their positions shift towards the beginning of the sequence and their sizes increase, covering more consecutive indices than in the input. There are no noise pixels present in the output sequences.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 1 that are adjacent or separated by noise pixels will merge into a single object with color 6 in the output.
overall pattern: For every pair of input objects with color 1 that meet the condition above, create a single output object with color 6 whose position is determined by the position of the first input object in the pair, and increase the size of the output object to cover the combined length of the input objects.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of groups of consecutive 1s of varying sizes, ranging from 1 to 7. In some cases, multiple objects may appear in the input sequence.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always exactly one object, consisting of a group of consecutive 6s, replacing the original groups of 1s in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when there are groups of 1s in the input, regardless of their size or position.
overall pattern: For any given input, search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0). Replace every such sequence at once with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input. This results in a consistent mapping between input and output objects across all examples.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (1). The number of objects varies and they can appear at any position in the sequence. Some objects may be overlapping, but none are contained within each other. All objects together occupy approximately half of the total sequence length.
output: Across all output sequences, objects consist of adjacent pixels of the same color (6 or 1). The number of objects decreases by one compared to the input. Their positions shift towards the beginning of the sequence and their sizes increase, covering more consecutive indices than in the input. There are no noise pixels present in the output sequences.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 1 that are adjacent or separated by noise pixels will merge into a single object with color 6 in the output.
overall pattern: For every pair of input objects with color 1 that meet the condition above, create a single output object with color 6 whose position is determined by the position of the first input object in the pair, and increase the size of the output object to cover the combined length of the input objects.



transformation steps: ['1. Iterate through the input sequence.', '2. Initialize an empty list to store output objects.', '3. While iterating through the input sequence, perform the following steps when encountering an object with color 1:', '	4. If there is a current output object being tracked, check if it has the same color (6) as the last merged input object.', ''		5.a. If the colors match, update the end index of the current output object to include this new segment.', ''		5.b. Otherwise, append the current output object to the output list and start tracking a new output object with the current input object details.', '	6. When the loop ends, append the final output object in the tracking list to the final result.', '7. Return the final output list as the transformed sequence.']

Value Outputs:
 Here's the evaluation of the given transformation steps in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. However, step 4 could be improved by checking if there is a current output object being tracked, regardless of its color. This would ensure that newly encountered input objects with color 1 are always added as a new output object.",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. The steps handle adjacency and merging of input objects with color 1 appropriately.",
    "value": 10
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. They properly account for cases where input objects with color 1 are separated by noise pixels.",
    "value": 10
  }
}
```

While the transformation steps generally work correctly, I noticed that step 4 only checks if there is a current output object with color 6, instead of just checking if there is a current output object being tracked. To make the steps more robust, I suggest updating step 4 to check for any currently tracked output object, regardless of its color.
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly identify and handle objects with color 1 in the input sequence, merging them into a single object with color 6 in the output while increasing the size appropriately. However, the steps do not explicitly address how to initialize the tracking of the first output object and the termination condition for the loop.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps work well for this example, accurately identifying and merging the objects with color 1 across multiple instances. Similar to Example_1, initialization of tracking the first output object and the termination condition for the loop are not addressed explicitly.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps perform adequately for this example too, handling cases where objects with color 1 might overlap with other non-object elements. Again, initializing the tracking of the first output object and specifying the termination condition for the loop are not explicitly mentioned.",
    "value": 8
  }
}
```

In general, the given transformation steps successfully combine adjacent or nearby objects with color 1 into single objects with color 6 in the output while preserving the overall structure described. Nevertheless, some improvements could be made regarding clarity about initializing and terminating the tracking of output objects during the iteration process.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, objects consist of groups of consecutive 1s of varying sizes, ranging from 1 to 7. In some cases, multiple objects may appear in the input sequence.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always exactly one object, consisting of a group of consecutive 6s, replacing the original groups of 1s in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when there are groups of 1s in the input, regardless of their size or position.
overall pattern: For any given input, search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0). Replace every such sequence at once with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input. This results in a consistent mapping between input and output objects across all examples.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the provided test output sequence, it appears that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Here's the step-by-step evaluation:

Transformation Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) in the input sequence.
- Test Input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Sequences matching this condition are: [1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Transformation Step 2: Replace each such sequence found in step 1 with a new sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s while retaining the exact position and size in the input sequence.
- Updated Test Output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Given the correct application of these transformation steps to the test input sequence, I would rate the test output as '10'.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence by analyzing each step of the transformation algorithm.

Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) in the input sequence.

In the test input sequence, we can identify two such sequences:
1. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] starting at index 4 and ending at index 10
2. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] starting at index 18 and ending at index 24

Step 2: Replace each such sequence found in step 1 with a new sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s while retaining the exact position and size in the input sequence.

In the test output sequence, we can see that these two sequences of 1s have been replaced with sequences of 6s:
1. [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] at index 4 and ending at index 10
2. [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] at index 18 and ending at index 24

Since the test output sequence matches the expected result according to both steps of the transformation algorithm, we can assume that the transformation was applied correctly. Therefore, our judgment is:

{
  "test_output_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence has been correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",

Value Outputs:
 Based on the problem description and the given test case, here's the evaluation of the test output sequence:

1. Verify the presence of objects: Identify groups of consecutive 1s in the input sequence.
   Input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Groups of consecutive 1s found:
   - Group 1: Start index = 4; End index = 10
   - Group 2: Start index = 11; End index = 18

2. Check if the replacement rule has been followed: Compare the positions and lengths of the identified groups of consecutive 1s in the input with those of the replaced groups of consecutive 6s in the output.
   Output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   Groups of consecutive 6s found:
   - Group 1: Start index = 4; End index = 10
   - Group 2: Start index = 11; End index = 18

Since the positions and lengths of the groups match after applying the replacement mentioned in the transformation steps, it can be confirmed that the test output sequence has undergone correct transformation based on the provided rules. Therefore, I would rate the test output as follows:

{"test_output_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence appears to have been correctly transformed into its test output sequence.", "value": 10}
------
 Based on the given input-output pairs and the description of the transformation pattern, it can be observed that:

* Input sequences consist of consecutive groups of 1's of various sizes and positions.
* Output sequences consist of exactly one consecutive group of 6's that replaces the group(s) of 1's in the input sequence.

Given the transformation steps, we can evaluate whether the given test output sequence is the correct result of applying the transformation to the test input sequence. Here is how the evaluation would look like:

Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1's and no other numbers (including 0) in the input sequence.

Test input sequence: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Consecutive sequences of 1's: [[1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]

Step 2: Replace each such sequence found in step 1 with a new sequence of equal length, filled with 6's instead of 1's while retaining the exact position and size in the input sequence.

Test output sequence: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

It can be seen that the consecutive sequences of 1's in the test input sequence were replaced by consecutive sequences of 6's of the same length and position, resulting in the given test output sequence. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the test output sequence as 10 out of 10.

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation algorithm. We will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence has been correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

Transformation Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) in the input sequence.
For the given input, we can identify two such consecutive sequences of 1s: [1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Transformation Step 2: Replace each such sequence found in Step 1 with a new sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s while retaining the exact position and size in the input sequence.
In the output, we see two consecutive sequences of 6s in the correct positions: [6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. These replacements match the identified sequences of 1s in the input.

Since both steps were performed correctly according to our evaluation, it suggests that the given test output sequence successfully applies the requested transformation to the input sequence. However, please note that this evaluation assumes that the input and output sequences provided are accurate representations of the transformation. To further solidify confidence in the model, more comprehensive testing would be required.

Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) in the input sequence.
In the test input sequence, we find the following matches:
[1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Step 2: Replace each such sequence found in step 1 with a new sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s while retaining the exact position and size in the input sequence.
In the test output sequence, we see the following replacements:
[6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], and [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6].

Since the test output sequence shows the correct application of the two transformation steps, we can conclude that the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, let's examine the test input sequence: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can see that it contains a single object of consecutive 1s with a size of 8 starting at index 4, and another object of consecutive 1s with a size of 9 starting at index 10. All other elements are either 0 or separated by 0s.

Now, let's compare this to the test output sequence: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can observe that there is exactly one object in this sequence, which consists of consecutive 6s. Its size is 8, starting at index 4, which matches the first object in the test input sequence. Also, the second object in the test input sequence has been replaced by a sequence of 6s with the correct size (9) and starting index (10) in the test output sequence. No other changes were made to the test input sequence.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the test output sequence accurately reflects the application of the described transformation steps to the test input sequence. Therefore, I would rate the test output sequence as a 10.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the expected transformation pattern and test input sequence. We will compare the test output sequence to the transformation steps described.

Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0).

For the given test input sequence:

```
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

We can identify two consecutive sequences containing only 1s at positions 5-8 and 9-14, and another sequence at positions 17-22:

```
[..., 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,...]
```

Step 2: Replace each identified sequence with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input.

In the test output sequence, we see the correct replacement of these sequences based on the given rule. However, there seems to be an additional subsequence `[6, 6]`, which does not correspond to any subsequence in the input. It appears at positions 12 and 13, where the input has three zeros. Therefore, this test output sequence violates the prescribed rules.

To summarize, our evaluation reveals that the test output sequence undergoes most parts of the desired transformation but introduces new elements that do not correspond to the input sequence. As a result, it does not meet the specified criteria entirely. Thus, I would rate the test output sequence with a value of 5 out of 10 due to introducing unrelated subsequences during the transformation process. If you remove those extra subsequences, then the output will match the expectations completely.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given test input sequence using the described transformation. The transformation involves searching for consecutive sequences of 1s and replacing them with an equally sized sequence of 6s, preserving the starting index and size.

Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) in the test input sequence. We find three such occurrences:

1. Index range: [4, 8]
2. Index range: [11, 18]
3. Index range: [20, 26]

Step 2: Replace each identified sequence with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input. After applying these replacements, we obtain the test output sequence:

[0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

However, this does not match the given test output sequence. It seems like the given test output sequence did implement the correct transformation but failed to replace the second object (11 to 18) with 6s as required by the instructions. Therefore, I cannot approve the given test output sequence as it fails to pass the complete set of transformation rules.

Replace every such sequence at once with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input. This results in a consistent mapping between input and output objects across all examples.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the transformation steps, it can be observed that the test output sequence properly adheres to the required rules. Here's the evaluation of the test output sequence against the given transformation steps:

Transformation Step 1: Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0)
In the test input sequence: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can find two consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers: [1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

Transformation Step 2: Replace each identified sequence with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input
In the test input sequence, the first sequence [1] has been replaced by [6], and the second sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] has been replaced by [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. This matches the test output sequence perfectly.

Rating: Given the correct application of the provided transformation steps, I would rate the test output highly and assign it a value of 10. Therefore, the final result is:
{
'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.',
'value': 10
}
------
 Here is the analysis of the test output sequence:

First, let's examine the input sequence: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

According to the problem description, we need to search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) and replace them with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input.

Now, let's look at the test output sequence: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

It appears that the transformation has been applied correctly to the input sequence:

* Consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0) have been replaced by a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s.
* All occurrences of these sequences have been replaced consistently throughout the sequence.
* The exact positions and sizes of the original sequences have been retained.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10.

In summary, the given test output sequence seems to be correct according to the provided input sequence and the described transformation steps.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the description, overall pattern, and transformation steps provided, it appears that the test output sequence has been generated by applying the correct transformation to the test input sequence. Here's how we can verify this:

1. Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0):
   - In the test input sequence, we find three such sequences:
     - Sequence 1: starting index = 3, ending index = 8
     - Sequence 2: starting index = 13, ending index = 23
     - Sequence 3: starting index = 28, ending index = 31
   
2. Replace each identified sequence with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input:
   - We replace the sequences found in Step 1 with 6s in the test output sequence:
     - Test Input: [0, 0, 1, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, 0,...] => Test Output: [0, 0, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, 0,...]
     - Test Input: [...] 0, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, 0,...] => Test Output: [... 0, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, 0,...]
     - Test Input: [...] 0, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**, **1**,**1**, 0, 0, 0,...] => Test Output: [... 0, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, 0, 0, 0,...]

Since the test output matches our expectations based on the given information and the transformation rules, I would rate the accuracy of the transformation as 10 out of 10.

In conclusion:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consistent with the given transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
  "value": 10
}

------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence:

First, we apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence:

1. Search for all consecutive sequences containing only 1s and no other numbers (including 0):
   We find two such sequences: [1], with a length of 1, starting at index 2; and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], with a length of 7, starting at index 5.

2. Replace each identified sequence with a single sequence of equal length, filled with 6s instead of 1s, while retaining the exact position and size in the input:
   We replace the first sequence found in step 1 with [6]. Next, we replace the second sequence with [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]:

   Result: [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Comparing this result with the test output sequence, we can see they match perfectly. Therefore, based on the provided context and transformation steps, we conclude that the test output sequence has been derived correctly from the test input sequence.
