The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: The input sequences consist of adjacent pixels of the same color, separated by background pixels. There can be multiple groups of adjacent pixels of the same color, varying in length and starting location.\noutput: The output sequences consist of adjacent pixels of the same color, separated by background pixels. The first group of adjacent pixels, if present, does not change its relative position, but may decrease or increase in length. All other groups of adjacent pixels get shifted towards the end of the sequence and decreased to one pixel, while the intervening space gets filled with background pixels.\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects disappear when they are surrounded completely by background pixels and other objects. If objects are not completely surrounded, then their position shifts towards right relative to the previous object.\noverall pattern: First object does not change. Other objects disappear if completely surrounded by background pixels and shift towards right if partially surrounded by background pixels. They also reduce to one pixel in size when shifted.\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Here is the JSON response to your request:\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions accurately describe the input sequence, highlighting the presence of adjacent pixels of the same color separated by background pixels, and varying in length and starting location.\",\n        \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern appears to correctly describe the transformation from input to output for this example. Specifically, the first object remains unchanged, while other objects disappear if completely surrounded by background pixels and shift towards the right otherwise.\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern seems to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output. It provides clear rules for how objects behave based on their surrounding pixels.\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    },\n    \"Example_2\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n        \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n        \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    }\n}\n```\nIn summary, the given conditions and overall pattern seem to accurately describe the relation between the input and output sequences for all three examples provided. Furthermore, the overall pattern appears to be precise enough to apply to a new input and generate the correct output. Therefore, I have assigned a value of 10 to each example, indicating full confidence in the accuracy of the given information.\n------\n Here's the analysis in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions accurately describe the input and are relevant to determining the object changes. However, it could be more specific about what 'completely surrounded' means.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern seems to accurately describe the transformation from input to output. It captures the idea that some objects do not change, while others disappear or move depending on their surroundings.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern provides a good basis for understanding how to transform a new input to its output, but it might require additional precision in certain cases (e.g., exactly how many pixels an object shifts).\",\n    \"value\": 8\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1.\",\n    \"value\": 8\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1.\",\n    \"value\": 8\n  }\n}\n```\nOverall, the given pattern seems to provide an accurate description of the relationship between the input and output sequences across all three examples. However, there is room for improvement in terms of precision, particularly around how the relative position of objects shifts based on their surrounding context."

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence.

According to the rules, this object remains unchanged in the output sequence.\n\nNext, we examine each subsequent object in the input sequence. We notice that the second object `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is completely surrounded by background pixels, so it should disappear in the output sequence.\n\nThen, we look for any objects that have shifted toward the right due to partial surrounding by background pixels.

Specifically, the provided test output contains another instance of the first object (`[1, 0, 0, 1]`) at the end of the sequence, but this extra object is not present in our calculated output.\n\nGiven these observations, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10, since it fails to adhere to the specified transformation rules and produces an incorrect result compared to the expected output.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the first object in the input sequence (if it exists). This object will remain unchanged in the output sequence.\n\t* In our test case, the first object is [1, 0, 0, 1]. It remains unchanged in the output sequence.\n2. For each subsequent object in the input sequence, check if it is completely surrounded by background pixels. If yes, then this object disappears in the output sequence. If no, then the object's position shifts towards the right relative to the previous object in the input sequence.\n\t* [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]: These pixels are completely surrounded by background pixels, so they disappear in the output sequence.\n\t* [1, 0, 0, 1]: This object shifts towards the right, becoming [0, 0, 1, 0].\n3. If an object has shifted towards the right due to partial surrounding by background pixels, its size reduces to one pixel in the output sequence.\n\t* [0, 0, 1, 0]: Since there is no partial surrounding by background pixels, nothing changes.\n4. Fill the intervening spaces left behind by removed or shrunken objects with background pixels in the output sequence.\n\t* No need to fill gaps since they don't exist based on previous steps.\n\nHowever, we observe that the output [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] doesn't match the expected output provided in the question. There seems to be a discrepancy between the actual output and the expected output:\n\n* Expected output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIt appears that either the provided transformation instructions were misapplied during testing, or the expected result needs revision. We cannot validate whether the process was followed correctly without ensuring that the result matches the given rules explicitly. Therefore, I am unable to provide a rating at this time.\n\nIn conclusion, please double-check both the application of the transformation rules and the expected output. Provide updated information accordingly before requesting a rating.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Identify the first object in the input sequence, if it exists. This object will remain unchanged in the output sequence.\n   - In the test case, the first object is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. It remains unchanged in the output sequence, so this step is correct.\n\n2. For each subsequent object in the input sequence, check if it is completely surrounded by background pixels. If yes, then this object disappears in the output sequence. If no, then the object's position shifts towards the right relative to the previous object in the input sequence.\n   - The second object [1, 0, 0, 1] is not completely surrounded by background pixels, so it shifts towards the right in the output sequence. However, in the provided output it disappears instead of shifting. So, this step is incorrect.\n\n3. If an object has shifted towards the right due to partial surrounding by background pixels, its size reduces to one pixel in the output sequence.\n   - Since step 2 is incorrect, this step is not applicable for the test case.\n\n4. Fill the intervening spaces left behind by removed or shrunken objects with background pixels in the output sequence.\n   - Again, since step 2 is incorrect, this step is not applicable for the test case.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the test output sequence shows an error in applying the transformation algorithm correctly. Therefore, the rating would be 2 out of 10, indicating significant issues in implementing the transformation steps.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation rules.\n\nFirst, we identify the first object in the input sequence, which starts at index 3 (1-based) and ends at index 6. In the output sequence, this object remains unchanged, so the condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, we examine subsequent objects (starting from index 7) in the input sequence. We observe the following:\n\n1. At indices 7-14, there is an object made up of continuous 1s. Since it is surrounded entirely by background pixels, this object should disappear in the output sequence, but it doesn't. Instead, all its elements become zeros, except for the last two, making this inconsistent with the expected behavior.\n2. Between indices 15 and 16, there is another single-pixel object in the input sequence. After checking for complete surrounding by background pixels, this object vanishes correctly in the output sequence since it meets the conditions described.\n3. Finally, a single-pixel object appears at index 29 in the input sequence, and it correctly disappears in the output sequence since it's completely surrounded by background pixels.\n\nAdditionally, note that none of the remaining objects change positions or sizes during this process.\n\nSince the second object in our examination did not behave according to expectations, even though some aspects of the output are consistent with the rules, the output still contains errors. Therefore, the value must be lower than 10 to reflect imperfect adherence to the specified transformation requirements. A fair rating would be around 5 out of 10.\n\nIn summary, here's what I recommend for the JSON response:\n\n{\n\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\"\n\"value\": 5\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

According to the rules, this object remains unchanged in the output sequence. So far so good.\n\nNext, we look at each subsequent object in the input sequence. The second object is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. It is not completely surrounded by background pixels, so it shifts towards the right relative to the previous object. However, in the output sequence, all elements of this object have disappeared, which is incorrect.\n\nThere are no other objects in the input sequence, so the remaining transformation steps do not apply.\n\nIn conclusion, the test output sequence does not match the expected output. The second object in the input sequence should not have disappeared entirely. The rating would be 3 out of 10, as the first object was correctly identified and preserved, but the transformation of the second object was not performed according to the rules.\n\nThe correct test output sequence should be: [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify the first object in the input sequence, which is the subsequence [1, 0, 0, 1].

We notice that there is another object [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] starting at index 7 and ending at index 17. This object is completely surrounded by background pixels, so it should disappear in the output sequence.

In this case, we find that the first object [1, 0, 0, 1] has shifted towards the right by two positions (from indices 3-6 to indices 5-8). Since it has shifted, its size is reduced to one pixel. Therefore, the correct output sequence should be [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nComparing the expected output sequence with the given test output sequence, we find discrepancies. Specifically, the given test output sequence lacks the single pixel object resulting from the shift of the initial object, meaning that the final step of filling the remaining gaps with background pixels has been performed incorrectly.\n\nAs a result, the given test output sequence should NOT be considered correct since the transformation was not fully applied according to the specified rules.\n\nThe response in JSON format would be:\n\n{\n  'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.',\n  'value': 4\n}\n\nWe provide a lower score because there is an evident failure during the gap-filling process; however, most of the transformation steps were properly executed before that stage.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Since the output sequence contains a single `1` at index 6, this condition holds true.\n\nNext, we examine each subsequent object in the input sequence (Step 2). We notice that there is another object consisting of five consecutive `1`s starting at index 13. Let's verify whether it follows the rule described in Step 2: \"If no, then the object's position shifts towards the right relative to the previous object in the input sequence.\" However, in our test case, this second object vanishes entirely instead of shifting to the right. Therefore, the test output fails to satisfy the requirement specified in Step 2.\n\nAs a result, further investigation of Steps 3 and 4 becomes unnecessary because the overall transformation pattern isn't followed correctly from the beginning.\n\nIn conclusion, the test output sequence cannot be considered as a correct application of the given transformation algorithm since it violates one of the fundamental rules outlined in Step 2. Hence, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10 due to minor adherence to some aspects of the transformation pattern.\n\nThe expected output should look like this:\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.\n\nFirst, we identify the first object (if it exists) that remains unchanged in the output sequence.

This object indeed remains unchanged in the test output sequence.\n\nNext, for each subsequent object in the input sequence (starting from the second object), we check whether it is completely surrounded by background pixels. Here are the objects in order along with their status:\n\n1. [1, 0, 0]: Partially surrounded by background pixels, so it moves toward the right in the output sequence.\n2. [1]: Completely surrounded by background pixels, so it vanishes in the output sequence.\n\nAfter moving the first surviving object, there is an empty spot where the vanished object used to be. We fill this gap with background pixels.\n\nFinally, we look at the surviving object's size. Since the object [1, 0, 0] is still partially surrounded by background pixels, we need to reduce its size to one pixel in the output sequence.\n\nPutting everything together, we see that the given test output sequence follows the provided transformation steps.

The expected behavior for the first object is unchanged, so the test passes for the first object.\n\nNext, we look for any objects completely surrounded by background pixels. We see that the two consecutive occurrences of 1's (indices 6-14) are completely surrounded by background pixels, so they should not appear in the output sequence. The test passes for this condition since those pixels disappeared in the output.\n\nWe then proceed to shift the other objects towards the right. After checking the conditions, we notice that there is just one more object left - the last sequence of five 1's. Since it has a distance greater than 1 pixel to the next object, we need to shift it towards the right by adding background pixels before it. However, the test fails here because the fifth 1 in the output still appears at its initial position instead of being moved further to the right.\n\nSince there is a failure in the third step, no further evaluation is needed. But, assuming the third step had been done correctly, the fourth step would involve filling background pixels between objects to prevent overlapping, and the result should match the given test output.\n\nIn summary, based on the current analysis, the value of the test output would be 7 out of 10, considering the successful execution of the first two steps and the failure in the third step.\n\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify the first object in the input sequence:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nFirst object: {color: 1, start\\_index: 3, end\\_index: 3, size: 1}\n\nNext, we check if any other objects are completely surrounded by background pixels:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 1, **0**, **0**, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nCompletely surrounded objects: [{color: 1, start\\_index: 13, end\\_index: 16, size: 4}]\nThese objects do not appear in the output sequence.\n\nWe then shift other objects towards the right:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 1, **0**, **0**, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nShifted objects:\n[0, 0, 0, 1, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nReduced size:\n[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLastly, we fill in background pixels between objects:\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nComparing the expected output sequence to the actual output sequence reveals discrepancies.

Identify the first object in the input sequence:\n   - Test Input: First object starts at index 3 with color 1.\n   - Test Output: First object stays at index 3 with color 1.\n2. Check if any other objects are completely surrounded by background pixels:\n   - Test Input: Second object (indices 6-14) is not completely surrounded. Third object (indices 25-26) is completely surrounded.\n   - Test Output: Third object disappears as expected.\n3. Shift other objects towards the right:\n   - Test Input: Second object (indices 6-14) should move towards index 15.\n   - Test Output: Second object moved to indices 14-22 instead of 6-14.\n4. Fill in background pixels between objects:\n   - Test Input: After shifting objects, background pixels should be added between indices 15 and 24, and indices 24 and 25.\n   - Test Output: Background pixels were added between indices 23 and 32 but not between indices 15 and 24, nor between indices 24 and 25.\n\nThe test output fails to correctly apply steps 3 and 4. Therefore, based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10 since the first two steps were performed correctly but the last two transformation steps had errors.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation steps.\n\nStep 1: Identify the first object in the input sequence\nIn the test input sequence, the first object starts at index 3 with color 1, so this step seems to have been applied correctly.\n\nStep 2: Check if any other objects are completely surrounded by background pixels\nIn the test input sequence, the second object (starting at index 6) and third object (starting at index 14) meet this condition, so they should not be included in the output sequence. However, since we cannot directly confirm whether this step has been correctly applied without seeing the intermediate results, let's continue evaluating the remaining steps.\n\nStep 3: Shift other objects towards the right\nIn the test output sequence, the fourth object (starting at index 23) appears to have been shifted to the far right, and its size has been reduced to just one pixel. It seems that this step has been applied correctly for this particular object.\n\nStep 4: Fill in background pixels between objects\nThis step seems to have been applied correctly throughout the entire test output sequence, as adjacent pixels of the same color are well-separated by background pixels.\n\nNow, even though some or all of the transformation steps seem to have been applied correctly, the issue lies in Step 2. Since two objects were completely surrounded by background pixels, neither should appear in the output sequence. As a result, let's rate the test output based on the partial correctness:\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'The first object has been identified successfully. Two out of three objects that should have disappeared due to being completely surrounded by background pixels did not make it to the output. Only the last object appears to be shifted and shrunken correctly. Additionally, background pixels have been inserted appropriately between pixels of the same color.', 'value': '5'}\n\nKeep in mind that further investigation would be required to accurately pinpoint where exactly the error happened during applying the second step."
