The input condition description specifies the properties of the input object that are relevant for determining the object changes, such as its adjacency, same color, and location in the sequence. The overall pattern captures the shift in the start index of the output object relative to the input object while preserving its color and size. Finally, the overall pattern appears to be precise enough to generalize to new inputs, although further testing would be required to confirm this."

At step 1, the starting and ending indices of the non-noise object (consisting of 3s) are identified as 2 and 21 respectively. Step 2 initializes the `current_object`. Steps 3a and 3b handle incorporating noise pixels (0s) and updating the `current_object` accordingly. Finally, step 4 appends the remaining `current_object` to the output sequence.\nvalue: 10\n\nExample\\_2:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Similar to Example\\_1, the transformation steps accurately transform the input sequence into the desired output sequence. The non-noise object (composed of 5s) starts at index 2 and ends at index 27. Steps 1-4 effectively process the sequence, dealing with noise pixels and merging consecutive pixels of the same value.\nvalue: 10\n\nExample\\_3:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Again, the transformation steps work correctly for this example.

As a result, the object moves towards the right side of the sequence, matching the expected output.\nvalue: 10\n\nExample\\_2:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Similar to Example\\_1, the transformation steps work correctly for this example. The object expands, incorporates the noise pixels, splits, and finally matches the output sequence's object location.\nvalue: 10\n\nExample\\_3:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Although there is only one object in this example, the initial position differs from the previous examples since it starts from the second position instead of the first. Nonetheless, the transformation steps handle this case effectively. By skipping the leading noise pixels, identifying the object, and then moving the object to the end of the sequence by absorbing the intermediate noise pixels, the final output aligns with the expected result.\nvalue: 10\n\nIn conclusion, based on analyzing the provided examples, the transformation steps accurately reflect how to transform the input sequences into their corresponding output sequences.

The object in the input starts at index 1 and extends to index 17. After shifting the start index by 3 positions towards the end, it should be at index 14. But in the output, the object starts at index 5, which doesn't match. So, the transformation steps don't correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence for this example.\nvalue: 0\n\nOverall, while the transformation steps accurately describe the process for Examples 1 and 2, they fail for Example 3.

The object starts at index 2 in the input and shifts to index 6 in the output, which aligns with step 2. The noise pixels at the beginning of the input sequence are removed in the output, which matches step 3.

The object starts at index 2 in the input and shifts to index 6 in the output, which aligns with step 2.

Thus, the transformation steps accurately depict the transformation for this example.\nvalue: 10\n\nExample\\_3:\ntransformation\\_analysis: In this case, the transformation steps still correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence. However, since the object starts at index 0 in the input, it remains at index 0 in the output after shifting, but its size decreases due to the removal of noise pixels at the beginning of the sequence. This corresponds to steps 2 and 3. Overall, the transformation steps correctly describe the transformation for this example too.\nvalue: 10\n\nThese evaluations show that the transformation steps are accurate and correctly describe the transformation for all three examples.

The overall pattern suggests that if an object encounters a noise pixel, it incorporates it and increases its size until another noise pixel is encountered, upon which it splits. The transformation steps involve identifying the object, searching for the first noise pixel before the object, including the noise pixel and subsequent pixels as part of the object, splitting the object based on new boundaries, repeating the process for all noise pixels, keeping the original object color unchanged, and placing the enlarged and potentially split objects back into the output sequence according to their relative positions determined by the noise pixels.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the test input and output sequences.\n\nTest Input Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTest Output Sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n\nFrom the test output sequence, it seems like the object consisting of 8s has been extended beyond the actual length of the initial object and covers the whole sequence except for the initial four zeros. If we were to compare this to the transformation steps mentioned earlier, this does not seem to follow the expected behavior. Specifically, it contradicts Step 6, where the original object color should remain unchanged, and Step 7, where the objects should be placed back into the output sequence according to their relative positions determined by the noise pixels. Since the output sequence violates both conditions, I would rate the transformation as incorrect.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

Reset `current_object` to an empty array.\n\n   Let's apply this step by stepping through the input sequence, starting right after the identified object:\n\n   - Index 25: Noise pixel (0). Append `current_object` = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] to the output sequence. Reset `current_object` to an empty list.\n   - Index 26: Noise pixel (0).

Reset `current_object` to an empty list.\n   - Index 28: Noise pixel (0). Append `current_object` = [] to the output sequence. Reset `current_object` to an empty list.\n\n   3b. Else:\n      i. Add the current pixel value to the `current_object`.\n\n   There are no further pixels left in the sequence other than those already processed above.\n\n4. After iterating through all the elements in the input sequence, append the remaining `current_object` to the output sequence. But in our case, there is nothing left in the `current_object`. So, add an empty list to the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's create a hypothetical output sequence using the results obtained from the steps outlined above:\n\nHypothetical Output: [ [], [], [], [], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [], [], [], [] ]\n\nSince the actual test output is set to None, we cannot perform a direct comparison. Therefore, I would rate the accuracy of the test output as 0 out of 10 because the expected output doesn't match the input sequence. Keep in mind that this rating reflects the discrepancy between what has been generated based on the rules and the provided test output sequence set to None."
