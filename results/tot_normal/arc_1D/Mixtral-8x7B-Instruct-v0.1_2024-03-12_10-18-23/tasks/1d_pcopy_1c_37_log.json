The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': \"based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation\"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change?

Objects may appear multiple times throughout the sequence and may not necessarily appear next to one another.\noutput: Across all output sequences, objects maintain their original color values but may change location or size compared to their positions in the input sequences.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all input sequences, each object consists of consecutive pixels of the same color value, where the size of an object can vary. Objects may appear multiple times throughout the sequence and may not necessarily appear next to one another.\noutput: Across all output sequences, objects maintain their original color values but may change location or size compared to their positions in the input sequences. Specifically, when an object appears before a group of zeros followed by another non-zero element, it will move forward and join that non-zero element, creating a larger object with an increased size.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change location/size depending on whether they appear before groups of zeros followed by a non-zero element. In this case, they merge with other instances of the same color to form a bigger object.\noverall pattern: To transform an input into its corresponding output, find consecutive equal adjacent elements in the input sequence. Move them towards the direction of increasing indices until meeting the next non-zero element. Merge them together so that the resulting object in the output keeps its original color and assumes the final index corresponding to the last element of the merged subsequence.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence. An object is a contiguous sequence of identical non-background (non-zero) pixel values.', 'Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence and identify locations where objects precede a sequence of zeros followed by a non-zero element.', 'Step 3: For each identified location, move the entire object towards the direction of increasing indices until meeting the next non-zero element. This results in merging the object with other instances of the same color, thereby increasing its size.', 'Step 4: Ensure that the resulting object in the output keeps its original color value and assumes the final index corresponding to the last element of the merged subsequence.']\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\n\"Example\\_1\": {\n\"transformation\\_analysis\": \"In Example\\_1, the input sequence contains several objects with color value 4 separated by groups of zeros.

            "prompt_log": "#############################\nFirst node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

Creating a new object with the combined color value, start index set to the determined index of the first non-zero element after the group of zeros (which is 10), and end index set to include all elements up to (but excluding) the subsequent zero or end of the sequence (which is 14): `[Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 10, end_index: 14, size: 5}]`\n\nGiven output sequence does not match the expected output sequence based on the applied transformation steps. There seems to be an extra object with color 1 at the end of the output sequence, which was not present in the input sequence nor produced by any of the transformation steps.\n\nRating: 3 out of 10. The output contains an additional object that does not belong to either of the groups in the input sequence.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify all objects in the input sequence:\n[Object_1: {color: 1, start\\_index: 1, end\\_index: 3}, Object_2: {color: 1, start\\_index: 7, end\\_index: 7}, Object_3: {color: 1, start\\_index: 19, end\\_index: 19}]\n\nNow, we iterate through the identified objects according to the transformation steps:\n\n1.

Check if Object\\_3 appears before a group of zeros followed by another non-zero element: False\n    * Leave the object unchanged in the output sequence\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual output for Object\\_1. In the test output sequence, Object\\_1 should have been moved forward and joined with the next non-zero element (Object\\_2), resulting in a single object spanning from index 1 to 8 instead of two separate objects at indices 1-3 and 7. Therefore, the transformation seems to have been incorrectly applied for Object\\_1.\n\nAs a result, I cannot give a high rating for the test output. Given the inconsistency found, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10. There is clear evidence that the transformation was not fully applied according to the given rules.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

For each object, we check if it appears before a group of zeros followed by another non-zero element.\n\nObject_1 does meet this condition \u2013 it is before a group of zeros, and there is a non-zero element at index 10. Therefore, according to the rules outlined in Step 3, we move the object forward and join it with the next non-zero element. Here's how it looks:\nNew Object_1: {color: 1, start\\_index: 10, end\\_index: 10, size: 1}\n\nNow, we compare the created New Object_1 in the output sequence to the actual output sequence provided.

This results in the output having [1, 1, 1, 1] at indices 1-4 instead of [1, 1, 1] at indices 1-3 and [1] at index 13.\n- Since the second object did not meet the conditions specified, no action was taken.\n- The third object [1] moves four places forward and merges with the other instance of 1 at index 8, resulting in [1, 1, 1, 1] at indices 8-11 instead of [1] at indices 8, 13, and [1] at index 16.\n\nStep 4: Maintain color consistency - Ensure that the color of each object remains unchanged during the movement and merging process.\n- Although there were movements and mergers, the color of every object remained consistent with its initial appearances in the input sequence.\n\nRating: Based on the provided analysis, I would rate the test output as a 7 out of 10.

However, the resulting object is placed at index 11 instead of index 10, causing an extra zero to be inserted between them. This discrepancy leads to a lower rating.\n\nStep 4: Maintain color consistency - Ensure that the color of each object remains unchanged during the movement and merging process.\n- The color of each object remains consistent.\n\nOverall, although most steps were applied correctly, there is an issue with placing the merged object at the correct index, leading to a slightly lower rating.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
