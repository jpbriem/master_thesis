The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': \"based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size?

Iterate over the input sequence from left to right and perform the following actions for each index i:\n   - If the current element at index i is zero, add zero to the output sequence and continue with the next iteration step.\n   - If the current element at index i is a non-zero integer x, create a group of x elements with the value of x, but instead of placing them contiguously, distribute these equally spaced within the subsequent occurrences of the value x. To achieve this:\n     - Determine the number of consecutive appearances of the value x starting from the current index (ni).\n     - Calculate the length of each subgroup (li = ni / x; assuming li is always an integer since x divides ni evenly due to the problem definition).\n     - Place x in every li'th position among the ni upcoming indices, filling the remaining positions with zeroes.\n3.

Identify the current object's value and its length (number of consecutive identical numbers).\n   2. Place the object's value at every position forming a group of that length in the output sequence. To achieve this, iterate over the range(object_value, object_value + length), placing the object's value at those indices within the output sequence.\n   3.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

This matches the expected behavior since the input consists of single colored objects embedded in a background of zeros.\n\n2. For each object X found in the sequence (non-zero numbers), count the number of consecutive appearances N:\n- In the first part of the input, there are three consecutive `3's`, so N = 3.\n- After the initial three `3's`, there is one occurrence of a single `3`. So, N = 1 here.\n- At the end of the input, there is another single `3`. Again, N = 1 here.\n\n3. In the output sequence, replace the first N positions of X with X itself:\n- In the output sequence, the first three positions contain `3's`. However, after these initial `3's`, the next two instances of the number `3` do not follow this rule because their preceding elements are zeros instead of `3's`.\n\n4.

According to these, the goal is to identify consecutive appearances of non-zero numbers in the input sequence, count their occurrences, and then replicate those numbers in groups of equal lengths in the output sequence, filling the rest of the positions with zeros.\n\nNow, let's consider the test input and output sequences:\n```\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nBy looking at the test case, we see there are two consecutive appearances of `3`, one at the beginning with a length of three and another one later with a length of one. Comparing the input and output, the output matches the input exactly, meaning that the given output follows the described rules and transformation steps for the input.\n\nHowever, there is no clear evidence that any actual transformation has taken place since the input and output are identical. We cannot confirm whether the transformation algorithm was followed unless we observe changes in the output compared to the input. In our opinion, providing an unchanged output for a given input doesn't demonstrate sufficient understanding or application of the provided rules and transformation steps.\n\nThat being said, based on the given instructions, we must rate the test output. Since the output matches the input precisely, we cannot find any discrepancies in the transformation process. Therefore, we reluctantly provide the following response:\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Despite the input and output being identical, there seems to be no contradiction with the provided rules and transformation steps.', 'value': '8'}\n\nPlease note that this high rating reflects our confidence in the correctness of the implementation rather than the lack of transformation itself. If additional information suggests that the absence of transformation was intentional (e.g., explicitly stated in the problem text), please adjust the rating accordingly.\n------\n Based on the given input-output pairs and their shared transformation pattern, we can evaluate the correctness of the provided test output sequence for the given test input sequence. Here's the analysis for each transformation step:\n\n1. Iterating through the input sequence is straightforward, and there are no issues observed since the test output contains the same elements as the input.\n2. Counting the number of consecutive appearances of an object is also done without error, as we can see the correct distribution of '3's in the test output whenever they appear in the input.\n3. Replacing the first N positions of X with X itself happens correctly in the test output, matching the original input sequence.\n\nOverall, it seems like the transformation algorithm has been applied correctly to the test input sequence. However, the description states that the remaining positions should be filled with zeros after applying the previous rules. In the test case, some trailing zeros are missing at the very end of the output, making it inconsistent with both the input and the described transformation. We cannot ignore this discrepancy even though most of the output matches the expected behavior.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the given transformation steps and examples, the algorithm seems to have been applied mostly correctly during the conversion of the test input sequence to its respective test output sequence.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all input sequences, they consist of single colored objects embedded in a background of zeros. Each object can appear multiple times along the sequence.\noutput: Regardless of the specific inputs, all output sequences follow the rule where if any nonzero number x appears n times consecutively in the input, it will appear in groups of x, with each group having length n in the output sequence. The rest of the positions will be occupied by zeroes, signifying the background.\n\n\noverall pattern: None\n\ntransformation steps: None\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence. I will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\nStep 1: Identify consecutive appearances of nonzero numbers in the input sequence.\n\t* In the test input sequence, we find three such instances:\n\t\t1. 3 (consecutive 3 times) at indices [2, 3, 4]\n\t\t2. 3 (consecutive 1 time) at index [7]\n\t\t3. 3 (consecutive 1 time) at index [13]\n\nStep 2: Transform the input sequence according to the described pattern. If any nonzero number x appears n times consecutively in the input, it will appear in groups of x, with each group having length n in the output sequence. The rest of the positions will be occupied by zeroes, signifying the background.\n\t* Applying this step to the identified instances in the test input sequence results in the provided test output sequence.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, the given test output is consistent with the expected transformation of the test input sequence. My evaluation results in a perfect score for the transformation process.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'After carefully analyzing every transformation step, the test output seems to be correctly generated from the test input sequence.', 'value': 10}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence against the expected transformation pattern. According to the description, if any nonzero number x appears n times consecutively in the input, it will appear in groups of x, with each group having length n in the output sequence. Let's check this for the test case.\n\nIn the test input sequence, there is a nonzero number 3 appearing three times consecutively at the beginning (ignoring the two leading zeros) followed by three consecutive zeros. In the output, we see exactly what's described - a group of three threes at the beginning. Then, after a gap of zeros, another three appears right before the long trail of zeros. Therefore, the test output seems consistent with the described pattern.\n\nHowever, without more context about the exact transformation steps involved, I cannot provide a thorough validation of the implementation nor assign a numerical score. But based on the available information and checking the output for the given test case, it looks correct.\n\nSo, here's my response in JSON format:\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Given the description of the transformation pattern, it appears that the test output has been generated correctly according to the rules mentioned. It would require further investigation, including actual transformation steps and review of edge cases, to assign a numeric rating. Based solely on the comparison with the given pattern, I can say that the test output matches the expected outcome.', 'value': 'N/A'}"
