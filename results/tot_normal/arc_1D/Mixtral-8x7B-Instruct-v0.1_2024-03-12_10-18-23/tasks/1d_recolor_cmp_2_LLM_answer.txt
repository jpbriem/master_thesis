#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

input: Input sequences consist of various objects represented by adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value. These objects may appear multiple times, vary in length, and include both clusters and isolated pixels. In some cases, objects may overlap or be adjacent to each other without merging.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given input description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other inputs.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given output description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other outputs.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: Across all examples, we observe the presence of two main types of objects in the input sequences: isolated pixels and connected components (groups) of pixels. Isolated pixels consist of individual instances of a non-zero value surrounded entirely by zeros. Connected components can vary greatly in size but always consist of adjacent pixels of the same non-zero value. In some cases, these objects may be interspersed with noise pixels (zeros).
output: While each input sequence has its unique characteristics, the resulting output sequences show clear patterns across examples. Specifically, all outputs feature a replacement of specific input configurations (whether isolated pixels or connected components of varying sizes) with groups of identical size. This suggests an underlying transformation rule where certain conditions exist, leading to consistent changes in the pixel arrangements.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: Input sequences consist of various objects represented by adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value. These objects may appear multiple times, vary in length, and include both clusters and isolated pixels. In some cases, objects may overlap or be adjacent to each other without merging.
output: Output sequences show evidence of a rule-based transformation applied to specific subsets of pixels in the input objects. A new object consisting of pixels with value 5 emerges through this process, replacing original objects according to a consistent condition related to their relative positions and sizes. Isolated noise pixels retain their initial values throughout the transformation.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size?

Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Example_2:

output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

description:
input: Across all these examples, the primary objects consist of elongated consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels or single isolated ones spread across the input sequences. Background noise pixels (color 0) accompany them.
output: In contrast, output sequences demonstrate similar patterns to their matching inputs; however, they have undergone some changes in specific sections originally filled with background color (0). These altered segments now comprise longer consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels, seemingly linked to the lengths and distribution of object_1 instances observed in the corresponding input sequences.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

description:
input: Input sequences consist of various objects represented by adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value. These objects may appear multiple times, vary in length, and include both clusters and isolated pixels. In some cases, objects may overlap or be adjacent to each other without merging.
output: Output sequences show evidence of a rule-based transformation applied to specific subsets of pixels in the input objects. A new object consisting of pixels with value 5 emerges through this process, replacing original objects according to a consistent condition related to their relative positions and sizes. Isolated noise pixels retain their initial values throughout the transformation.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their relative positions and sizes, specifically when they are separated by exactly one noise pixel (color 0). New objects emerge with color 5 due to mergers or splits under specific conditions.
overall pattern: Transform objects with color X into new objects with color Y if and only if they meet the following criteria: 
1. They are separated by exactly one noise pixel (color 0).
2. If splitting occurs, merge eligible sections with neighboring sections of the same color.
3. Replace the original object(s) with color Y.
4. Introduce additional new objects with color Y if splitting results in smaller, distinct sections.
Note that objects with color X that do not meet these criteria remain unchanged.

 Here's the JSON format output:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions mentioned in the pattern only refer to the input and are relevant to determining the object changes. However, the conditions lack precision regarding how exactly to identify the objects that will change.",

    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern seems to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output, but it requires careful interpretation of the conditions stated. Specifically, understanding how to apply the conditions to determine which objects need to change could be challenging.",

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": "7"
  }
}
```

In general, the conditions provided in the overall pattern describe the relationship between the input and output reasonably well. However, there is room for improvement regarding the clarity and precision of the conditions for determining which objects need to change.
------
 Here's the JSON format output:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given conditions properly refer to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes. The conditions mention relative positions and sizes of objects and the appearance of a new object.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The given overall pattern seems to accurately describe the transformation from input to output. It explains how certain objects are changed into new objects based on their positions and sizes, and also introduces a new object with color 5.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern appears to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it clearly defines the rules for changing objects into new ones based on their properties.",

  },
  "Example_2": {
   ... same analysis as Example_1...
  },
  "Example_3": {
   ... same analysis as Example_1...
  }
}
```

In general, the conditions seem to be relevant and sufficient to determine the object changes. The overall pattern provides clear guidance for transforming objects into new ones while preserving their properties, making it accurate and fairly precise. Therefore, I would rate the usefulness of these hints and the pattern highly (8-9 out of 10).

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they meet specific conditions regarding their relative positions and lengths. When an object with color 2 has a length greater than 2 and meets certain position requirements, it is replaced by an object with color 5. This can happen either individually or in groups.
overall pattern: Transform any input into its output by applying the following rules: 1. If an object with color 2 has a length greater than 2 and is surrounded by objects with color 0 or is at the beginning or end of the sequence, replace it with an object with color 5. 2. If multiple consecutive objects with color 2 meet the specified criteria, replace them with a single object with color 5. 3. Leave isolated objects with color 2 unchanged.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: Across all these examples, the primary objects consist of elongated consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels or single isolated ones spread across the input sequences. Background noise pixels (color 0) accompany them.
output: In contrast, output sequences demonstrate similar patterns to their matching inputs; however, they have undergone some changes in specific sections originally filled with background color (0). These altered segments now comprise longer consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels, seemingly linked to the lengths and distribution of object_1 instances observed in the corresponding input sequences.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects alter their color based on specific conditions related to their size and position in the sequence.
overall pattern: To create the output from the input, follow these steps: 1. Identify objects based on their continuous or isolated presence in the input. 2. Determine each object s size. 3. Evaluate whether individual objects meet specific criteria:    - Position: Check if the object starts at the beginning of the sequence.    - Size: Assess if the object s size is equal to or greater than particular thresholds (e.g., 4 or 7). 4. Transform the color of qualified objects to 5 for the output while preserving their positions and sizes.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

description:
input: Across all these examples, the primary objects consist of elongated consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels or single isolated ones spread across the input sequences. Background noise pixels (color 0) accompany them.
output: In contrast, output sequences demonstrate similar patterns to their matching inputs; however, they have undergone some changes in specific sections originally filled with background color (0). These altered segments now comprise longer consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels, seemingly linked to the lengths and distribution of object_1 instances observed in the corresponding input sequences.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change due to the presence of consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels in the input having a length greater than 1.
overall pattern: For every input sequence, scan for consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1. Transform each identified consecutive sequence of color 2 pixels into a consecutive sequence of color 5 pixels in the output by preserving the original starting index and length.

Ensure that no smaller objects (color 2) exist in front of the candidate object.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

description:
input: Across all these examples, the primary objects consist of elongated consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels or single isolated ones spread across the input sequences. Background noise pixels (color 0) accompany them.
output: In contrast, output sequences demonstrate similar patterns to their matching inputs; however, they have undergone some changes in specific sections originally filled with background color (0). These altered segments now comprise longer consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels, seemingly linked to the lengths and distribution of object_1 instances observed in the corresponding input sequences.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change due to the presence of consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels in the input having a length greater than 1.
overall pattern: For every input sequence, scan for consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1. Transform each identified consecutive sequence of color 2 pixels into a consecutive sequence of color 5 pixels in the output by preserving the original starting index and length.



transformation steps: ['Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store the transformed output sequence.', 'Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence using a loop.', 'For each iteration, check if the current pixel and the next one are both equal to 2 and their combined length is greater than 1.', 'Step 3: If the condition is met, replace the current pixel and the consecutive sequence of color 2 pixels with a consecutive sequence of color 5 pixels of the same length, maintaining the original starting index.', 'Step 4: Append the transformed pixels (either unchanged or newly formed color 5 pixels) to the output list.', 'Step 5: After completing the loop, return the final output list as the transformed output sequence.']

overall pattern: First, scan through the input from left to right. Remove objects (color 2) with a length less than 6 and replace the respective areas with background color (0). Then, replace objects (color 2) with a length greater than or equal to 6 with new objects (color 5) at the same positions, preserving their sizes. Ensure that no smaller objects (color 2) exist in front of the candidate object.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

description:
input: Across all these examples, the primary objects consist of elongated consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels or single isolated ones spread across the input sequences. Background noise pixels (color 0) accompany them.
output: In contrast, output sequences demonstrate similar patterns to their matching inputs; however, they have undergone some changes in specific sections originally filled with background color (0). These altered segments now comprise longer consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels, seemingly linked to the lengths and distribution of object_1 instances observed in the corresponding input sequences.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change due to the presence of consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels in the input having a length greater than 1.
overall pattern: For every input sequence, scan for consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1. Transform each identified consecutive sequence of color 2 pixels into a consecutive sequence of color 5 pixels in the output by preserving the original starting index and length.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the problem description, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we will follow the transformation steps provided:

1. An empty list is initialized for the transformed output sequence.
2. We iterate through the input sequence, checking for consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1.
	* Consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1 are found at positions 1-3, 10-12, 16-18, and 21-23.
3. For each consecutive sequence of color 2 pixels:
	* Substep 3.1: The lengths and starting indices are calculated (3, 1), (3, 10), (3, 16), and (3, 21).
	* Substep 3.2: New consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels are created with the same lengths (3, 10, 16, and 21).
	* Substep 3.3: The original starting indices are preserved in the transformed output sequence.
4. Any remaining unaltered pixels from the input sequence are inserted into the transformed output sequence.
5. The transformed output sequence is returned.

Now, compare the resulting transformed output sequence with the provided test output sequence:

Provided test output sequence: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
Resulting transformed output sequence: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]

Since both sequences match exactly, the provided test output sequence appears to be correct based on the given transformation steps. Therefore, our evaluation is:

{
"test_output_analysis": "All steps of the transformation algorithm were followed correctly, and the test input sequence was transformed into the test output sequence accurately.",
"value": 10
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we analyze each step of the transformation algorithm and determine whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into the test output sequence.

1. Step 1: Initializing an empty list to store the transformed output sequence is not directly visible in the test case, but this step does not affect the evaluation of the resulting output sequence.

2. Step 2: In the test input sequence, there are two consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1 located at positions [1, 3] and [10, 13]. This step has been executed correctly.

3. Step 3: We need to verify that consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels were replaced with consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels while maintaining the original starting indices and lengths.
   - Sequence 1: Index: 1, Length: 3; Replacement: Correctly changed to three consecutive color 5 pixels.
   - Sequence 2: Index: 10, Length: 4; Replacement: Correctly changed to four consecutive color 5 pixels.

4. Step 4: All other unmodified pixels in the input sequence (i.e., zeros and isolated twos) have been preserved without modification in the output sequence.

5. Step 5: There are no issues with returning the transformed output sequence since we assume that the provided output is complete and correct.

Given the perfect adherence to the specified transformation rules, we can rate the test output based on how accurately it adheres to the given conditions. Since the test output precisely conforms to the required transformation, providing all expected replacements, we will assign a rating of 10 out of 10.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the problem description, we will manually apply the provided transformation steps to the test input sequence and evaluate the result against the given test output sequence. Since no test output sequence is provided, we assume there's a mistake in the question, so we will create our hypothetical test output based on the transformation rules.

Transformed Test Output Sequence: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]

Now let's apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence:

Initialization: []
Iterating over the input sequence: We find three consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with lengths > 1 at indices 1, 8, and 16.

Transformation Step 3 Details:
First Consecutive Sequence (indices: 1-3): Length = 3, Starting Index = 1
Second Consecutive Sequence (indices: 8-10): Length = 3, Starting Index = 8
Third Consecutive Sequence (indices: 16-18): Length = 3, Starting Index = 16

Applying substep 3.2: Replace the consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with 5 pixels:
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]

Inserting any remaining unaltered pixels (Steps 4 & 5):
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]

Test Output Analysis:
As per the transformation rules, the test input sequence seems to be correctly transformed into the test output sequence we created (i.e., [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]). However, since the actual expected test output sequence is missing, we cannot compare our results directly to the expected outcome. Nonetheless, by applying the transformation steps, we arrived at the assumed correct test output sequence.

Value: 10 (Assuming the transformation has been performed according to the described rules, the test output matches the generated output.)
------
 Based on the provided information, I will evaluate the given test input and potential test output sequences. Here's my analysis:

1. Step 1: The test output is initially an empty list. This seems correct since we need to build the output sequence based on the input.
2. Step 2: Start iterating through the input sequence. We find two consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1 at indices 1 and 9.
3. Step 3: Perform the substeps for both consecutive sequences found in step 2.
   1. Substep 3.1: Calculate the length and starting index of the first consecutive sequence. Length = 3, Starting Index = 1.
      Calculate the length and starting index of the second consecutive sequence. Length = 4, Starting Index = 9.
   2. Substep 3.2: Create new consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels with lengths equal to those calculated above.
      New Sequence 1: [5, 5, 5].
      New Sequence 2: [5, 5, 5, 5].
   3. Substep 3.3: Preserve the original starting index when inserting the new sequences into the transformed output sequence.
      Updated Output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]
4. Since there are no more pixels left in the input sequence after processing the consecutive sequences, step 4 does not apply here.
5. Return the transformed output sequence.

Since the provided output is `None`, it appears that the test output sequence has not been generated according to the described transformation algorithm. After applying the transformation steps to the test input sequence, we obtain the following test output sequence:

`[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]`

Now, let's compare this sequence with the actual expected output:

Expected Output: It is missing from the problem statement. However, considering the rules mentioned earlier, one reasonable expected output could be:

`[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]`

This would maintain consistency with the previous examples where the consecutive sequences of `2` were replaced by consecutive sequences of `5`. Nevertheless, without explicit confirmation, the exact expected output remains uncertain. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate rating.

Output:

 Based on the provided information, we will evaluate the test output sequence for the given test input sequence. Here's the analysis for each step of the transformation algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the transformed output sequence.
   - Pass: An empty list was created for storing the transformed output sequence.

2. Iterate through the input sequence, checking for consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1.
   - Fail: The input sequence contains multiple consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1, but there are no color 5 pixels present in the output sequence.

Since the second step has failed, we cannot proceed with further evaluation. However, based on this failure alone, it seems highly unlikely that the correct transformation was applied to the test input sequence.

Value: 1
(Explanation: Due to the significant issue identified during the first two steps, it is almost certain that the test output sequence does not meet the expectations.)
------
 Based on the given information, let's evaluate the provided test case using the described transformation pattern and steps. I will assume that the test output sequence would follow the same rules as established in the problem description.

First, here's how our initial input looks like represented as objects:

[Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 2, start_index: 8, end_index: 10, size: 3}, Object_3: {color: 2, start_index: 15, end_index: 17, size: 3}]

Now we apply the given transformation steps to determine whether the test output follows the correct transformation procedure.

1. Initialize an empty output list.
2. Scan the input list: find consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels with a length greater than 1. We can identify three such regions, at indices 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17.
3. Applying the substeps for each region:
   1. Region 1 (indices 1-3): Replace with color 5 while keeping the starting index; inserted at index 1.
   2. Region 2 (indices 8-10): Replace with color 5 while keeping the starting index; inserted at index 8.
   3. Region 3 (indices 15-17): Replace with color 5 while keeping the starting index; inserted at index 15.
4. Insert remaining unaltered pixels from the input sequence into the transformed output list.

After applying these steps, the resulting output list should look like this:

[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2].

However, based on the provided information, there seems to be no actual test output specified, so I cannot compare it against our result. Instead, I am assuming that if the test output existed, it should match our derived output above. With the available data, I recommend providing the expected test output to make a more precise evaluation. As it stands, without comparing my proposed output to the real test output, I rate the confidence in the test output being correct as 7 out of 10. There might still be missing context or constraints that could affect the final assessment.#############################

"value": 7
}

Explanation:

1. Step 1: Initialization - Assuming this step was performed correctly without issues.
2. Step 2a (less than 6): At the first occurrence of object_2 (indices 1-3), the condition is met, but replacing it with background color (0) does not match the test output. This reduces our confidence slightly.
3. Step 2b (greater than or equal to 6): From indices 8-13, this condition seems to be satisfied, and we observe color 5 appearing in the test output, so presumably, this section was handled correctly according to the rules.
4. Step 2a (less than 6): Again, at the second occurrence of object_2 (indices 14-16), the condition is met, yet replacing it with the background color (0) doesn't align with the test output.
5. Step 2b (greater than or equal to 6): Finally, the last instance of object_2 satisfies this condition from indices 17-21, resulting in color 5 in the test output again.

Given these observations, two discrepancies were found where expected background color (0) did not appear during the process. However, other parts seem to adhere to the specified instructions accurately. As a result, I rate the test output as a 7 out of 10 due to partial compliance. It would be optimal for the test output to fully satisfy every requirement outlined by the problem description.

Then, replace objects (color 2) with a length greater than or equal to 6 with new objects (color 5) at the same positions, preserving their sizes. Ensure that no smaller objects (color 2) exist in front of the candidate object.

}

Explanation:

1. Step 1: Initializing an empty temporary output sequence is not directly visible in this evaluation, but it's assumed to be done before applying any steps.
2. Step 2: Considering the input and output provided for testing purposes:
   - There is a color 2 object of size 3 at the beginning of the input, but it does not appear in the output, so either it should not have been removed, or other smaller color 2 objects were wrongly included in the removal process later.
   - Smaller color 2 objects further along the input have been replaced by 0's as expected.
   - Longer color 2 objects remain present in the output with their correct sizes but changed to color 5. This matches the description.
3. Step 3: It appears that the replacement has occurred properly since the initial input sequence is not relevant anymore once we apply changes from step 2.

Although most parts match the intended transformation, removing the first three color 2 pixels may need reevaluation. However, without more context regarding how to treat such cases, I rate the test output as 7 out of 10.

This matches the description of Step 2a.\nStep 2a cont.: Moving forward, we find another group of three 2's starting from index 10 in the input, however, in the provided output, this whole segment is replaced by zeros without considering the condition where the size of the group needs to be less than six. But here, the size is three, so it should not be replaced yet. Hence, the output seems incorrect at this point.\nStep 2b cont.: Since the previous group was wrongly processed, let us move further along the sequence. From index 17, we observe that a long chain of four connected 2's exists. Based on our understanding of the rules, this entire section should get changed to 5's instead of zeros because its size is larger than or equal to six. However, in the provided output, it becomes zeros again contradicting the defined conditions. Therefore, the result seems incorrect according to Step 2b.\nStep 3: As mentioned before due to errors in processing during Step 2, replacing the original input sequence with the temporary output sequence leads to wrong results.",

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.

Evaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

description:
input: Across all these examples, the primary objects consist of elongated consecutive sequences of color 2 pixels or single isolated ones spread across the input sequences. Background noise pixels (color 0) accompany them.
output: In contrast, output sequences demonstrate similar patterns to their matching inputs; however, they have undergone some changes in specific sections originally filled with background color (0). These altered segments now comprise longer consecutive sequences of color 5 pixels, seemingly linked to the lengths and distribution of object_1 instances observed in the corresponding input sequences.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their colors, positions, and sizes. Specifically, objects with color 2 are subject to modification depending on their size and position.
overall pattern: First, scan through the input from left to right. Remove objects (color 2) with a length less than 6 and replace the respective areas with background color (0). Then, replace objects (color 2) with a length greater than or equal to 6 with new objects (color 5) at the same positions, preserving their sizes. Ensure that no smaller objects (color 2) exist in front of the candidate object.
