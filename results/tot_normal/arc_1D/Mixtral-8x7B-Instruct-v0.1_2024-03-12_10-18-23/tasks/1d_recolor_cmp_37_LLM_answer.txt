#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

```

Overall, there is no general description provided; therefore, we cannot say whether it fits any specific example. Regarding the inputs, although no general description was provided, each input shares a consistent pattern of having non-zero elements appear in pairs of two adjacent identical numbers. Therefore, the input descriptions do apply to the examples but lack explicitness. As for the outputs, there is an apparent transformation pattern across all three examples, but without more context, it is difficult to determine how generally applicable this observation might be.
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given descriptions for each example:
```json
{
    "Example_1": {
        "input_analysis": "The input description does not provide any specific information about the properties that the input sequence should satisfy. However, it can still be observed that adjacent identical elements (pixels) are grouped together, such as [5, 5], [0, 0], etc., in the input sequence. Therefore, the input description somewhat matches the example but lacks completeness.",
        "output_analysis": "Similar to the input description, the output description is also missing. In this example, consecutive zeros separate groups of non-zero pixels where the last element of one group becomes the first element of another group. Also, within these groups, non-zero elements increase sequentially starting from 5 up until a certain point and then drop back down to 5 again before encountering another series of zeros. This pattern is repeated throughout the entire output sequence.",
        "value": 4
    },
    "Example_2": {
        "input_analysis": "Same observation applies here as well. Although there is no explicit description provided, we can notice that adjacent identical elements are clustered together like [5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0], and so on.",
        "output_analysis": "In the output sequence, when two groups of 5's merge, instead of repeating the aforementioned process of increasing numbers followed by decreasing ones, the value directly jumps from 5 to 9 without creating a continuous range. This inconsistency may lead us to think that perhaps some additional rules apply in those situations.",
        "value": 5
    },
    "Example_3": {
        "input_analysis": "Again, the input description isn't explicitly stated; however, we can see that clusters of identical elements appear, e.g., [5, 5, 5], [0, 0], etc..",
        "output_analysis": "Here, when two groups of five merge, a new scenario emerges compared to Example 2. After merging, the sequence goes from 5 to 9 and then back to 5, following the previously explained behavior. Additionally, after the second merger, the sequence alternates between 5 and 9 values.",
        "value": 6
    }
}
```
It seems that no input or output description was officially provided. Nevertheless, analyzing the examples reveals trends related to how identical elements cluster together within the input and output sequences. Based on these observations, I rated the examples accordingly.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.

input: Across these examples, we see that input sequences consist of objects with varying sizes but consistent color (5). Some objects may be adjacent, forming larger contiguous regions of the same color.
output: Output sequences maintain the spatial organization of objects in the input. In each case where an object exists in the input, it either stays the same or is replaced by a new object of a different color (9) without changing its location.

Value Outputs:
 Here's the JSON response for the analysis of the provided patterns and their applicability to the given examples:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given conditions for Example_1 accurately describe the input sequence in terms of the consistent color (5), varying object sizes, and potential adjacency leading to larger contiguous regions. These conditions are relevant to determining the necessary changes in objects.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "However, there is no clear overall pattern given for this example. Based on the information available, it is unclear how the input transforms into the output.",
    "precision_analysis": "Without a clear overall pattern, it is impossible to assess precision for transforming a new input to its output.",
    "value": 3
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions mentioned apply similarly to Example_2 as well, accounting for the consistent color (5), varying object sizes, and potential adjacencies.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Still, no clear overall pattern has been provided for relating the input sequence to the output sequence.",
    "precision_analysis": "Precision cannot be evaluated due to the lack of a clear pattern.",
    "value": 3
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions hold true for this example too, pointing out the consistent color (5), varying object sizes, and potential formation of larger contiguous regions.",

    "precision_analysis": "An evaluation of precision isn't feasible owing to the missing pattern.",
    "value": 3
  }
}
```

Overall, the conditions specified for the input adequately address the required properties across all three examples. However, the absence of any discernable overall pattern makes it difficult to evaluate the relationship between the given input and output sequences. Additionally, since no general pattern can be found throughout all the cases, it is challenging to assign a satisfactory rating for the precision aspect.
------
 Here's the JSON response based on the information provided:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "In Example_1, the given condition about the consistency of color (5) in the input sequences is relevant for determining the object changes. However, there is no specific mention of how to identify individual objects, making it unclear whether this is sufficient.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The given overall pattern does not provide a clear rule for transforming the input to output, especially since it doesn't specify when the input object should stay the same or be replaced by the new object (9).",
    "precision_analysis": "Without a clear rule, the given overall pattern is not precise enough to transform a new input to its output.",
    "value": 3
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1, the given condition is relevant but might not be sufficient to determine the object changes due to the lack of specification of identifying individual objects.",

    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1, the given overall pattern is not precise enough to transform a new input to its output.",

  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as previous examples, the given condition is relevant but might not be sufficient to determine the object changes.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as previous examples, the given overall pattern does not provide a clear rule for transforming the input to output.",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as previous examples, the given overall pattern is not precise enough to transform a new input to its output.",
    "value": 3
  }
}
```

A more precise overall pattern could be: "If two neighboring objects of color 5 are separated by one background pixel (0), replace the central background pixel with color 9." This pattern would need to be confirmed across multiple examples to ensure accuracy.

Based on the information presented, I rated the quality of the given hints and pattern as having a value of 9 out of 10 due to the clarity and precision of the conditions and the overall pattern. However, there are no specific rules provided for deciding when an object should keep its current color versus changing it to 9. Therefore, further guidance would improve the precision of the pattern.

Overall, the given conditions and overall pattern appear to be accurate and precise in describing the relationship between the input and output sequences for Examples 1-3.

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are completely contained within other objects of the same color are replaced in the output with a new color (9) while maintaining their position and size.
overall pattern: For every object in the input, check whether it is completely contained within an object of the same color. If so, replace it with a new color (9) while preserving its position and size; otherwise, just change its color to 9.

For all three examples, I rated the value as 8 because although the conditions could be more specific about the color of the objects, they still provide accurate information about the structure of the input. Overall, the given pattern effectively captures the relationship between the input and output sequences in all three examples.

Although the provided pattern appears to accurately represent the relationship between the inputs and outputs, I could not assess its applicability directly using Examples 2 and 3 because they were missing output data. Instead, I evaluated the general correctness of the pattern using Example 1 and assigned a perfect score (9 out of 10) considering the pattern description and conditions. However, I cannot confidently decide if this pattern works well with varying types of inputs due to the lack of additional examples and context.

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:

output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.


transformation steps: ['Iterate through the input sequence.', 'For each element in the sequence, check if it has a value of 5 and if it is part of an object (i.e., it is not a background color).', 'If the current element is part of an object, verify if it is the first element of a contiguous area of color 5 objects.', 'If the current element is the first element of a contiguous area of color 5 objects, initialize a counter to keep track of the number of consecutive color 5 objects.', 'Increment the counter for each consecutive color 5 object found.', 'If the counter reaches a value of 2 or more, indicating that two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5, perform the following replacement step in the output sequence:', 'Replace the colors of the corresponding elements in the output sequence with color 9, while maintaining the same positions and sizes as in the input sequence.']

Analysis:

Step 1: Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
- Pass

Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence elements.
- Pass

Step 3: Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.
- At indices [3, 4, 5, 6]: four consecutive objects with color 5 are found.

Step 4: Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.
- Correctly replaced the color of the four consecutive objects with color 9.

Step 5: Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence.
- Found at positions [3, 4, 5, 6] in both the input and output sequences.
- Size preserved.
- Pass

Step 3: Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.
- At indices [9, 10]: two consecutive objects with color 5 are found.

Step 4: Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.
- Correctly replaced the color of the two consecutive objects with color 9.

Step 5: Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence.
- Found at positions [9, 10] in both the input and output sequences.
- Size preserved.
- Pass

Step 3: Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.
- None found.

Other considerations:
- All other objects with color 5 were left unchanged as expected according to the rules specified in the overall pattern.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the test output as 8 out of 10 since one instance of consecutive objects with color 5 wasn't changed due to being separated by a non-object pixel, but the rest of the transformations followed the described rules accurately.
------
 {"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.", "value": 8}

Analysis:

Step 1: Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
- Passed, since both input and output sequences have the same length.

Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence elements.
- Passed, as evidenced by changes made to the output sequence based on input data.

Step 3: Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.
- Failed: Replacement shouldn't take place when only two consecutive objects of color 5 are encountered; instead, at least three need to be consecutive. This inconsistency is observed in the test output between [5, 5, 0, 5] being changed to [9, 9, 0, 5].

Step 4: Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.
- Partially passed, but see issue noted in Step 3.

Step 5: Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence.
- Passed, since relative positions and spacing of object segments match up between input and output.

Overall, this test output receives a rating of 8 due to incorrectly applying the conditions for replacing objects of color 5 with color 9, though other aspects of the transformation appear correct.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence:

First, we initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence. This seems to be done correctly in the test output.

Next, we iterate through the input sequence elements. Again, this appears to be done correctly in the test output.

Now, we check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5. In the test input, we have three such instances:
- From the fourth to sixth index (5, 5, 5)
- At the ninth index (5)
- From the seventeenth to eighteenth index (5, 5)

Looking at the test output, we see that these instances have been replaced with the color 9 where appropriate according to the overall pattern.

Lastly, we preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence. It appears that this has also been done correctly in the test output.

Overall, the test output appears to correctly apply the described transformation to the test input sequence. I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we see that the initialization step is done correctly since both input and output sequences have the same length. Next, we check each step of the transformation algorithm:

1. Iterating through the input sequence elements - This seems to be correctly implemented because the output contains updated values based on the conditions defined in the problem statement.
2. Checking for two or more consecutive objects with color 5 - This appears to be correct since changes occur primarily around areas with multiple consecutive fives. However, further investigation shows that four consecutive fives at indices 7-10 were treated as separate objects instead of being considered as a single contiguous area. According to our understanding, this should have been identified as a single contiguous area of color 5.
3. Replacing the colors of identified objects with color 9 - Overall, this looks mostly correct but there is an issue related to the second point above. Four consecutive fives at indices 7-10 should have had their colors changed to 9.
4. Preserving the positions and sizes of modified objects - From what we can tell, this has been executed properly.
5. Repeating steps 3-5 till the end of the input sequence - There does not seem to be any problems with repeating these steps.

Now let's summarize and rate the test output sequence based on the analysis:

* Initialization: Correctly implemented
* Step 1: Likely correct implementation
* Step 2: Partially incorrect identification of contiguous areas of color 5
* Step 3: Partially incorrect replacement of certain identifiers due to issues in step 2
* Step 4: Proper handling of preserving position and size
* Step 5: No visible problems with repeated execution

Considering the errors found in identifying and replacing contiguous areas of color 5, we cannot classify the transformation as fully correct. Therefore, I would recommend a rating between 6 and 7 out of 10 for the test output sequence.

Explanation of steps:

   Both input and output sequences have the correct length of 24 (same as the initial input provided)

2. Iterate through the input sequence elements - Pass
   This seems to be done correctly based on the structure of the output

   Consecutive groups of color 5 were identified properly (example: [5,5,5] at indices 6 to 8 became [9,9,9])

4. Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9 - Pass
   Color replacements were made according to the rules defined in the problem statement

5. Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence - Pass
   Position and size of objects were maintained throughout the transformation (example: [5,5,5,5] starting at index 12 was changed to [9,9,9,9] instead of just [9,9] to keep size consistent)

As the test output matches with the expected output and follows the guidelines specified in the transformation algorithm, I would rate it as 10 out of 10.

Value Outputs:

Explanation:

Step 1: Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
- The test output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, so this step is satisfied.

Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence elements.
- By observing the test output sequence, it seems like the algorithm has visited every element since there are changes throughout the sequence.

Step 3: Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.
- We can see that the first four 5s and the next six 5s form consecutive groups of two or more, also at positions 16 and 17. This indicates that the algorithm detected the correct areas.

Step 4: Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.
- Comparing the input and output sequences, we can observe that all consecutive groups of two or more 5s have been successfully changed to 9, which corresponds to the described behavior.

Step 5: Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence.
- Observing the test output sequence, we can confirm that the position and size of each group of 9s correspond exactly to the initial groups of 5s; therefore, this requirement has been fulfilled.

Since the output follows all the expected transformation steps accurately, providing consistent modifications based on the rules provided, I rate the test output sequence as a 10.
------
 {
  "test_output_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, let's evaluate the test input sequence and its corresponding test output sequence:",
  "value": 10
}

Step 1: Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
- Pass

Step 2: Iterate through the input sequence elements.
- Pass

Step 3: Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.
- In this test case, starting at index 4, there are four consecutive objects with color 5, then followed by another object with color 5 at index 8, and finally two more consecutive objects with color 5 starting at index 16. These meet the criterion.

Step 4: Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.
- In this test case, the first group of four consecutive objects with color 5 (starting at index 4) has been replaced with color 9. The next object with color 5 at index 8 remains unchanged since it does not have another consecutive object with color 5. Finally, the last two groups of consecutive objects with color 5 (starting at index 16) have also been replaced with color 9.

Step 5: Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence.
- Based on the test output, this step has been executed accurately.

Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5 until reaching the last element in the input sequence.
- This pass has been achieved successfully throughout the entire input sequence.

Therefore, based on the evaluation and comparison of the provided transformation steps against the test input and output sequences, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10, indicating perfect compliance with the transformation requirements.#############################

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

description:
input: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.
output: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.
overall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.


transformation steps: ['Iterate through the input sequence.', 'For each element in the sequence, check if it has a value of 5 and if it is part of an object (i.e., it is not a background color).', 'If the current element is part of an object, verify if it is the first element of a contiguous area of color 5 objects.', 'If the current element is the first element of a contiguous area of color 5 objects, initialize a counter to keep track of the number of consecutive color 5 objects.', 'Increment the counter for each consecutive color 5 object found.', 'If the counter reaches a value of 2 or more, indicating that two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5, perform the following replacement step in the output sequence:', 'Replace the colors of the corresponding elements in the output sequence with color 9, while maintaining the same positions and sizes as in the input sequence.']

output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
