The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across the input sequences, each object consists of adjacent pixels of the same color value, ranging in size from 1 to 3. In some cases, an object may occupy multiple non-adjacent positions in the sequence.\noutput: Across the output sequences, each object generally consists of adjacent pixels of the same color value, although their sizes and positions may change compared to the input sequence due to various operations including moving, extending, and inserting copies of objects.\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change when there are multiple non-adjacent occurrences of the same object color. When objects appear n times in the input separated by k other elements, they will appear n times in the output separated by k * (L2 - L1) elements, where L1 is the original length of the object and L2 is the final length of the object.\noverall pattern: Given an input sequence with objects A1, A2,..., An, find the final locations of each object based on the initial location Li of each object Ai and the differences in lengths before and after processing:  Move each object to the right by D = (L2 - L1)  (P(Ai+1) - Li).  Place each object at the calculated location. Handle edge cases appropriately to ensure objects remain within bounds.\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\"Example\\_1\": {\"conditions\\_analysis\": \"The given conditions for Example\\_1 state that each object in the input sequence consists of adjacent pixels of the same color value, with sizes ranging from 1 to 3.

Here are my responses for each field:\n\n1. `input_description`: In the test input, there are three distinct objects of color 4. The first object consists of three consecutive pixels at positions 1, 2, and 3; the second object includes a single pixel at position 8; and the third object contains another singlepixel at position 16. There are no other non-background pixels present in this input.\n2. `transformation`:\n   - Step 1: Identify all groups of adjacent objects with the same color that are also adjacent horizontally and vertically.\n     We find three groups of consecutive identical numbers: [4, 4, 4] at positions [1, 2, 3], [4] at position 8, and [4] at position 16. These groups meet the condition of being adjacent both horizontally and vertically since they consist only of horizontal adjacency.\n   - Step 2: Merge these identified groups into larger combined objects.\n     Combining the groups results in one large object that covers positions [1, 2, 3, 8, 16]. This object maintains the original color (4).\n   - Step 3: Handle any potential gaps created by merging.\n     Since the merger involves filling vertical gaps, we need to add zeros at positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,..., 15 to maintain consistency with the provided examples.\n3. `transformed_objects`: In the test output sequence, there would be a single object of color 4, occupying positions 1 through 3 and then skipping positions 4 through 15 before resuming at position 16. This object will span 13 positions in total, accounting for the added zeros during gap handling.\n4. `output`: To generate the final numpy array, here's the code using NumPy:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntest_output = np.array([0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\nWith this answer, you receive a filled-in JSON template containing all relevant information about the transformation of the test input sequence into its corresponding output sequence.#############################\nNext node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

In Examples 1-3, the input consists of separate objects of the same color (consecutive equal numbers), while the output is formed by combining certain objects based on adjacency conditions both horizontally and vertically. These conditions result in merging the input objects into bigger objects with possible gaps appearing due to shifting or removing other objects.\n\nApplying this understanding to the given test case, consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the input sequence was correctly transformed into its output sequence:\n\nStep 1 - Identifying groups of adjacent objects:\nIn the given test input, there are three groups of 4's separated by zeros. According to the conditions, no merging occurs because none of the groups are adjacent both horizontally and vertically.\n\nStep 2 - Merging identified groups:\nSince there are no merged objects after Step 1, there is nothing to do in Step 2.\n\nStep 3 - Handling potential gaps:\nAs there were no merged objects in Step 1, there are no gaps to handle in Step 3.\n\nComparing the results of the test case to the expected outcome, it seems like the transformation wasn't applied at all. The test output shows that the second group of 4's has been replaced by zeros. Hence, based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as 1 out of 10, indicating that the given output did not follow the provided transformation rules.\n------\n Based on the analysis of the given transformation algorithm and the test input-output pair, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Considering the first step, Identify all groups of adjacent objects with the same color that are also adjacent horizontally and vertically, the input sequence contains three such groups - one at positions 1 to 3, another at position 10, and the last at positions 16 to 18.

Lastly, Handle any potential gaps created by merging; however, there are no gaps left by merging objects in this case. Comparing the given test output against the expected result based on the transformation steps, it seems that no merging took place. This suggests that either the identification of the groups did not occur properly or the merging process failed.\",\n    \"value\": \"5\"\n}\n```\n\nIn conclusion, based on the transformation steps provided, the test output does not appear to be correct since the merging of adjacent objects based on the described conditions did not happen.

However, it's worth noting that the test output contains gaps where merging could occur, but it did not happen as expected.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the test output sequence seems incorrect because none of the groups of consecutive fours were merged even though they meet the specified conditions. Therefore, I would rate the test output a value of 2 out of 10, accounting for identifying the groups but failing to apply the merging transformation.\n\nResult:\n{\n\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n\"value\": 2\n}\n------\n Based on the given input-output pairs and their shared transformation pattern, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify all groups of adjacent objects with the same color that are also adjacent horizontally and vertically:\n1. Group 1: [4, 4, 4] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3\n2. Group 2: [4] starting at index 8 and ending at index 8\n3. Group 3: [4] starting at index 14 and ending at index 14\n4. Group 4: [4] starting at index 20 and ending at index 20\n\nNext, we merge these identified groups into larger combined objects:\n1. Output Group 1: [4, 4, 4] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3\n2. Output Group 2: [4] starting at index 8 and ending at index 8\n3. Output Group 3: [4] starting at index 14 and ending at index 14\n4. Output Group 4: [4] starting at index 20 and ending at index 20\n\nFinally, there are no gaps created by merging, so no additional processing is needed.\n\nComparing the test input and test output shows that the test output matches the test input exactly. This suggests that either the test input already satisfies the overall pattern conditions without requiring further changes, or the transformation algorithm failed to apply any required modifications to produce the expected output. However, based on the instructions provided in the example, it appears that no modification occurred during the transformation process.\n\nAs a result, I cannot validate whether the algorithm itself functions properly since it did not modify the input in this particular test case. Nevertheless, the test output does match the input in terms of structure and content, so my evaluation would rate the test output as correct based solely on that comparison.\n\n{\n\t\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n\t\"value\": 10\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

The objects are [Object_1: {color: 4, start\\_index: 1, end\\_index: 3, size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 4, start\\_index: 8, end\\_index: 8, size: 1}, Object_3: {color: 4, start\\_index: 14, end\\_index: 14, size: 1}, Object_4: {color: 4, start\\_index: 26, end\\_index: 26, size: 1}].\n\nNext, we follow the second transformation step to check if any objects are part of a larger contiguous group. However, in this test case, there are no such groups.\n\nThen, since there are no larger contiguous groups, we proceed to the third transformation step. We see that Objects 2, 3, and 4 are disconnected from other objects in the input, but they maintain their properties in the output.\n\nLastly, we examine the fourth transformation step to ensure that each object in the output corresponds to its original locations in the input. From our evaluation, every instance of 4 appears to match those present in the input.\n\nHowever, considering the overall pattern described earlier, one discrepancy emerges. According to the description provided, objects changing when their continuous region is broken down in the input do not seem to apply here. Instead, the test output combines Objects 1 and 2 even though they were separated in the input. This behavior contradicts the stated condition of connecting objects based on larger contiguous groups while preserving their properties. Therefore, despite accurately handling individual objects, the overall pattern has not been followed entirely.\n\nAs a result, I would rate the test output as 7 out of 10 because most of the steps were performed correctly; however, the combination of Objects 1 and 2 violates the conditions outlined in the problem statement.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. While most steps appeared to be implemented appropriately, combining objects 1 and 2 does not adhere to the overall pattern specified in the problem statement.', 'value': 7}\n------\n Here's the evaluation of the provided test output sequence:\n\n1. **Step 1**: The input has three main objects with color 4 at indices `[1, 3], [10], [23]`. These objects match the description of being adjacent pixels of the same color, and they do not occupy multiple non-adjacent positions.\n    - *Verdict*: Correctly processed.\n2. **Step 2**: Since there are no larger contiguous groups of color 4, this step does not apply.\n    - *Verdict*: N/A.\n3. **Step 3**: Each object of color 4 is treated as a single instance and preserved in the output.\n    - *Verdict*: Correctly processed.\n4. **Step 4**: Ensuring that each object in the output corresponds to its original location(s) in the input. However, comparing the input and output, we see differences in the locations where color 4 appears:\n    - Input: Indices `[1, 2, 3], [10], [23]`\n    - Output: Indices `[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8], [15]`\n    This deviates from the described overall pattern. It seems like instead of maintaining correspondence with the original locations, new locations were created based on proximity to other instances of the object.\n    - *Verdict*: Incorrect processing.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I would rate the test output as a `1`, meaning it significantly differs from our expected result based on the provided information.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 1\n}\n```\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Here's how it looks for our test input:\n```\nObjects:\n- Color: 4\n  Instances:\n    - Pixels: [4, 4, 4]\n      Location: [1, 3]\n    - Pixels: [4]\n      Location: [10]\n    - Pixels: [4]\n      Location: [16]\n    - Pixels: [4]\n      Location: [22]\n```\n\n2. **For each identified object, check if it is part of a larger contiguous group. Connect these objects accordingly in the output, preserving color, position, and size.**\nWe do not observe any connection conditions met in the test input, so no changes are made during this step.\n\n3. **If an object is disconnected from others in the input, treat it as a single instance and preserve its properties (color, position, and size) in the output.**\nAgain, since there are no disconnected objects in the test input, no changes are needed.\n\n4. **Ensure that each object in the output corresponds to its original location(s) in the input.**\nAs per the test output, let us compare the results with the expected output.\n\n| Input | Output        |\n|---    | ---          |\n| `4`   | `4 4 4`      |\n| `4`   | `4 4 4`      |\n| `4`   | `4 4 4`      |\n| `0`   | `0 0 0`      |\n| `4`   | `4 4 4`      |\n| `0`   | `0 0 0`      |\n|...   |...          |\n\nIt appears that every occurrence of color 4 has been replaced with three consecutive fours `4 4 4`. This transformation contradicts the third and fourth transformation steps as it alters the properties of several instances. We would expect separate instances to remain unaltered, like in Example\\_1 from the input-output pairs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*test\\_output\\_analysis*: Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. During the first step, we correctly identified the objects based on their color values. However, the resulting output violates the last two transformation steps, significantly changing the properties of individual instances.\n\n*value*: 2\n------\n Here's the JSON response for the test output analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm to analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\\n\\nStep 1: Identifying objects in the input sequence.\\nInput has two objects with color 4: [{color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}, {color: 4, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}, {color: 4, start_index: 16, end_index: 16, size: 1}, {color: 4, start_index: 22, end_index: 22, size: 1}]\\n\\nStep 2: Connecting contiguous objects in the output.\\nThere is one contiguous group of objects: [{color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 3, size: 3}, {color: 4, start_index: 8, end_index: 8, size: 1}, {color: 4, start_index: 16, end_index: 18, size: 3}].
