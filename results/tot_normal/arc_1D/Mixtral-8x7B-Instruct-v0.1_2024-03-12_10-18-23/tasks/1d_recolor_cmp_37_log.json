The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': \"based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size?

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across these examples, the number of objects and their sizes vary, however each object consists of the same single color (5), sometimes even appearing multiple times in a sequence. Additionally, there is no apparent relation between adjacent objects, nor any noise pixels present.\noutput: Although every input sequence results in an identical number of objects post-transformation, some variations occur depending on how objects relate to one another pre-transformation. In cases where an object of color 5 is entirely encompassed by another object of the same color resulting in a larger object, it gets replaced with an object having a new color (9). Otherwise, the original object simply switches color to 9 without changing its size or spatial properties.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change color when two or more consecutive objects with color 5 result in a larger contiguous area of color 5 in the input sequence.\noverall pattern: For any input containing objects with color 5, iterate through the elements checking if two or more consecutive objects form a larger contiguous area of color 5. If so, replace the inner objects' colors with color 9 while preserving the position and size of those objects in the output sequence.\n\n\ntransformation steps: [{'step': 'Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.', 'explanation': 'To ensure proper indexing during the transformation process, we create an output sequence with the same dimensions as the input sequence.'}, {'step': 'Iterate through the input sequence elements.', 'explanation': 'We will examine each element individually to identify the presence of consecutive objects with color 5.'}, {'step': 'Check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5.', 'explanation': 'If two or more consecutive objects with color 5 are found, they form a larger contiguous area.'}, {'step': 'Replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.', 'explanation': 'In order to satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description, we need to replace the color of the identified objects with color 9.'}, {'step': 'Preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence.', 'explanation': 'It is essential to maintain the integrity of the objects, including their position and size, before and after replacement.'}, {'step': 'Repeat steps 3-5 until reaching the last element in the input sequence.', 'explanation': 'By processing the entire input sequence, we make sure that all instances of consecutive objects with color 5 are accounted for and processed accordingly.'}]\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n {'input_description': 'The test input contains four objects with color 5.

This seems to be done correctly in the test output.\n\nNext, we iterate through the input sequence elements. Again, this appears to be done correctly in the test output.\n\nNow, we check for two or more consecutive objects with color 5. In the test input, we have three such instances:\n- From the fourth to sixth index (5, 5, 5)\n- At the ninth index (5)\n- From the seventeenth to eighteenth index (5, 5)\n\nLooking at the test output, we see that these instances have been replaced with the color 9 where appropriate according to the overall pattern.\n\nLastly, we preserve the position and size of the modified objects in the output sequence. It appears that this has also been done correctly in the test output.\n\nOverall, the test output appears to correctly apply the described transformation to the test input sequence. I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we see that the initialization step is done correctly since both input and output sequences have the same length. Next, we check each step of the transformation algorithm:\n\n1. Iterating through the input sequence elements - This seems to be correctly implemented because the output contains updated values based on the conditions defined in the problem statement.\n2. Checking for two or more consecutive objects with color 5 - This appears to be correct since changes occur primarily around areas with multiple consecutive fives. However, further investigation shows that four consecutive fives at indices 7-10 were treated as separate objects instead of being considered as a single contiguous area. According to our understanding, this should have been identified as a single contiguous area of color 5.\n3. Replacing the colors of identified objects with color 9 - Overall, this looks mostly correct but there is an issue related to the second point above. Four consecutive fives at indices 7-10 should have had their colors changed to 9.\n4. Preserving the positions and sizes of modified objects - From what we can tell, this has been executed properly.\n5. Repeating steps 3-5 till the end of the input sequence - There does not seem to be any problems with repeating these steps.\n\nNow let's summarize and rate the test output sequence based on the analysis:\n\n* Initialization: Correctly implemented\n* Step 1: Likely correct implementation\n* Step 2: Partially incorrect identification of contiguous areas of color 5\n* Step 3: Partially incorrect replacement of certain identifiers due to issues in step 2\n* Step 4: Proper handling of preserving position and size\n* Step 5: No visible problems with repeated execution\n\nConsidering the errors found in identifying and replacing contiguous areas of color 5, we cannot classify the transformation as fully correct. Therefore, I would recommend a rating between 6 and 7 out of 10 for the test output sequence.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\\n\\nStep 2: Partially incorrect identification of contiguous areas of color 5\\nStep 3: Partially incorrect replacement of certain identifiers due to issues in step 2', 'value': 6}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
