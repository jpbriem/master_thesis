#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    "output": "Output sequences typically have fewer objects, but they may be larger in size compared to their respective inputs. Some objects from the input might disappear in the output or get combined with others."
  }
}
```
Commonalities within input sequences include having multiple separate objects, where an object is defined as a group of connected pixels with the same color. Input sequences can also include noise pixels (0), separating or surrounding these objects. In some instances, multiple small objects from the input may be merged into a single larger object in the output sequence.

 Here is the JSON response you requested:
```json
{
    "Example_1": {
        "input_analysis": "Regarding the first example, the given input description is not present since there is no description provided. However, the concept of connected components (objects) is covered by the input data itself. It would be helpful to specify that the input describes a sequence where each object consists of consecutive identical numbers. The description could also mention that the objects can be separated by any number of zeros.",
        "output_analysis": "Regarding the first example, the given output description does not fit well because it does not explain what causes the changes in the output. A good description should mention that the output is obtained by filling gaps between original objects with their respective colors when those gaps do not exceed some maximum length (e.g., one).",
        "value": "3"
    },
    "Example_2": {
        "input_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the input description is not provided in this case either. As before, the concept of connected components is implicitly represented in the input data. Specifying how the input data encodes connected components would improve understanding.",
        "output_analysis": "In contrast to Example_1, the output description here is more precise. It specifies filling gaps up to certain lengths based on the original colors, making it clear how the output differs from the input. To make it even better, we could add a clause about handling cases when gaps are larger than the specified maximum length.",
        "value": "7"
    },
    "Example_3": {
        "input_analysis": "Again, there is no explicit input description provided. It would benefit readers to explicitly state the connection between nonzero numbers indicating connected components.",
        "output_analysis": "The output description seems appropriate, covering gap filling as previously described, but without an explanation for longer gaps.",
        "value": "3"
    }
}
```
Overall, none of the examples had explicit descriptions, and important information was missing such as the role of connected components and handling long gaps. In general, I rated the descriptions at around 3 out of 10 due to these shortcomings. Improving them to include comprehensive explanations should yield better ratings.
------
 Based on the given input-output pairs, here's the analysis for each example:

Example_1:
input_analysis: The given input description doesn't provide any specific information about what to expect from the inputs. However, it does follow the general pattern that when there is more than one consecutive series of identical numbers (in this case, 2s), their leading zeros will be removed in the output. Therefore, the description may not be informative, but it is accurate for this example.

output_analysis: Again, no specific description is provided, but the output follows the observed pattern of preserving the first occurrence of a series of identical numbers while removing the leading zeros from subsequent identical number series. This behavior is consistent across all three examples, so the description can be seen as fitting even though it isn't detailed.

value: 6 - While both descriptions do apply to these examples, they don't offer much insight because they lack specificity. A better description would include the actual rule being applied rather than leaving it up to the reader to infer based on the examples.

---

This structure applies to other examples too:

Example_2:
input_analysis: Same as Example_1 since the same pattern holds true for consecutive 8s.

output_analysis: Same as Example_1 since the same pattern holds true for consecutive 8s.

Example_3:
input_analysis: Same as previous examples, now applicable to 3s.

output_analysis: Same as previous examples, now applicable to 3s.

Overall, while the descriptions match the observed patterns, they could be improved by explicitly stating those patterns instead of relying solely on the reader to deduce them from the examples.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

Both the input and output descriptions accurately represent Examples 1, 2, and 3. However, the value ratings might vary based on how strictly you interpret the requirement for covering all relevant commonalities. A minor concern is that the descriptions do not explicitly mention handling cases where no objects exist or when objects consist of only one element. Nevertheless, since these situations don't occur in the provided examples, I gave relatively high scores.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size?

Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

description:
input: Across all input sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. When multiple objects of the same color exist, they may be separated by regions of noise pixels (0) but never overlap with each other.
output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. When multiple objects of the same color exist, they may be separated by regions of noise pixels (0) but never overlap with each other.
output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: When two or more objects of the same color are far apart in the input, they will likely stay separate in the output. However, when they are close together, they tend to merge in the output.
Objects near the edges may shift their positions towards the beginning or end of the sequence according to surrounding noise pixels (0).
Noise pixels (0) around objects may cause them to maintain their position and size, or even grow in size.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, search for objects of the same color. Analyze their positions and distances from each other. If they are far apart, leave them unchanged in the output. If they are close, consider merging them in the output based on their colors. Check the positions of objects related to the background pixels (0); objects near the edges may shift their positions accordingly.
Specifically, determine the color, position, and size of each output object based on these conditions and the original input object properties.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. When multiple objects of the same color exist, they may be separated by regions of noise pixels (0) but never overlap with each other.
output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their relative positions cause them to merge in the output. Merging depends on the proximity of objects with the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input, create a single contiguous region for each set of proximate objects with the same color. Maintain the original color for all objects. This ensures the correct merging of objects in the output.

For Example\_2 and Example\_3, since they follow the same input-output pattern and conditions mentioned in the description, they will also receive a similar analysis like Example\_1.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, each sequence contains multiple objects composed of consecutive pixels with the same color value. Each object may appear multiple times throughout the sequence, possibly separated by noise pixels (pixels with a color value of 0).
output: Across all output sequences, each sequence contains one object composed of consecutive pixels with the same color value. This object appears once in the sequence and spans across any initial noise pixels present in the corresponding input sequence, absorbing them.


overall pattern:
conditions: If objects sharing a common color value are separated by noise pixels, they will merge in the output. If objects are directly adjacent, they maintain adjacency in the output.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, search for groups of objects sharing a common color value. Merge those objects separated by noise pixels, ensuring to keep intact contiguous runs of pixels connected through adjacent objects. Keep track of the smallest and largest non-zero indices to specify the final object location in the output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. When multiple objects of the same color exist, they may be separated by regions of noise pixels (0) but never overlap with each other.
output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their relative positions cause them to merge in the output. Merging depends on the proximity of objects with the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input, create a single contiguous region for each set of proximate objects with the same color. Maintain the original color for all objects. This ensures the correct merging of objects in the output.

Explanation:

The transformation involves identifying objects of the same color, grouping them together, and then creating a single contiguous region for each group of proximate objects with the same color. By doing this, we can ensure that objects will only merge if they are proximate to each other in the input sequence. Additionally, we maintain the original color for all objects in the output sequence. We achieve this by first identifying all objects in the input sequence and grouping them by color (Step 1). Next, we sort the groups of objects by their starting index in the input sequence (Step 2), so we can process them in order. Then, we iterate through each group of objects, checking if the current object and the next object are adjacent and have the same color (Steps 3-5). If they are, we update the end\_index of the current object to include the next object. Otherwise, we add the current object to the new output sequence and repeat the process until all objects have been added (Step 6). Finally, we add any remaining noise pixels at the end of the input sequence to the output sequence (Step 7).

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. When multiple objects of the same color exist, they may be separated by regions of noise pixels (0) but never overlap with each other.
output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: When two or more objects of the same color are far apart in the input, they will likely stay separate in the output. However, when they are close together, they tend to merge in the output.
Objects near the edges may shift their positions towards the beginning or end of the sequence according to surrounding noise pixels (0).
Noise pixels (0) around objects may cause them to maintain their position and size, or even grow in size.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, search for objects of the same color. Analyze their positions and distances from each other. If they are far apart, leave them unchanged in the output. If they are close, consider merging them in the output based on their colors. Check the positions of objects related to the background pixels (0); objects near the edges may shift their positions accordingly.
Specifically, determine the color, position, and size of each output object based on these conditions and the original input object properties.

Value Outputs:
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

Example\_1:
transformation\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify and merge the proximate objects of color 2 into a single contiguous region. However, the steps also incorrectly modify the noise pixels (0) between the objects of color 2. According to the description, noise pixels should remain unchanged.
value: 7

Example\_2:
transformation\_analysis: Similar to Example\_1, the transformation steps accurately merge the proximate objects of color 8 while also preserving the color of the objects. Yet, once again, the steps inappropriately alter the noise pixels (0).
value: 7

Example\_3:
transformation\_analysis: In this example, the transformation steps appropriately handle the objects of color 3, maintaining their color and merging them when necessary. Nevertheless, the steps still erroneously modify the noise pixels (0), despite instructions indicating otherwise.
value: 7

Overall, the given transformation steps successfully identify and merge proximate objects of the same color. However, these steps fail to adhere to the last step mentioned in the instructions, resulting in inconsistencies related to preserving noise pixels (0). Therefore, although the primary objective of the transformation steps is achieved, there is room for improvement in remaining faithful to the complete list of requirements.
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

Example\_1:
transformation\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify the set of proximate objects with the same color (two instances of color 2). They also successfully combine the objects in each set while maintaining the first object's position and replacing them with a single contiguous region of the same color. Noise pixels (0) remain unchanged throughout the process. Based on this analysis, the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
value: 10

Example\_2:
transformation\_analysis: Similar to Example\_1, the transformation steps accurately identify and combine the proximate objects with the same color (eight instances of color 8). These steps ensure that the first object's position is maintained, and noise pixels (0) stay unaltered. As a result, the transformation steps correctly convert the input sequence into its output sequence.
value: 10

Example\_3:
transformation\_analysis: In this example, the transformation steps recognize the proximate objects with the same color (three instances of color 3) and merge them while keeping the initial object's position. The steps do not affect noise pixels (0), ensuring that the input sequence is transformed into the desired output sequence.
value: 10

Overall, the provided transformation steps adequately capture the underlying pattern in all three examples. By identifying proximate objects with the same color and combining them appropriately, these steps produce the expected results without modifying the noise pixels (0). Therefore, the transformation steps receive a perfect score of 10 for each example.#############################

overall pattern:
conditions: When two or more objects of the same color are far apart in the input, they will likely stay separate in the output. However, when they are close together, they tend to merge in the output.
Objects near the edges may shift their positions towards the beginning or end of the sequence according to surrounding noise pixels (0).
Noise pixels (0) around objects may cause them to maintain their position and size, or even grow in size.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, search for objects of the same color. Analyze their positions and distances from each other. If they are far apart, leave them unchanged in the output. If they are close, consider merging them in the output based on their colors. Check the positions of objects related to the background pixels (0); objects near the edges may shift their positions accordingly.

conditions: When two or more objects of the same color are far apart in the input, they will likely stay separate in the output. However, when they are close together, they tend to merge in the output.
Objects near the edges may shift their positions towards the beginning or end of the sequence according to surrounding noise pixels (0).
Noise pixels (0) around objects may cause them to maintain their position and size, or even grow in size.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence, search for objects of the same color. Analyze their positions and distances from each other. If they are far apart, leave them unchanged in the output. If they are close, consider merging them in the output based on their colors. Check the positions of objects related to the background pixels (0); objects near the edges may shift their positions accordingly.
Specifically, determine the color, position, and size of each output object based on these conditions and the original input object properties.

In general, the provided transformation steps accurately describe the process required to transform the input sequences into their respective output sequences. By identifying and segmenting the input sequence into individual objects based on color, analyzing the positions and distances between objects of the same color, and reconstructing the output sequence using the updated objects, we can ensure that the final output sequence reflects the desired changes described in the overall pattern. Additionally, the inclusion of specific steps to handle edge cases and potential shifts due to noise pixels helps ensure the accuracy of the transformation.

Overall, I would rate the transformation steps as highly effective in accurately describing the transformation for all examples.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. When multiple objects of the same color exist, they may be separated by regions of noise pixels (0) but never overlap with each other.
output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their relative positions cause them to merge in the output. Merging depends on the proximity of objects with the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input, create a single contiguous region for each set of proximate objects with the same color. Maintain the original color for all objects. This ensures the correct merging of objects in the output.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we need to identify sets of proximate objects with the same color (Step 1):

Input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

We can see two groups of consecutive threes at the beginning and one group near the end of the sequence. There are also some isolated threes towards the end, which means they do not form a contiguous region with others.

Calculate the starting index, ending index, and total size of the combined regions (Step 2):

* Group 1: Index range [1, 16]; Size = 16
* Group 2: Index range [31, 31]; Size = 1

Create a new output sequence where each set of proximate objects with the same color is represented as a single contiguous region (Step 3):

Output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Since the input and output sequences are identical, this implies that the identified sets of proximate objects were already in a single contiguous region in the input itself. Therefore, filling any gaps between merged objects isn't necessary in this case (Step 4).

After analyzing each step of the transformation algorithm, we conclude that the test input sequence was not transformed since there weren't any changes made to produce the test output sequence. Providing the exact same input and output sequences does not demonstrate whether the transformation algorithm works correctly.

Therefore, based on the provided examples and instructions, I cannot give a rating for the test output because it doesn't showcase the application of the described transformation process. To accurately assess the implementation and performance of the algorithm, we would need appropriate input and output sequences demonstrating how the algorithm modifies the initial data according to the specified rules.

{'test_output_analysis': 'The test output sequence did not demonstrate the correct application of the transformation steps, as it provided the exact same sequence as input without modifications.', 'value': 'N/A'}
------
 Based on the given problem statement, we will evaluate the test output sequence against the provided transformation steps and the overall pattern.

First, let's analyze the test input and output sequences to see if they meet the conditions specified in the description section:

1. Test input does contain single contiguous regions for each object with no overlapping.
2. Test output also contains single contiguous regions for each object with no overlapping.

Now, let's compare the test input and output sequences based on the overall pattern and transformation steps:

Overall Pattern:
Given input, create a single contiguous region for each set of proximate objects with the same color. Maintain the original color for all objects.

Transformation Steps:

Step 1: Identify sets of proximate objects with the same color.
- In the test input, there are two sets of proximate objects with the same color (3): one at the beginning (indices 1-15) and another towards the end (indices 26-28, 33-35).
- In the test output, these objects are still grouped in the same way, so this condition is satisfied.

Step 2: Calculate the starting index, ending index, and total size of the combined region.
- Since the test output remains unchanged compared to the test input, this information can be assumed to be the same.

Step 3: Create a new output sequence where each set of proximate objects with the same color is represented as a single contiguous region.
- As mentioned before, the test output remains unchanged, meaning that this step is technically satisfied since the input itself already features single contiguous regions for the groups of proximate objects. However, if the purpose of the transformation is to ensure that adjacent identical objects are merged into a single contiguous region, then this step would require modifying the test input to remove the gap between indices 15 and 26.

Step 4: Fill any gaps between the merged objects in the output sequence with noise pixels (0), ensuring that each set of merged objects forms a single contiguous region.
- Again, as the test output remains unchanged, this step cannot truly be evaluated since there are no gaps being filled with noise pixels.

After analyzing the given test input and output sequences, we notice that the test output doesn't seem to follow the intended transformation pattern. While the input and output sequences do adhere to the general conditions outlined in the problem description, neither the test input nor the test output appears to have undergone any changes related to the specific transformation steps. Specifically, the expected result of combining proximate objects of the same color into a single contiguous region isn't observed in the test output.

Therefore, our evaluation is as follows:

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was not correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Though the input and output adhere to the given conditions, the transformation steps themselves were not implemented properly as the input and output remain unchanged.', 'value': '3'}

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the expected transformation pattern and the given test input sequence.

1. Step 1: In the test input sequence, we can identify two sets of proximate objects with the same color - one set containing seven '3's at the beginning and another set containing four '3's towards the end. Both sets meet the condition of having no noise pixels (0) between them.

2. Step 2: For the first set, the starting index is 1, the ending index is 7, and the total size is 7. For the second set, the starting index is 16, the ending index is 19, and the total size is 4.

3. Step 3: The creation of the new output sequence results in a single contiguous region for each set of proximate objects with the same color. However, the output sequence does not maintain the required structure of starting with noise pixels (0) and ending with noise pixels (0), since it merges the sets without introducing any padding zeros.

4. Step 4: Since the new output sequence combines the sets of proximate objects without leaving any gaps, this step isn't applicable.

In conclusion, while the test output sequence applies some parts of the transformation correctly, such as identifying and merging proximate objects based on color, it fails to preserve the required output structure described in Step 3. Therefore, the test output sequence cannot be confirmed as being generated using the given transformation process accurately.

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was not correctly transformed into the test output sequence due to failing to maintain the required output structure with noise pixels separating merged objects.', 'value': '5'}
------
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output sequence:

The transformation seems to have been applied correctly according to the given steps. However, there is one discrepancy in the test output sequence:

Input sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Test output sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In the test output sequence, at the position corresponding to the second group of 3s in the input sequence, there is a merge of two 3s. But this merge does not seem to respect the rule mentioned in the overall pattern section: "If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence." Here, the first group of 3s did not move closer together before merging; instead, they merged with the second group of 3s that were further away. Therefore, despite the fact that the transformation was generally applied correctly, this specific step violates the overall pattern's conditions.

As a result, I would rate the test output as follows:

{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
  "value": 6
}

While most of the transformation was done accurately, a crucial part of it failed to meet the overall pattern's criteria.

 Based on the given examples, description, overall pattern, and transformation steps, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

The test input sequence consists of two distinct regions of identical color (3) separated by noise pixels (0). In this case, no merging occurs based on the proximity condition mentioned in the overall pattern. Therefore, the expected output would maintain these separate regions without changing their locations.

Given the test output sequence remains unchanged compared to the test input sequence, we can analyze how well it adheres to the provided transformation steps:

1. Identify sets of proximate objects with the same color - No action needed since there are no gaps between the proximate objects of color 3.

2. Calculate the starting index, ending index, and total size - Also unnecessary because of the previous reason.

3. Create a new output sequence - Unnecessary here as well due to the absence of changes required.

4. Fill any gaps between the merged objects - Not applicable since there were no merges performed.

Since none of the transformation steps required modifications, observing that the test output remained unaltered is consistent with the given rules. Thus, I conclude that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify sets of proximate objects with the same color (Step 1):
- Set 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- Set 2: [3]
- Set 3: [3]

Next, for each set of proximate objects with the same color, we calculate the starting index, ending index, and total size of the combined region (Step 2):
- Set 1: start=1, end=16, size=15
- Set 2: start=31, end=31, size=1
- Set 3: start=34, end=34, size=1

We then create a new output sequence where each set of proximate objects with the same color is represented as a single contiguous region, preserving the original color, ensuring that the output sequence starts with noise pixels (0), followed by the merged objects and ends with noise pixels (0) (Step 3):
Output = [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Finally, we fill any gaps between the merged objects in the output sequence with noise pixels (0), ensuring that each set of merged objects forms a single contiguous region (Step 4):
Final Output = [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Comparing the final output to the test output, we see they match exactly. Therefore, based on the transformation algorithm, the test output sequence seems to be generated correctly from the test input sequence. Considering all steps, our analysis suggests a rating of 10 for the test output.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given input-output pairs and the description of the transformation, I will evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, let's identify the sets of proximate objects with the same color in the input sequence:

1. Set 1: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] (length = 16)
2. Set 2: [3] (length = 1)
3. Set 3: [3] (length = 1)

Now, let's apply the transformation steps to this input sequence:

Transformation Step 1: Identified the sets of proximate objects with the same color.

Transformation Step 2: Calculate the starting index, ending index, and total size of the combined region for each set:

1. Set 1: start=1, end=17, size=16
2. Set 2: start=33, end=33, size=1
3. Set 3: start=35, end=35, size=1

Transformation Step 3: Create a new output sequence where each set of proximate objects with the same color is represented as a single contiguous region, maintaining the order and preserving the original color:

Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Transformation Step 4: There are no gaps between the merged objects, so no need to fill gaps with noise pixels.

Given the provided test input and output along with the described transformation, we can observe that the output does not match our expected result based on the transformation rules. Specifically, the two separate instances of object 3 in the input should remain as distinct, non-merged objects in the output. Thus, the given test output seems incorrect.

Based on the analysis, the rating for the test output would be 2 out of 10 since it fails to follow the specified transformation rules.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence. First, let's apply the given transformation steps on the test input sequence:

Input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Applying steps 1-6, we get the following object regions stored in a dictionary:
{3: (1, 15)}

Applying steps 7-9, we notice that there is only one color present in this input sequence, so no combination of regions is needed.

Now applying step 10, we overwrite the input sequence with the single contiguous region for the color 3:
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0] becomes
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Since this is the exact same sequence, no actual transformation occurred. Therefore, comparing the test output sequence (None) to our result shows us that the test output does not match the expected output. It seems like the transformation wasn't correctly applied to the test input sequence.

```json
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",

}
```

Explanation:

Since no test output was provided, we cannot verify if the transformation was applied correctly. However, based on the available information, let's go through the steps assuming the test output were provided.

1. Empty dictionary initialization - Assumed to be done correctly.
2. Iterate through the input sequence - Assumed to be done correctly.
3. Handling noise pixels - Assumed to be done correctly.
4. Checking current_object assignment - Assumed to be done correctly.
5. Extending regions with matching colors - Assumed to be done correctly.
6. Adding new objects to the dictionary - Assumed to be done correctly.
7. Obtain a list of unique colors - Assumed to be done correctly.
8. Retrieve non-overlapping region information - Assumed to be done correctly.
9. Combine regions with multiple proximate objects - Assumed to be done correctly.
10. Overwrite the input sequence with combined regions - Assumed to be done correctly.

However, without the actual test output, we cannot determine if the last step was executed correctly. Based on the assumptions, the process seems fine, but without verifying the result, we cannot provide a meaningful rating.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the problem description and the provided examples, the goal is to identify connected components of the same color in the input sequence and ensure that they remain connected in the output sequence. Here's how I would approach analyzing the test output sequence:

First, let's apply the transformation steps manually to the test input sequence:

Test Input Sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Step 1-3: Empty dictionary, no current object yet.
Step 4-6: Set `current_object` to {color: 3, start_index: 1, end_index: 14}. Add the new object to the dictionary.
Step 7: We have one color (3) in the input.
Step 8: Retrieve the object information for the color 3: {start_index: 1, end_index: 14}.
Step 9: No need to perform combining since there's only one object with color 3.
Step 10-11: Replace the input sequence with the updated object information, resulting in the test output sequence: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0].

So the Test Output Sequence is equal to the expected result based on the manual application of the transformation steps.

Now, let's evaluate the test output sequence:

{'test_output_analysis': 'All transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input sequence, leading to the formation of a single contiguous region for each group of proximate objects with the same color.', 'value': 10}

Since the expected output is `None`, this indicates that the test input sequence should remain unchanged after applying the transformation. However, based on the provided input and the described transformation steps, the input sequence contains proximate objects with the same color (3), and Step 10 states that these regions should be combined into a single contiguous region. Therefore, even though the actual output isn't provided, the described transformation process suggests that the test input sequence should have been altered, contradicting the expectation of having no changes. As a result, I cannot provide a positive rating; instead, I had to assign a value of 0.

output: Across all output sequences, every object has a single contiguous region. If an object exists in both the input and output, its location may change, and it could potentially merge with another object of the same color, depending on their relative positions in the input sequence.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their relative positions cause them to merge in the output. Merging depends on the proximity of objects with the same color.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided transformation steps and the description of the examples, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we follow Step 1 and initialize an empty dictionary to store non-overlapping object regions. Then, we iterate through the input sequence (Step 2). As we process the input, we keep track of the current_object (Step 3). We notice that there are no noise pixels (0) in this test case, so current\_object remains unchanged throughout the iteration.

Next, since the first five elements are all of color 3, they will form a group with one start index and one end index. By the time we reach the last three 3's at the end of the sequence, we would have updated our dictionary with `{3: (0, 16)}`.

Now, moving forward to Step 7, we get the unique colors present in the input: `{3}`. Continuing with Step 8, we retrieve the non-overlapping region information for this color from the dictionary: `(0, 16)`. Unfortunately, according to Step 9, we do not need to combine any regions because there are no multiple proximate objects with the same color. However, upon reaching the last step (Step 10), we find a discrepancy between the expected and actual results.

In the test output, instead of having one large region containing all the 3's, we observe two separate regions: one from indices 0 to 16 and another from 17 to 31. It appears that the algorithm did not handle cases where previously processed adjacent objects reappear later in the input sequence.

Given this observation, I cannot consider the transformation as being applied correctly to the test input sequence. Therefore, I am unable to provide a numeric rating based on the presented information.

{'test_output_analysis': 'The given test output does not adhere to the described pattern; therefore, it seems that the transformation was not correctly applied to the test input sequence.', 'value': -1}
------
 Based on the provided input-output pairs and the described transformation pattern, we can see that the goal is to merge proximate objects of the same color into a single contiguous region while maintaining the original color of the objects. The transformation steps outline a process for achieving this by first identifying non-overlapping object regions, combining regions for proximate objects of the same color, and then overwriting the input sequence with these combined regions.

Applying these steps to the test input sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], we observe that it does not match the expected test output sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]. Specifically, at the end of the input sequence, there are two separate objects with color 3 instead of one continuous region as in the expected output. Upon examining the transformation steps, there doesn't seem to be any issue with the logic. However, the discrepancy suggests that either an error occurred during the implementation of the steps or the provided test output sequence is incorrect.

To provide a more accurate assessment, it would be ideal to review the actual implemented code and identify whether there are any issues causing the unexpected result. Nonetheless, based on the available information, I cannot confidently rate the quality of the test output sequence. Performing additional testing with alternative input sequences might help reveal potential problems with the implementation or clarify ambiguities related to the test output sequence.

{'test_output_analysis': 'Inconclusive; unable to determine whether the provided test output sequence was generated using the described transformation algorithm due to the discrepancy between the expected test output and the observed result. Further examination of the implementation and additional tests are recommended.', 'value': -1}

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation steps and patterns, we will evaluate the test output sequence.

First, let's go over the description provided for the input and output sequences:
- Each object has a single contiguous region in both the input and output.
- Multiple objects of the same color can be separated by noise pixels (0) in the input, but this might not be the case in the output where merged objects form larger contiguous regions.

Now, let's examine the test case:

Input: `[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]`
Output: `[0, 3, 3,..., 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0,..., 0, 3, 0, 0]`

It appears that some of the merged objects maintain their combined length while others do not follow this rule. Let's go over the transformation steps and see how well the test output fits the expected result.

1. An empty dictionary is initialized.
2. We iterate through the input sequence:
   - First group of 3's: starts at index 1 and ends at index 13.
   - Noise pixel 0's starting at index 14 until index 16.
   - A 3 at index 17 followed by more noise pixels until index 20.
   - Finally, a 3 ending the sequence at index 31.

However, the test output shows that the first group of 3's does not continue uninterrupted after the initial noise pixels at index 14:

Test Output: `[0, 3, 3,..., 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0,...]`. It suggests that the first group of 3's (indices 1 to 13) merged improperly with the last 3 (at index 31).

So, based on our analysis, the test output doesn't seem to be consistent with the applied transformation algorithm since the groups of identical numbers weren't treated properly during the merging process. Thus, the modification did not produce the desired outcome. Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
    "value": 2
}
```
------
 Based on the given transformation steps and the description provided, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we note that Step 10 specifies that overlapping regions should be merged to form a single contiguous region. We see this happening in the test output where the sequence `[3, 3,..., 3, 0, 0, 3,...]` indicates a merger of two groups of threes separated by noise pixels (0).

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the merger does not fully adhere to the rules described earlier. Specifically, the merged section contains multiple objects interspersed with noise pixels instead of forming one long contiguous run of identical numbers followed immediately by a group of zeros.

Therefore, based on this discrepancy, I cannot rate the test output highly. My recommendation would be to revisit the implementation of Step 10 to ensure proper handling of object mergers according to the specified rules.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
    "value": 3
}
```
