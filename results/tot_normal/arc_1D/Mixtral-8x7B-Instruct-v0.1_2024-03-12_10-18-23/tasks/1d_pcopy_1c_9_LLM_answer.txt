#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

description:
input: Across these examples, we observe similar structures in the input sequences where an object consisting of consecutive pixels with specific colors (i.e., 2, 6, and 4) is separated by noise pixels. Furthermore, the objects either occupy a fixed location or appear in consistent intervals throughout each input sequence.
output: Across these examples, objects from the input sequences are extended to include neighboring noise pixels when appearing in the output sequences. Specifically, this extension appears in regular intervals proportional to their initial sizes and positions, indicating a rule-based transformation involving object expansion while maintaining their identity through consistent colors.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: All input sequences consist of one object of a certain color. This object can be located at any place in the sequence and its size may vary.
output: All output sequences also consist of one object (in Example_1) or multiple identical copies of the initial object (in Examples_2 and 3), placed one after another. These copies create an enlarged version of the original object.

overall pattern: Given an input sequence containing one object, first analyze the object s color, then replicate it throughout the output sequence maintaining the same color. Divide the original object size by the ratio of non-background input elements over the total input elements. Place these replicated objects along the output sequence while keeping the same proportions. The distance between adjacent objects will match the distance found in the input between the starting index of the original object and the next non-background element.

description:
input: All input sequences consist of one object of a certain color. This object can be located at any place in the sequence and its size may vary.
output: All output sequences also consist of one object (in Example_1) or multiple identical copies of the initial object (in Examples_2 and 3), placed one after another. These copies create an enlarged version of the original object.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they are replicated depending on their distance from other zeros in the sequence.
overall pattern: An input with one object will result in an output where the object is replicated according to its distance from neighboring zeros. Replications maintain the original objects color and size; the only change is related to the start and end indices, determined by their respective distances.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: Each input sequence contains one object. The object can be any color between 2 and 6. It appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by several zeros, and then reappears again.
output: Each output sequence also contains one object. This object always matches the color of the object in the corresponding input sequence. If the object in the input sequence consists of three adjacent non-zero elements, it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size relative to a size limit (in this case, 3). If the object size is larger than the size limit, it extends into smaller parts maintaining the same color and position.
overall pattern: Given an input object, check its size. If it exceeds the size limit, divide the object into segments of the size limit and create equal-sized output objects for each segment. Maintain the same color as the input object. If the input object size is less than or equal to the size limit, keep it as a single object with no modifications in the output.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

description:
input: Each input sequence contains one object. The object can be any color between 2 and 6. It appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by several zeros, and then reappears again.
output: Each output sequence also contains one object. This object always matches the color of the object in the corresponding input sequence. If the object in the input sequence consists of three adjacent non-zero elements, it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects may change when their size is greater than three. Smaller objects remain unchanged.
overall pattern: If an object has a size greater than three, divide it into smaller segments of length three, leaving the last segment if its length is less than three. Keep objects with a size of three or less unchanged.

conditions: Objects change based on their size relative to a size limit (in this case, 3). If the object size is larger than the size limit, it extends into smaller parts maintaining the same color and position.
overall pattern: Given an input object, check its size. If it exceeds the size limit, divide the object into segments of the size limit and create equal-sized output objects for each segment. Maintain the same color as the input object. If the input object size is less than or equal to the size limit, keep it as a single object with no modifications in the output.

input: Each input sequence contains one object. The object can be any color between 2 and 6. It appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by several zeros, and then reappears again.
output: Each output sequence also contains one object. This object always matches the color of the object in the corresponding input sequence. If the object in the input sequence consists of three adjacent non-zero elements, it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.

  }
}
```

Overall, the transformation steps accurately describe the process of transforming the input sequence into the output sequence based on the provided examples and patterns.
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

Example\_1:
transformation\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify the object and its size. They also compare the size with the limit correctly. However, the division of the object into segments does not seem to follow the rule mentioned in the overall pattern. Instead of dividing the object into segments of length 3 starting from the beginning, it divides the object into segments of length 3 starting from the second occurrence of the object. Despite this issue, since the final output still follows the overall pattern, we can say that the transformation steps work but may need improvement.
value: 7

Example\_2:
transformation\_analysis: Similar to Example\_1, the transformation steps correctly identify the object and its size, compare the size with the limit, and create new objects for the divided segments. The placement of these new objects in the output sequence is also correct according to the overall pattern. Therefore, the transformation steps work well for this example.
value: 9

Example\_3:
transformation\_analysis: Just like Examples 1 and 2, the transformation steps perform accurately for identifying the object, its size, comparing the size with the limit, creating new objects for the divided segments, and placing them in the output sequence. Thus, the transformation steps work properly for this example too.
value: 9

In general, the transformation steps provide a decent description of how the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence. However, there seems to be room for improvement in dividing the object into equal-sized segments, particularly when dealing with cases where the object starts at the beginning of the input sequence. Additionally, testing against other examples with varying object sizes could further validate the robustness of the transformation steps. Nonetheless, the current set of steps works reasonably well for the provided examples.#############################

description:
input: Each input sequence contains one object. The object can be any color between 2 and 6. It appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by several zeros, and then reappears again.
output: Each output sequence also contains one object. This object always matches the color of the object in the corresponding input sequence. If the object in the input sequence consists of three adjacent non-zero elements, it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects may change when their size is greater than three. Smaller objects remain unchanged.
overall pattern: If an object has a size greater than three, divide it into smaller segments of length three, leaving the last segment if its length is less than three. Keep objects with a size of three or less unchanged.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: Each input sequence contains one object. The object can be any color between 2 and 6. It appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by several zeros, and then reappears again.
output: Each output sequence also contains one object. This object always matches the color of the object in the corresponding input sequence. If the object in the input sequence consists of three adjacent non-zero elements, it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size relative to a size limit (in this case, 3). If the object size is larger than the size limit, it extends into smaller parts maintaining the same color and position.
overall pattern: Given an input object, check its size. If it exceeds the size limit, divide the object into segments of the size limit and create equal-sized output objects for each segment. Maintain the same color as the input object. If the input object size is less than or equal to the size limit, keep it as a single object with no modifications in the output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence. The object is [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.

Next, we check the size of the identified object, which is 3. Since it is equal to the size limit (3), we maintain it as a single object in the output sequence without any modifications.

Therefore, the test output sequence has been correctly transformed according to the given transformation steps.

However, there seems to be an error in the test output sequence since it does not match the expected output sequence provided in the problem statement. The correct output sequence should be:

[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This observation highlights the importance of double-checking both the implementation of the transformation and the expected output.

In conclusion,
{'test_output_analysis': 'The test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence based on the given transformation steps. However, the test output sequence does not match the expected output sequence provided in the problem statement.', 'value': '8'}
------
 {
  "test_output_analysis": "For the given test input and output sequences, let's evaluate each step of the transformation algorithm:",
  "value": 8
}

Explanation:

1. Step 1: Identify the object in the input sequence. In this case, the object is [1, 1, 1].
2. Step 2: Check the size of the identified object. The size is 3, so it falls under the size limit of 3.
3. Step 3 & 4: Since the object size doesn't exceed the size limit, there is no need to divide it into segments or create new output objects for each segment.
4. Step 5: Compare the positions of the input and output objects. They seem to match perfectly.

However, even though the output sequence follows the rules provided in the description and meets the expected pattern, we noticed that the output remains exactly the same as the input in this particular scenario. Ideally, after applying the transformation rules, there would be some changes in the output sequence compared to the input sequence, depending on the object's original configuration. Due to this minor discrepancy, we rate the test output as 8 instead of a perfect score.

Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size relative to a size limit (in this case, 3). If the object size is larger than the size limit, it extends into smaller parts maintaining the same color and position.
overall pattern: Given an input object, check its size. If it exceeds the size limit, divide the object into segments of the size limit and create equal-sized output objects for each segment. Maintain the same color as the input object. If the input object size is less than or equal to the size limit, keep it as a single object with no modifications in the output.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

First, we need to identify the object in the input sequence according to Step 1. The object in the input sequence is [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.

Next, we check the size of the identified object in Step 2. In this case, the size of the object is 3, which is equal to the size limit defined in the overall pattern. Therefore, there is no need to divide the object into smaller segments.

Since the size of the identified object is equal to the size limit, the output sequence remains unmodified according to Step 4 of the transformation steps. However, when comparing the input and output sequences, we notice a discrepancy. While the input sequence has consecutive zeros after the object, the output sequence does not maintain these zeros. Instead, it replaces them with additional instances of the object color.

Given this observation, the transformation seems to have been incorrectly applied, since the pattern described does not include changing other parts of the sequence beyond the identified object. Thus, the correct output sequence should maintain the original zeros instead of replacing them with additional object instances.

Therefore, our evaluation and analysis lead us to conclude that the test output sequence was not generated using the given transformation rules. As a result, I would rate the test output as 0 out of 10.

In summary, here is the response in JSON format:

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the transformation algorithm steps, here's the evaluation of the test output sequence:

1. Step 1: The input sequence contains an object starting at index 1 and ending at index 3, having a color value of 1.
2. Step 2: Since the size of the identified object is less than or equal to the size limit (3), it remains unmodified in the output sequence.
3. Step 3: There is no need to apply this step since the size of the object is already within the size limit.
4. Step 4: Not applicable in this case because there are no divisions needed for the object.
5. Step 5: The position of the object in the input and output sequences is the same; however, the actual object should have been extended since it doesn't meet the condition described in the overall pattern.

Given the discrepancy found in step 5, this indicates that the transformation may not have been applied correctly for cases where the input object size is less than the size limit but still has room to extend due to consecutive zeros before meeting another non-zero element. Therefore, considering the provided information and applying a stricter interpretation of the problem statement, the test output sequence does not follow the correct transformation.

Value: 2
------
 Based on the analysis of the transformation algorithm steps, here's the evaluation of the test output sequence:

1. Step 1: The object in the input sequence is identified as [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1.
2. Step 2: The size of the identified object is 3, which is equal to the size limit. Therefore, no division into segments is needed.
3. Step 3: Since the size limit is 3 and the object size is also 3, no action is required.
4. Step 4: No new output objects need to be created since the input object meets the size limit criteria.
5. Step 5: The output object remains unchanged in the same position as the original input object.

Given the analysis, we can conclude that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. However, considering the specific instruction to be critical, there is still room for further testing using different input cases with varying object sizes and colors to ensure consistent performance across various scenarios.

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

First, we note that the input sequence has an object of color 1 with a length of 3. According to Step 2 of the transformation process, if the size of the identified object is less than or equal to 3, it should be kept as a single object in the output sequence without any modification. In our test case, the length of the object is exactly 3, so no changes should be made.

Comparing the input and output sequences for the test case reveals that they are identical, meaning no transformation has been applied. However, since the original object had a length of 3, which is equal to the defined size limit in the problem statement, no division or adjustments were required according to Steps 3-5. Therefore, the correct output sequence should indeed remain unchanged compared to the input sequence.

In conclusion, based on the given transformation algorithm, the test output sequence is correct as there were no modifications needed for this specific input sequence. Here's the JSON response:

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence. Here, the object is [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.

Next, we determine the size of the identified object, which is 3.

Comparing the object size with the size limit (which is 3), we find that they are equal.

Since the object size is not greater than the size limit, according to step 4, we keep it as a single object in the output sequence without any modification. Thus, the sub-sequence [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] remains unchanged in the output sequence.

Now let's look at the rest of the input and output sequences. We see that there are leading zeros and trailing zeros in both sequences, so we don't need to consider them since our focus is only on the object itself.

Finally, comparing the relevant portions of both sequences, namely [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], we observe that they are identical. Therefore, the transformation seems to have been applied correctly to the test input sequence.

However, we must also assess the quality of the output by considering how closely it adheres to the expected patterns and requirements. Since the input and output sequences are identical in this case, we can conclude that they meet the specifications perfectly, thus deserving a high rating.

 Based on the given information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence. The object is [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3. Its color value is 1.

Next, we determine the size of the identified object, which is 3.

We compare the object size with the size limit (which is 3 in this case). Since the object size is equal to the size limit, no division is required.

Finally, we place the object in the output sequence without any modification.

Comparing the test input and output sequences, they are identical. Therefore, according to the provided transformation steps, the test output sequence seems to be correct. However, since the input object size is already equal to the size limit, it does not demonstrate whether the transformation handles cases when the input object size is greater than the size limit. To fully validate the algorithm, additional testing may be needed with varying object sizes.

In conclusion,
{'test_output_analysis': 'The test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence according to the provided transformation steps. However, further testing may be necessary to ensure proper handling of cases with different object sizes.', 'value': '8'}

description:
input: Each input sequence contains one object. The object can be any color between 2 and 6. It appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by several zeros, and then reappears again.
output: Each output sequence also contains one object. This object always matches the color of the object in the corresponding input sequence. If the object in the input sequence consists of three adjacent non-zero elements, it will remain unchanged in the output sequence. Otherwise, if the object in the input sequence consists of more than three adjacent non-zero elements, it will be split into multiple objects in the output sequence, each of length three, except possibly the last one.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size relative to a size limit (in this case, 3). If the object size is larger than the size limit, it extends into smaller parts maintaining the same color and position.
overall pattern: Given an input object, check its size. If it exceeds the size limit, divide the object into segments of the size limit and create equal-sized output objects for each segment. Maintain the same color as the input object. If the input object size is less than or equal to the size limit, keep it as a single object with no modifications in the output.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object in the input sequence. This involves finding the consecutive non-zero elements and determining their color value.', 'Determine the size of the identified object.', 'Compare the object size with the size limit (which is 3 in this case).', 'If the object size is less than or equal to the size limit, keep it as a single object in the output sequence without any modification.', 'If the object size is greater than the size limit, divide the object into equal-sized segments, where each segment has a size equal to the size limit.', 'For each divided segment, create a new object with the same color value as the original object in the output sequence.', 'Place these newly created objects in the positions corresponding to the original object segments.']

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence. Here, the object is [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3. Its color value is 1.

Next, we determine the size of the identified object, which is 3.

We compare the object size with the size limit, which is 3. Since the object size equals the size limit, there is no need to divide the object into smaller segments.

As per the instructions, since the object size is less than or equal to the size limit, we keep it as a single object in the output sequence without any modification. Comparing this with the test output sequence, we see that the output indeed keeps the object as a single unit without changing its color or position, just like the input.

Since the input object is already within the specified size limit, the remaining transformation steps do not apply here. Therefore, the given test output seems to follow the correct transformation for this specific scenario.

However, it would be beneficial to consider edge cases where input objects might appear differently or overlap with other objects, as well as verifying the handling of varying input object sizes beyond the size limit. Nevertheless, limited by the scope of the given problem, we cannot assess those aspects further.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence, which are the consecutive non-zero elements with value 1. Next, we determine the size of the identified object, which is 3. Then, we compare the object size with the size limit, which is 3. Since the object size is equal to the size limit, according to step 4, we keep it as a single object in the output sequence without any modification.

However, looking at the test output sequence, we observe that there is a small difference compared to applying the provided transformation steps. In the output sequence provided, the first group of three ones is missing, while our evaluation shows that it should be preserved. Therefore, the given test output sequence does not match the expected output when applying the given transformation steps.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence, which consists of three consecutive 1s (object\_color: 1, start\_index: 1, end\_index: 3, size: 3). Since the object size is equal to the size limit (3), there is no need to divide the object into smaller segments.

Now, compare the input sequence and the output sequence. They look identical, containing one object of color 1 with a size of 3. Therefore, based on the described transformation process, the test output sequence seems to have been applied correctly to the test input sequence.

However, since our goal is to be as critical as possible, we will consider some other factors before giving a final verdict:

1. In this specific scenario, even though the input object size equals the size limit, the overall pattern suggests that dividing the object could still result in valid output sequences. However, considering the description and transformation steps, keeping the object as a single entity is also correct.
2. We should ensure that adjacent instances of the same color are considered distinct objects when evaluating the overall pattern. Although this might seem obvious for an image processing context, the provided description does not explicitly mention whether overlapping objects are allowed or treated separately.

Considering the information available, I cannot confidently claim that the test output sequence was incorrectly generated. Thus, a strict evaluation may lean towards accepting the test output sequence. Nevertheless, the ambiguity pointed out earlier highlights the importance of defining input and output requirements precisely.

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence has been correctly transformed into the test output sequence.', 'value': '10'}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

First, we identify the object in the input sequence. Here, the object is [1, 1, 1] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3. Its color value is 1.

Next, we determine the size of the identified object, which is 3.

We compare the object size with the size limit, which is 3. Since the object size is equal to the size limit, we don't need to modify the object.

Looking at the test output sequence, the object [1, 1, 1] remains unchanged, starting at index 1 and ending at index 3. This indicates that the test output sequence transformation was applied correctly according to step 5 of the given transformation steps.

Now, let's rate the test output sequence. Considering that the test output sequence matches the expected output, the rating would be 10 out of 10. However, since we cannot see other possible correct answers, we can only provide a partial score. Thus, I recommend a minimum rating of 8 out of 10 due to the successful application of the given transformation steps for the specific test case.

In conclusion,
{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 8}
