The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

These objects can appear anywhere along the length of the sequence.\noutput: Similarly, across all output sequences, each consists of a solitary unvarying object having consistent internal characteristics - strings of continuous pixels displaying uniform hues.

We observe that the first non-zero element is located at index 1, which corresponds to the color 1. This confirms the initial step described in the transformation steps.\n\nNext, we proceed with the `remove_object_from_start` operation. If we carefully examine the test input and output sequences, we notice inconsistencies in applying this step. In the test output, some of the leading zeros have been removed without apparent reason. Accordingly, removing the object's (color 1) elements from their current positions should yield the following intermediate state:\n\nintermediate = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFinally, we must complete the `append_object_to_end` operation. By inspecting the desired output and comparing it to our intermediate sequence, we identify discrepancies here too. Notably, there seems to be an extra color 1 appended at the end of the sequence, even though the object's size remains unchanged according to the problem description. Consequently, appending the object's elements back at the end results in:\n\nfinal\\_output = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nIn conclusion, although the overall idea of moving the object to the end while preserving its internal properties appears correct, the actual implementation exhibits flaws. Specifically, unnecessary removal of zeros during the `remove_object_from_start` step and incorrect appending of the object during the `append_object_to_end` step render the output invalid.\n\nTherefore, our evaluation generates the following JSON response:\n\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\\n\\nStep 1: Confirm that the first non-zero element is identified correctly. This check passes.\\nStep 2: Examine the removal of the object's elements. Notice that unnecessary zeros were also removed, causing misalignment in the sequence. This violates the intended behavior.\\nStep 3: Check whether the appended object aligns with the expected output.
