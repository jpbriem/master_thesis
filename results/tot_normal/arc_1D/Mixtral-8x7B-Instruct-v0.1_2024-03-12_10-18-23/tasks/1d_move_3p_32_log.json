(Pass)\n- Although affected by Step 2, this step was still executed correctly.\n\nOverall, despite accurately identifying the correct starting point and applying some transformation steps, the main problem lies in Step 2, where objects after position 0 were not left untouched as required. Due to this issue, the first two zeros became separated from the rest of the original object and were misplaced at the start of the resulting sequence. Therefore, I rate the result 7 out of 10 since most of the operations were carried out according to specifications, except the primary error mentioned above."
