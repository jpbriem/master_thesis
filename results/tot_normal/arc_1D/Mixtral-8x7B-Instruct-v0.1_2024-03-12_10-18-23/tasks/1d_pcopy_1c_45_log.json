The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Identify contiguous groups of non-zero elements: In the input sequence, there are three such groups: [5, 5, 5] at indices 2-4, [5] at index 11, and [5, 5, 5] at indices 18-20.

Calculate the length of gaps between these groups: In the input sequence, the gap lengths are 6 and 7. In the output sequence, they are 3 and 7.\n\n3. Shift each group to the right by a number of places equal to the sum of gap lengths preceding it: This is where the main discrepancy lies. In the input sequence, the first group starts at index 2, so after shifting it would start at index 8 (2+6). However, in the output sequence, the first group starts at index 2, indicating no shift. Similarly, the second group should be shifted from index 11 to index 19 (11+8), but in the output sequence, it appears at index 16, indicating a smaller shift than expected.\n\n4. Maintain the order and size of each group throughout this process: Both the input and output sequences maintain the order and size of the groups.\n\n5. Preserve the original shape of each object while altering their positions: The shapes of the objects are preserved, but the positions are not altered consistently according to the rules.\n\n6. Note that new objects will not appear, and existing objects will never merge or split apart: True for both the input and output sequences.\n\n7. Base shifts on gap lengths, ensuring larger gaps result in greater shifts: Not followed correctly in the output sequence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the test output does not fully adhere to the specified transformation steps. Therefore, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we identify contiguous groups of non-zero elements (objects):\nInput: [[0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [5], [0, 0, 0], [5], [0, 0, 0], [5]]\nOutput: [[0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0], []]\n\nNext, calculate the length of gaps between these groups. In the output, there is one gap of length 4 before the second object, two gaps of length 3 before the fourth and sixth objects, and one gap of length 2 before the seventh object. Summing up these lengths gives us 4 + 6 + 2 = 12.\n\nWe then shift each group to the right by a number of places equal to the sum of gap lengths preceding it:\nInput after shifting: [[0, 0], [], [], [5], [0, 0, 0], [5], [0, 0, 0], [5]]\n\nNow maintain the order and size of each group throughout the process, and preserve the original shape of each object while altering their positions. Comparing our results so far to the expected output shows that something went wrong during the shifting step. Let's reevaluate our calculations.\n\nGap lengths: 4, 6, 2, totaling 12. We need to distribute this sum among the five gaps as follows:\n- Gap 1 (before the first object): 4 - 2 = 2\n- Gap 2 (between the first and second objects): 6 - 4 = 2\n- Gap 3 (between the second and third objects): 2 - 0 = 2\n\nWith corrected shifting, we obtain:\nInput after correct shifting: [[0, 0, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [5], [0, 0, 5], [0, 0], []]\n\nComparing this final result with the expected output, we see that they match perfectly.

In the test output sequence, those groups are still present without merging or splitting.\n2. Calculate the length of gaps between these groups.\nThe lengths of the gaps in the test input sequence are 2, 6, and 8 indices long. However, since the gaps are measured between the groups of non-zero elements, we need to take into account the leading zeros before the first group and the trailing zeros after the last group.

Shift each group to the right by a number of places equal to the sum of gap lengths preceding it.\n- Group 1: Start at index 2 (shifted by gap len. 0)\n- Group 2: Start at index 8 (shifted by gap len. 2)\n- Group 3: Start at index 19 (shifted by gap len. 8 + 2 = 10)\n\nThese starting indices match the locations where the groups of non-zero elements begin in the test output sequence.\n\n4.

Base shifts on gap lengths, ensuring larger gaps result in greater shifts:\n   - As mentioned earlier, we couldn't calculate gap lengths accurately, so we can't verify if this guideline was followed.\n\nGiven the confusion and discrepancies found when evaluating the given test output sequence based on the provided rules and steps, I highly recommend revisiting the transformation procedure to ensure consistency with the problem statement and description.

In the output sequence, the gaps have lengths 3, 0, and 8.\n3. Shift each group to the right by a number of places equal to the sum of gap lengths preceding it: In the input sequence, no shifts occur since there are no gaps before the first group.

Maintain the order and size of each group throughout this process: Both the input and output sequences maintain the correct order and size of the groups.\n5. Preserve the original shape of each object while altering their positions: While the shapes are preserved within the input and output sequences individually, the shift in the output sequence does not correspond to what would be expected based on the input sequence. Specifically, the second group should not have been shifted.\n6. Note that new objects will not appear, and existing objects will never merge or split apart: This condition holds true for both the input and output sequences.\n7. Base shifts on gap lengths, ensuring larger gaps result in greater shifts: Although this condition generally applies to the output sequence, the issue identified earlier violates this rule because the second group moves despite having a zero-length gap beforehand.\n\nGiven the discrepancy found in the evaluation, I cannot confidently say that the test output sequence accurately reflects the application of the provided transformation algorithm to the test input sequence. Consequently, my assessment of the test output quality is compromised. Nevertheless, considering the transformation steps and the described pattern, I am obligated to provide a numeric rating. Since the test output contains errors compared to the desired outcome under the given rules, a generous yet cautious rating based on partial adherence might be a 3 out of 10.

Identify contiguous groups of non-zero elements, which represent objects. In the input sequence, there are three objects with color 5: [5, 5, 5], [5], and [5].\n\n2. Calculate the length of gaps between these groups. There is a gap of length 0 before the first object, a gap of length 0 between the first and second object, and a gap of length 7 between the second and third object.\n\n3. Shift each group to the right by a number of places equal to the sum of gap lengths preceding it. This means:\n   - The first object remains unshifted because the sum of gap lengths preceding it is 0.\n   - The second object should be shifted to the right by 0 (sum of preceding gaps) + 0 (length of previous gap) = 0 places. However, in the test output sequence, it appears after 5 zeros instead of immediately after the first object.\n   - The third object should be shifted to the right by 0 (sum of preceding gaps) + 0 (length of previous gap) + 7 (length of current gap) = 7 places. In the test output sequence, it appears after 8 zeros instead of 7, indicating that the shift was incorrectly applied.\n\n4. Maintain the order and size of each group throughout this process. In the test output sequence, the order and size of the objects were preserved, but they were not shifted correctly according to the specified rule.\n\n5. Preserve the original shape of each object while altering their positions. Although the shapes of the objects are maintained, the positions were not altered correctly based on the stated rules.\n\n6. Note that new objects will not appear, and existing objects will never merge or split apart. No new objects appeared, and no merging or splitting occurred in the test output sequence.\n\n7. Base shifts on gap lengths, ensuring larger gaps result in greater shifts. As mentioned earlier, the shift amounts did not follow the correct rule based on gap lengths.\n\nGiven these observations, we cannot conclude that the test output sequence was obtained through the specified transformation algorithm due to discrepancies in shifting the objects.

Calculate the length of each gap between identified groups.\n   Gap Lengths: [0, 3, 3]\n\n3. Sum the lengths of the gaps before each group.\n   Cumulative Sum Of Gap Lengths = [0, 0+3, 0+3+3]\n   Result: [0, 3, 6]\n\n4. Shift each group to the right according to the cumulative sum of gap lengths calculated for that group.\n   Shifted Groups = [[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0], [5]]\n\n5. Reconstruct the output sequence using the shifted groups.\n   Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nComparing the obtained output with the expected one, there seems to be an issue at the second shift point where the third group of `5` starts. After adjusting the output accordingly, the correct result would be:\n\nCorrected Output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBased on the found discrepancy, we cannot completely approve the proposed output without further clarification and correction. However, assuming that the other steps were carried out correctly, I would rate the transformation a 7 out of 10 due to the single error. This evaluation assumes the remaining steps follow those outlined above consistently.\n\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}\n------\n To evaluate the correctness of the transformation applied to the test input sequence, let's go through each transformation step and analyze the resulting test output sequence.\n\n1. Identify groups of contiguous non-zero elements in the input sequence.\n\t* Test input contains three groups of contiguous non-zero elements: `[5, 5, 5]`, `[5]`, and `[5]`. This is consistent with the overall pattern.\n2. Calculate the length of each gap between identified groups.\n\t* There are two gaps: one of length 2 (between the first and second group) and another of length 6 (between the second and third group).\n3. Sum the lengths of the gaps before each group.\n\t* Gap lengths before each group are 0 (before the first group), 2 (before the second group), and 8 (before the third group).\n4. Shift each group to the right according to the cumulative sum of gap lengths calculated for that group.\n\t* First group stays at its place (shift = 0).\n\t* Second group moves 2 places to the right (becomes `[0, 0, 5]`).\n\t* Third group moves 8 places to the right (becomes `[0, 5, 0, 0, 0]`).\n\t* However, the test output shows a shift of 7 rather than 8 for the third group (it becomes `[0, 0, 0, 5, 0]` instead). This indicates an error in applying the transformation.\n5. Reconstruct the output sequence using the shifted groups.\n\t* We cannot proceed further because we found errors during the previous step.\n\nValue: Based on the observed discrepancy in the shifting of the third group, I would rate the test output as **5 out of 10**. It seems that there might be off-by-one errors or issues related to zero-based indexing when implementing the transformation steps.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all input sequences, objects consist of consecutive sequence elements with the same nonzero color value. Each object has a distinct color value, a start index (the index of its first element), an end index (the index of its last element + 1), and a size (the number of elements it occupies).\noutput: Across all output sequences, objects also consist of consecutive sequence elements with the same nonzero color value. Compared to their respective inputs, some objects have been shifted to the right by a constant amount of indices, preserving their original shape but changing their positions. Some objects remain unchanged. New objects do not appear, and existing objects never merge or split apart.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change depending on the presence of empty spaces (gaps) between them; larger gaps result in greater shifts.\noverall pattern: For any input, find contiguous groups of non-zero elements. Calculate the lengths of gaps between these groups. Shift each group a number of places to the right equal to the sum of gap lengths preceding it. Maintain the order and size of each group throughout this process.\n\n\ntransformation steps: [{'step': 'Identify groups of contiguous non-zero elements in the input sequence.', 'operation': 'Group', 'parameters': ['non-zero elements']}, {'step': 'Calculate the length of each gap between identified groups.', 'operation': 'GapLength', 'parameters': ['groups']}, {'step': 'Sum the lengths of the gaps before each group.', 'operation': 'CumulativeSumOfGapLengths', 'parameters': ['gap lengths']}, {'step': 'Shift each group to the right according to the cumulative sum of gap lengths calculated for that group.', 'operation': 'ShiftRight', 'parameters': ['groups, cumulative sum of gap lengths']}, {'step': 'Reconstruct the output sequence using the shifted groups.', 'operation': 'ConstructOutputSequence', 'parameters': ['shifted groups']}]\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Based on the provided information, we will evaluate the given test output sequence by considering each step of the transformation algorithm and analyzing whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\n1. Identifying groups of contiguous non-zero elements in the input sequence:\nInput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nGroups: [[5, 5, 5], [5], [5]]\n\n2. Calculating the length of each gap between identified groups:\nGap lengths: [3, 3]\n\n3. Summing the lengths of the gaps before each group:\nCumulative sum of gap lengths: [3, 6]\n\n4. Shifting each group to the right according to the cumulative sum of gap lengths calculated for that group:\nShifted groups: [[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5]]\n\n5. Reconstructing the output sequence using the shifted groups:\nOutput sequence: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nComparing the obtained output sequence with the given test output sequence, there is a discrepancy in the placement of the second and third groups. Since the steps were followed correctly, the issue appears to lie in the incorrect shifting of one or both of those groups. As a result, although the final output sequence does contain valid objects positioned relative to each other, the specific arrangement does not match the desired output.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would rate the test output as a 5 out of 10 because while the general idea and structure are present, the specific implementation contains errors leading to mismatched positions of certain groups.\n------\n To evaluate the test output sequence, let's go through each transformation step and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into the provided test output sequence.\n\n1. Identify groups of contiguous non-zero elements in the input sequence.\n   - Input: [[0, 0, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0],...]\n\n2. Calculate the length of each gap between identified groups.\n   - Gaps: [2, 3, 3, 3, 16,...]\n\n3. Sum the lengths of the gaps before each group.\n   - Cumulative sums: [2, 5, 8, 11, 27,...]\n\n4. Shift each group to the right according to the cumulative sum of gap lengths calculated for that group.\n   - Expected output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nComparing the expected output from step 4 with the provided test output, we can see they don't match. It seems that there is an error in the implementation of the transformation steps. In the provided test output, the second occurrence of 5 starts at position 7 instead of 10. Therefore, I cannot approve the test output based on the given transformation steps. After correcting the issue, please provide an updated test output for evaluation.\n\nValue: Based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as 3 out of 10 since the main idea of shifting groups is implemented incorrectly, resulting in misaligned groups in the output."
