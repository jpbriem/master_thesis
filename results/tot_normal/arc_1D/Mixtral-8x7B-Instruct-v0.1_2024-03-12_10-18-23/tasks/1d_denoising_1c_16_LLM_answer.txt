#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}.

output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    "value": 10
  }
}
```
------
 Here is the analysis for each example:

Example\_1:
input\_analysis: The given input description does not provide any specific information about what types of patterns should be present in the input data. However, it is clear that this example consists of a single object with a constant value (7) occupying most of the input sequence. Additionally, there are groups of zeros separating this main object from smaller objects at the beginning, middle, and end of the input sequence. Therefore, while the given input description doesn't explicitly state these properties, it can still apply to this example.

output\_analysis: Similarly, the given output description does not include explicit criteria for the output data. In this example, we see that the output is identical to the input except for the removal of certain consecutive sevens adjacent to the groups of zeros. This corresponds to removing the small objects in the input. Thus, although not detailed, the output description correctly captures the essential change occurring in this example.

value: 7

Example\_2:
input\_analysis: Similar to Example\_1, no particular features are specified in the input description. Nevertheless, this input contains two large objects consisting of eight surrounded by zeros and separated by another group of eight. There are also small objects at both ends composed of individual eights. Hence, even though the input description lacks precision, it does describe the general structure found here.

output\_analysis: Again, the output description fails to mention specific characteristics related to the expected output. Here, the entire second large object has been replaced with zeros, along with one instance of eight at each end of the original sequence. Although vague, the output description accurately reflects the changes made in this example.

value: 7

Example\_3:
input\_analysis: As with previous examples, the input description provides no concrete qualifications. However, this input consists of three separate large objects comprising eight interspersed with single instances of eight scattered throughout the sequence. Despite the absence of explicit requirements, the input description somewhat applies to this example but leaves room for more precise guidelines.

output\_analysis: Once again, the output description offers limited guidance concerning the desired output format. Here, the last two large objects have been converted to zeros, as well as the single instances of eight dispersed throughout the input. Overall, despite its vagueness, the output description matches the modifications performed in this example.

value: 7

In summary, the provided input and output descriptions do not enumerate specific qualities one would expect when encountering these examples. Nonetheless, their general nature allows them to apply to some extent to each case presented. To improve upon these descriptions, it would be helpful to incorporate aspects such as the presence of distinct objects containing consistent nonzero values, potential variations in object sizes and positions, and rules governing how various objects transform in relation to one another during conversion from input to output.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, we observe objects being identified by their unique nonzero color values. These objects may span across one or more indices, forming a continuous sequence of identical numbers. In some cases, multiple objects can appear in an input sequence.
output: Across all output sequences, we observe that any contiguous groupings of identical numbers (objects) in the input sequence are reduced to a single instance of that number, while maintaining its original value. All other instances are converted to noise pixels (represented by 0). This operation results in having at most one instance of each unique number in the output sequence. We also notice that the order of objects is preserved from input to output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

description: None

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects may change depending on whether they are adjacent or separated by noise pixels. If multiple objects have the same color, they tend to merge into a single object in the output.
overall pattern: If multiple adjacent objects with the same color exist in the input, they combine into one object in the output that spans across them. Otherwise, the object retains its original shape and position in the output. There doesn't seem to be any effect related to non-adjacent objects, so the merging process appears to depend only on adjacency.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they are adjacent and consist of the same color. If multiple adjacent objects of the same color exist, they will merge into one larger object.
overall pattern: Adjacent objects of the same color get merged into one object while preserving their leftmost index. This results in a single object covering all original smaller objects of the same color.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, each sequence contains one or more objects with no particular order or arrangement. Each object can be composed of one or more adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always one object (with possibly varying sizes) having the maximum value among all nonzero values present in the sequence. All other nonzero values either disappear or become noise pixels depending upon their relative positions with respect to the maximum valued object.


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they have lower values than the highest nonzero value present in the sequence.
overall pattern: For each input sequence, first find the highest nonzero value (max_value). Then, turn all objects with lower values into noise pixels or remove them altogether. Keep only the object(s) with max_value.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

description:
input: Across all input sequences, each sequence contains one or more objects with no particular order or arrangement. Each object can be composed of one or more adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always one object (with possibly varying sizes) having the maximum value among all nonzero values present in the sequence. All other nonzero values either disappear or become noise pixels depending upon their relative positions with respect to the maximum valued object.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they have lower values than the highest nonzero value present in the sequence.
overall pattern: For each input sequence, first find the highest nonzero value (max_value). Then, turn all objects with lower values into noise pixels or remove them altogether. Keep only the object(s) with max_value.

Additionally, since sorting objects by starting position does not affect the output in this case, it cannot be evaluated either.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description:
input: Across all input sequences, each sequence contains one or more objects with no particular order or arrangement. Each object can be composed of one or more adjacent pixels with the same nonzero value.
output: Across all output sequences, there is always one object (with possibly varying sizes) having the maximum value among all nonzero values present in the sequence. All other nonzero values either disappear or become noise pixels depending upon their relative positions with respect to the maximum valued object.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they have lower values than the highest nonzero value present in the sequence.
overall pattern: For each input sequence, first find the highest nonzero value (max_value). Then, turn all objects with lower values into noise pixels or remove them altogether. Keep only the object(s) with max_value.



transformation steps: ['Find the maximum nonzero value (max_value) in the input sequence.', 'For each object in the input sequence, check if its value is less than max_value.', "If an object's value is less than max_value, turn all pixels of this object into noise pixels (i.e., set their value to 0).", 'Keep only the objects with a value equal to max_value in the output sequence.']

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

description: None
overall pattern:
conditions: Object(s) may change their relative positions and merge together under some conditions linked with their position, color, and presence of noise pixels.
overall pattern: Combine adjacent objects with the same color, preserving their color, when they are completely surrounded by noise pixels or positioned closely; otherwise, keep objects separate and maintain the relative order of differently colored objects.


transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence based on non-zero pixel values.', 'Step 2: Check if any two adjacent objects have the same color and are either surrounded by noise pixels or closely located.', 'Step 3: If yes, combine those objects by merging their start and end indices while keeping the color value intact.', 'Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no further combinations are possible.', "Step 5: Fill in the gaps created due to object mergers with noise pixels (0's).", 'Step 6: Preserve the relative order of objects with different colors throughout the process.']


Test case:

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, we will evaluate the given test input sequence and the expected transformation result. We will follow the given transformation steps and analyze whether the test input sequence is correctly transformed into the test output sequence. Since there is no proposed test output sequence, we cannot provide a numeric rating. However, we can still perform the evaluation.

Test Input Sequence:
input = [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Transformation Steps Applied to Test Input:

Step 1: Identify objects
Objects in the input sequence based on non-zero pixel values:
[
{
"color": 7,
"start_index": 2,
"end_index": 8,
"size": 7
},
{
"color": 7,
"start_index": 13,
"end_index": 13,
"size": 1
},
{
"color": 7,
"start_index": 18,
"end_index": 18,
"size": 1
}
]

Step 2: Find adjacent objects with the same color and proper location
Adjacent objects found: [{color: 7, start_index: 13, end_index: 13}, {color: 7, start_index: 18, end_index: 18}]

Step 3: Merge objects
Merge objects by updating start and end indices:
[
{
"color": 7,
"start_index": 2,
"end_index": 8,
"size": 7
},
{
"color": 7,
"start_index": 13,
"end_index": 18,
"size": 6
}
]

Step 4: Repeat Steps 2-3
Since no more adjacent and similarly colored objects exist, this step terminates without additional changes.

Step 5: Fill in the gaps with noise pixels (0's)
Filled gaps: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0] + [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] => [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Transformed Output Sequence:
transformed_output = [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

As mentioned before, since there isn't any proposed test output sequence, it is impossible to compare our results and rate them accordingly. Nonetheless, we followed the given instructions and performed the required steps, showing the correct application of the provided algorithm to the test input sequence.
------
 Based on the provided information, I will attempt to evaluate the test output sequence and analyze whether the given transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. We will go through each step of the transformation algorithm and check if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its output sequence.

Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Transformation Steps:

1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on non-zero pixel values:
   Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 2, end_index: 7, size: 6}
   Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 13, size: 6}
   Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 18, end_index: 18, size: 1}

2. Check if any two adjacent objects have the same color and are either surrounded by noise pixels or closely located:
   In this case, Object_1 and Object_2 are adjacent, have the same color (7), and are separated by noise pixels (0's). Therefore, we do not combine them at this stage.

3. Combine those objects by merging their start and end indices while keeping the color value intact:
   As mentioned in step 2, we did not find any objects to combine at this stage.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no further combinations are possible:
   Since there were no objects combined in the previous steps, we don't need to repeat these steps.

5. Fill in the gaps created due to object mergers with noise pixels (0's):
   There are no gaps resulting from object mergers in our current scenario.

6. Preserve the relative order of objects with different colors throughout the process:
   This is more relevant when dealing with multiple colors, but still, it holds true here since no changes occurred to object ordering.

Since the provided output sequence is 'None', I cannot compare the final result directly. However, considering the described transformation, I would expect the output sequence to look like the original input sequence because there are no noise pixels inside the groups of 7s. Additionally, there is only one single 7, so it does not get merged with other 7s.

Therefore, my evaluation of the test output sequence would be as follows:
{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence appears to be unchanged after applying the given steps. While the input and expected output seem identical, the lack of specified output makes it difficult to confirm the correctness of the transformation fully.', 'value': '7'}

Please note that I converted the rating to a string as requested; however, technically, providing the actual output instead of a numerical rating might better suit the purpose in such cases.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the transformation algorithm, there is an issue in Step 5 where gaps created due to object mergers are not filled properly with noise pixels (0's) in the test output sequence. In particular, the first gap after the merged object at index 14 in the input sequence has not been filled with noise pixels. As a result, the correct output should include a noise pixel at index 15 instead of having another object with a color value.

In addition, it seems like Step 6 might not have been explicitly followed since the relative order of objects with different colors is not preserved in the test output sequence. Specifically, the second occurrence of color 7 appears before the color 0 that separates it from the first occurrence of color 7 in the input sequence. However, this issue could be caused by the improper implementation of Step 5 since filling the gaps with noise pixels would ensure the preservation of the relative order of objects with different colors throughout the process.

Thus, considering the issues identified in both Steps 5 and 6, the given test output sequence cannot be considered as being obtained through a proper application of the provided transformation algorithm.

Test Output Analysis: Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was transformed into the test output sequence correctly.
Value: 2
------
 Based on the analysis of the given transformation algorithm and the test input and output sequence provided, here is the evaluation:

Firstly, let's look at how the test input sequence would appear after applying Step 1 of the transformation algorithm:

Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Objects: [[7, 1, 3], [7, 4, 10], [7, 15, 15], [7, 19, 19]]

After checking for adjacent objects with the same color and merging them according to Steps 2, 3, and repeating it till no more combinations are possible (Step 4), we get:

Merged Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Merged Objects: [[7, 1, 10], [7, 15, 15], [7, 19, 19]]

Next, filling in the gaps created due to object mergers with noise pixels (0's) - Step 5, we have:

Filled Merged Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The final result matches the test output sequence exactly. Since there are no discrepancies found and the test output meets the expectations, it indicates that the given test output sequence follows the correct transformation of the test input sequence.

Therefore, the evaluation results are:
{
  'test_output_analysis': 'Each step of the transformation algorithm has been carefully examined and compared against the test input sequence and test output sequence. No inconsistencies were found, leading us to believe that the test input sequence was indeed correctly transformed into the test output sequence.',

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of each step of the transformation algorithm, here is the evaluation of the test output sequence:

1. In Step 1, the input sequence has identified objects correctly.
2. In Step 2, there are two sets of adjacent objects with the same color (7): the first one starts at index 3 and ends at index 12, and the second one starts at index 19 and ends at index 19. They are separated by noise pixels (0), so this condition is not applicable to them.
3. Since there were no eligible candidates in Step 2, there are no changes made in Step 3.
4. After repeating Steps 2 and 3, there are still no combined objects.
5. During Step 5, the gaps remain unfilled since there were no merged objects to create gaps.
6. In Step 6, it seems like the relative order of objects with different colors has been maintained, but there is an issue with object 7 at the very end. It appears after the noise pixels instead of before them. This breaks the rule mentioned in Step 6.

Therefore, I cannot provide a high rating as there was a violation found in Step 6. As a result, the value will be set to 5 out of 10. Note that this lower rating indicates some inconsistency compared to the provided examples, but does not necessarily mean that the implementation is entirely incorrect or flawed.

{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\nStep 1: Correctly identified objects in the input sequence.\nStep 2: No eligible adjacents objects found.\nStep 3: Not applicable due to no eligible objects.\nStep 4: Repeated steps 2 and 3 without finding eligible objects.\nStep 5: Skipped due to no merges.\nStep 6: Relative order was generally preserved, except for the last occurrence of object 7 appearing after the noise pixels instead of before them.', 'value': '5'}
------
 Based on the analysis of the transformation algorithm steps, here is the evaluation of the test output sequence:

1. In Step 1, objects were identified based on non-zero pixel values. The test input sequence has the correct objects marked.
2. In Step 2, we check if there are any two adjacent objects with the same color and surrounded by noise pixels or closely located. In this case, there are multiple instances where this condition holds true (e.g., 7-7 pair at index 1 and 2, and another one at index 14 and 15).
3. However, according to Step 3, these objects should be combined by merging their start and end indices while keeping the color value intact. This does not seem to happen in the provided test output since the first 7-7 pair was not merged even though it satisfies the required conditions.
4. Steps 4 to 6 involve repeating previous steps until no further combinations are possible, filling in gaps created due to object mergers, and preserving the relative order of objects with different colors. Since the initial combination did not occur correctly, the subsequent steps could not be evaluated properly.

Given the observations above, it appears that the transformation was not entirely applied correctly to the test input sequence. The primary issue lies in identifying and combining appropriate adjacent objects with the same color. Therefore, I would rate the test output as `4` out of 10 based on partial adherence to the expected transformation rules. It can be improved by accurately combining eligible adjacent objects with the same color.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation steps and the test input and output sequences provided, here is the evaluation and analysis:

1. In Step 1, identify objects in the input sequence based on non-zero pixel values.
   Test Input Objects: [{color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 7}, {color: 7, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 15}, {color: 7, start\_index: 17, end\_index: 17}, {color: 7, start\_index: 23, end\_index: 23}]

2. In Step 2, check if any two adjacent objects have the same color and are either surrounded by noise pixels or closely located.
   - Object at index 7 (start\_index=8, end\_index=15) and Object at index 8 (start\_index=17, end\_index=17) meet this condition since both have the same color (7), and there are noise pixels surrounding them.

3. In Step 3, combine those objects by merging their start and end indices while keeping the color value intact.
   New combined object: [{color: 7, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 17}]

4. In Step 4, repeat Steps 2 and 3 until no further combinations are possible. This combination satisfies the criteria so we won't proceed to another iteration.

5. In Step 5, fill in the gaps created due to object mergers with noise pixels (0's).
   Test Output Objects: [{color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 7}, {color: 7, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 17}, {color: 7, start\_index: 23, end\_index: 23}]

6. In Step 6, preserve the relative order of objects with different colors throughout the process. Since there is only one color present, this rule does not apply to this scenario.

Overall, it appears that the provided test output follows the specified transformation rules, but since there is only one color involved, further analyses regarding the maintenance of object orders cannot be fully evaluated. As such, I would rate the quality of the test output as a 9 out of 10 considering edge cases involving multiple colors could not be verified.
------
 Based on the provided information, here is the evaluation of the test output sequence:

First, let's go through each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

1. Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence based on non-zero pixel values. This step seems to be correctly applied because both the input and output sequences have the same non-zero pixel values, implying that objects were identified correctly.
2. Step 2: Check if any two adjacent objects have the same color and are either surrounded by noise pixels or closely located. It appears that this condition has been met since there are consecutive groups of 7's separated by noise pixels in the input sequence, and these groups of 7's have merged in the output sequence.
3. Step 3: Combine those objects by merging their start and end indices while keeping the color value intact. From the input and output sequences comparison, it can be seen that this step has also been correctly applied. Consecutive groups of 7's have been combined in the output sequence.
4. Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no further combinations are possible. As per the previous steps, this condition seems to have been satisfied too.
5. Step 5: Fill in the gaps created due to object mergers with noise pixels (0's). In the output sequence, there are indeed noise pixels filling in the gaps where object mergers occurred, indicating that this step was correctly applied.
6. Step 6: Preserve the relative order of objects with different colors throughout the process. Since there is only one type of object (with color 7), this condition does not apply directly to this specific test case. However, in general, this condition would require checking whether objects with different colors maintain their relative order.

Based on the above analysis, we can rate the test output sequence with a score of 9 out of 10 because although most of the steps seem to be correctly applied, without explicitly testing the last condition involving different colored objects, it cannot be guaranteed that the entire algorithm works well for more complex scenarios. A lower score could be assigned if there were issues found in earlier steps; however, no such problems were detected.#############################

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation steps.

1. Identify objects and their properties, including position, color, and size:
   * Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   * Objects identified:
     - Object 1 (Color 7): starts at index 2, ends at index 11, length = 10
     - Object 2 (Color 7): starts at index 16, ends at index 16, length = 1
     - Object 3 (Color 0): found between Object 1 and Object 2, consisting of several sub-objects:
       * Sub-object A: starts at index 13, ends at index 13, length = 1
       * Sub-object B: starts at index 14, ends at index 15, length = 2

2. Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color:
   * Group 1 (Color 7): consists of Objects 1 and 2
   
3. Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining:
   * Group 1 (Color 7): is not completely surrounded by noise pixels but has noise pixels positioned closely. It can still be combined since it satisfies either condition.

4. Combine eligible groups of objects by merging their positions while preserving their shared color:
   * Group 1 (Color 7): merged positions form [2, 16], resulting in [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

5. Sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions:
   * After sorting, there are no objects left because we already merged them in Step 4.

Given the above evaluation based on the provided transformation steps, I would rate the test output sequence as a 10 out of 10 since it successfully identifies, combines, and sorts the objects according to the rules given. Here is the JSON response:
```json

  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps. Here is the original input sequence for comparison:

input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Let's examine the transformation steps one by one:

1. Identify objects and their properties, including position, color, and size:
   - There are three groups of consecutive sevens (objects):
     A: Position 2-6, Color 7, Size 5;
     B: Position 7-13, Color 7, Size 7;
     C: Position 18-18, Color 7, Size 1;
2. Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color:
   - Three groups found in step 1 remain separate since they are already adjacent and sharing the same color.
3. Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining:
   - Neither group has any noise pixels around it nor are they placed closely enough to combine.
4. Combine eligible groups of objects by merging their positions while preserving their shared color:
   - No eligible groups to combine based on our previous conclusion.
5. Sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions:
   - Given there were no combinations made, we do not need this step. However, even without sorting, objects A, B, and C would still retain their relative order due to non-combination anyway.

Considering the above examination, the transformation was not done correctly because:

- Groups A and C should not have been combined as they are separated by a non-noise pixel.
- Outputting zeros at the beginning before the first seven appears in the input seems incorrect.

Therefore, the given output does not follow the correct application of the provided transformation rules.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation steps and the test input sequence, here is the analysis of the test output sequence:

1. Identify objects and their properties: In the test input, there are three main groups of objects: (i) Group A: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]; (ii) Group B: [7]; and (iii) Group C: [7].
2. Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color: As expected, Groups B and C can be combined with Group A since they share the same color. However, note that Groups B and C are already adjacent to Group A without any noise in between them, so technically speaking, they do not meet the requirement of being completely surrounded by noise pixels. But it seems like we can still combine these groups based on the problem description.
3. Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining: Since Groups B and C are not separated from Group A by noise pixels, this could potentially be seen as incorrect combination. Nevertheless, let us continue with the remaining steps assuming the combination has been performed correctly.
4. Combine eligible groups of objects by merging their positions while preserving their shared color: After combining Groups B and C with Group A, the updated group would look like: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7].
5. Sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions: This step doesn't really apply, as we don't need to sort anything after merging.

Given our analysis, though there appears to be deviation from the overall pattern of combining objects only when they are completely surrounded by noise pixels, the general idea behind the test output sequence holds true to the objective of combining objects of the same color. Considering the provided context, I will rate the test output as:

{
	"test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.",
	"value": 7
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we need to identify objects and their properties in both the input and output sequences. In this case, there are three objects in the input sequence:

1. Color: 7, Start Index: 2, End Index: 9, Size: 8
2. Color: 7, Start Index: 14, End Index: 14, Size: 1
3. Color: 7, Start Index: 19, End Index: 19, Size: 1

In the output sequence, we can observe two objects based on the same criteria:

1. Color: 7, Start Index: 2, End Index: 9, Size: 8
2. Color: 7, Start Index: 14, End Index: 14, Size: 1

Now, let's examine how the transformation is being performed using the given transformation steps:

Step 1: Identified objects and their properties, including position, color, and size.
Step 2: We see that objects with color 7 at indices 14 and 19 are grouped in the output sequence since they have the same color. This matches our expected behavior.
Step 3: According to the description and the overall pattern, these groups do not seem to meet any specific conditions for combining since they are not completely surrounded by noise pixels or positioned closely. However, it appears that adjacent objects with the same color are combined regardless of these conditions. Here, we will consider two sub-steps: (a) combine objects without considering the special conditions mentioned, and (b) follow the original intention of the overall pattern, evaluating the conditions before merging.
	* Sub-step (a): If we merely focus on combining objects with the same color, then the transformation seems correct because the resulting output sequence has been produced by merging the matched objects.
	* Sub-step (b): Let's evaluate the conditions for combining objects more specifically. In this case, neither the first nor the second object is completely surrounded by noise pixels. Also, they aren't positioned very closely. Thus, the test output does not fully adhere to the described conditions.
Step 4 & Step 5: Since the transformation process in step 3 deviated from the intended rules, further operations like determining the new position after merging and sorting the final set of objects become irrelevant.

Considering the inconsistencies found during the evaluation, the output sequence partially follows the specified transformation steps but does not comply entirely with the stated conditions. Therefore, I recommend giving a lower rating, such as a '4'. An ideal rating would depend upon the importance placed on strictly following the conditions versus simply achieving the desired output sequence.

  'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. During the examination, several discrepancies were identified between the input, test output, and stated patterns.',

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation steps and the description of the overall pattern, let's evaluate the test output sequence.

Step 1: Identify objects and their properties, including position, color, and size.

For the input sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can identify two distinct objects: {color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 13} and {color: 7, start\_index: 18, end\_index: 18}. These objects meet the criteria specified in Step 1.

Step 2: Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color.

There is only one group of adjacent objects with the same color in this case: [{color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 13}]. This group meets the criteria specified in Step 2.

Step 3: Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining: check whether they are completely surrounded by noise pixels or positioned closely.

In this case, the single group of adjacent objects [7, 7, 7,..., 7] does not satisfy either criterion because it starts at index 2 (not immediately after a noise pixel), ends before the last noise pixel at index 19 (and thus not completely surrounded by noise pixels). Therefore, there is no need to proceed to Step 4 for this group. Since these are the only identified objects, further analysis isn't required.

Comparing the proposed test output [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] against the original input, it appears that the transformation has been incorrectly applied in the sense that adjacent objects were combined even though they did not meet the stated criteria in the problem description.

As per the given instructions, here's the required output:

{"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence."
"value": 0}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.

Step 1: Identify objects and their properties, including position, color, and size.
For the given input, there are three objects:

* Object 1 (7), starts at position 2, ends at position 9, has a size of 8.
* Object 2 (7), starts at position 14, ends at position 14, has a size of 1.
* Object 3 (7), starts at position 19, ends at position 20, has a size of 2.

Step 2: Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color.
There is one group of adjacent objects: Object 1 and Object 3 (since they share the same color).

Step 3: Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining.
Both Object 1 and Object 3 are not completely surrounded by noise pixels, but they are positioned closely. They meet the criteria to be combined.

Step 4: Combine eligible groups of objects by merging their positions while preserving their shared color.
Combining Object 1 and Object 3 results in a single object:

* Merged Object (7), starts at position 2, ends at position 20, has a size of 19.

Step 5: Sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions.
Since we already have one object left after combining them, no further sorting is needed.

Now, let's compare the resulting merged object with the test output:

* Test Output Object (7), starts at position 2, ends at position 20, has a size of 19.

Based on this comparison, it appears that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. To ensure accuracy, it would still be beneficial to implement the described algorithm and verify the result using automated testing. However, based on the available information, I can rate the test output sequence as a 10.

overall pattern: Combine adjacent objects with the same color, preserving their color, when they are completely surrounded by noise pixels or positioned closely; otherwise, keep objects separate and maintain the relative order of differently colored objects.


transformation steps: [{'step': 'Identify objects and their properties, including position, color, and size.'}, {'step': 'Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color.'}, {'step': 'Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining: check whether they are completely surrounded by noise pixels or positioned closely.'}, {'step': 'Combine eligible groups of objects by merging their positions while preserving their shared color.'}, {'step': 'Sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions.'}]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

First, let's identify objects and their properties in the test input sequence:
[
  {color: 0, start\_index: 0, end\_index: 1, size: 2},
  {color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 9, size: 8},
  {color: 7, start\_index: 10, end\_index: 16, size: 7},
  {color: 7, start\_index: 22, end\_index: 22, size: 1},
  {color: 0, start\_index: 23, end\_index: 41, size: 19}
]

Next, we analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color:
[
  [{color: 0, start\_index: 0, end\_index: 1, size: 2}],
  [{color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 16, size: 15},{color: 7, start\_index: 22, end\_index: 22, size: 1}],
  [{color: 0, start\_index: 23, end\_index: 41, size: 19}]
]

Now, determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining. In this case, both groups of color 7 meet the condition since they are adjacent and there is no non-noise pixel between them. We combine these two groups:

[
  [{color: 0, start\_index: 0, end\_index: 1, size: 2}],
  [{color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 22, size: 21}],
  [{color: 0, start\_index: 23, end\_index: 41, size: 19}]
]

Finally, sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions:

[
  [{color: 0, start\_index: 0, end\_index: 1, size: 2}],
  [{color: 7, start\_index: 2, end\_index: 22, size: 21}],
  [{color: 0, start\_index: 23, end\_index: 41, size: 19}]
]

Comparing the sorted list of objects with the test output sequence shows that the test output sequence does not follow the expected combined and sorted sequence. Therefore, it seems likely that the transformation was not applied correctly, based on the given rules.

As a result, the JSON response will be:
{
  'test\_output\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.',
  'value': 3
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps. We will analyze each step of the transformation algorithm to determine if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

1. Identify objects and their properties, including position, color, and size.
   - In the test input sequence, we can identify the following objects:
     ```css
     [Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 2, end_index: 7, size: 6}]
     [Object_2: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 13, size: 6}]
     [Object_3: {color: 7, start_index: 14, end_index: 14, size: 1}]
     [Object_4: {color: 7, start_index: 28, end_index: 28, size: 1}]
     ```
2. Analyze object adjacency and group objects with the same color.
   - Since there is only one non-zero value (noise pixel) separating Object\_1 and Object\_2, they can be considered adjacent. However, there is no need to group them yet because we haven't checked the conditions for combination.
3. Determine if each group of adjacent objects meets the condition for combining: check whether they are completely surrounded by noise pixels or positioned closely.
   - Let's consider the distance between the two adjacent objects. There are 14 indices between the ending index of Object\_1 and the starting index of Object\_2 (excluding the single noise pixel). Given that this distance is more than half of the length of the combined objects, it doesn't meet the criteria for being close enough to combine them.
4. Combine eligible groups of objects by merging their positions while preserving their shared color.
   - No combinations were found necessary in the previous step. Therefore, there aren't any changes required here either.
5. Sort the final set of objects in ascending order according to their starting positions.
   - As there were no changes made during the combination process, the sorting step would also remain unchanged.

Given our analysis of each transformation step, the test output sequence does not appear to be the correct result of applying the transformation algorithm to the test input sequence. It seems like the test output is missing the second group of consecutive sevens (Object\_2), as it has been replaced by noise pixels instead of merged properly with Object\_1. The correct test output sequence should look like:
```json
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Therefore, based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as `1`, indicating that the majority of the output contains the correct information but lacks proper handling of the specific scenario involving adjacent objects separated by just one noise pixel.
