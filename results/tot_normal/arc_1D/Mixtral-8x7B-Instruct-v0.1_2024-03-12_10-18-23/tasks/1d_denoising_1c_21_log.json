The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Since there can only be noise pixels and objects in the sequence, this step involves simply finding the indices of the first and last non-noise pixel for each object.\n* Step 2: Check if there's only one object. If yes, stop processing as per the description.\n* Step 3: Find the two closest objects. Calculate the distances between adjacent objects and choose the pair with the minimum distance.\n* Step 4: Merge the chosen pair of objects by moving them closer together. This can result in overlapping objects, but since they share the same color, it is acceptable. After merging, update the object metadata accordingly.\n* Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until only one object remains. As the number of objects decreases after merging, eventually, there will be only one object left in the sequence. Once reached, we can stop.\n------\n Based on the given examples and the overall pattern, here are the general transformation steps to convert the input sequence into the output sequence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"Multiple objects of the same color value are present in the input sequence.\",\n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify all objects of the same color value in the input sequence.\",\n    \"Step 2: Sort the identified objects based on their starting index positions.\",\n    \"Step 3: Starting from the first object, check if there is another object immediately after it with a higher ending index position.\",\n    \"Step 4: Merge the two adjacent objects into one larger object covering both their ranges.\",\n    \"Step 5: Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 until no more merging is possible.\",\n    \"Step 6: After merging all eligible objects, update the final output sequence with the merged objects and preserve the original color value.\"\n  ]\n}\n```#############################\nNext node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Since there are no conflicting color values or noise pixels, the transformation works perfectly, resulting in a simplified output sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"In Example_2, we see that the transformation merges contiguous blocks of identical objects. However, it prioritizes horizontal alignment over vertical alignment, meaning that some vertically aligned blocks do not get merged. Nonetheless, the transformation accurately captures the intended behavior described in the overall pattern.\",\n    \"value\": 8\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, the transformation steps work well for Example_3 since there are no conflicting color values or noise pixels.

Still, their effectiveness varies depending on the configuration of input data due to differences in horizontal vs. vertical alignments. I rated them out of 10 considering this limitation but otherwise found them accurate according to the problem statement.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

However, I can still describe how the test input sequence would be transformed according to the given rules.\n\nTransformation process:\n\nStep 1: Identify contiguous blocks of identical objects based on their color value and position.\n- Block 1: [0, 0, 0] (color 0)\n- Block 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (color 1)\n- Block 3: [1] (color 1)\n- Block 4: [1] (color 1)\n- Block 5: [0, 0, 0] (color 0)\n- Block 6: [1] (color 1)\n- Block 7: [0, 0, 0] (color 0)\n- Block 8: [1] (color 1)\n- Block 9: [0] (color 0)\n\nStep 2: Check if there are any adjacent blocks with the same color value. There are, so proceed to Step 3.\n\nStep 3: Combine horizontally or vertically aligned adjacent blocks of identical objects depending on their orientation.\n- Since horizontal alignment combines the full width, Block 2 and Block 3 will merge into a larger block containing [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n- Similarly, Block 2 and Block 4 will also merge resulting in a block containing [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].\n- No further combinations are possible since vertical alignments do not meet the condition for combining heights.\n\nStep 4: Remove all remaining non-background objects, leaving only object_0 (color 0) in the output sequence.\n- Remaining blocks: [0, 0, 0], merged Block 2 (now twice as large due to merging with both Block 3 & 4), Block 5, Block 6, Block 7, Block 8, and Block 9.\n- After applying this step, all non-background objects will be removed, leaving just the background color: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, without a valid test output sequence, it's impossible to confirm if the transformation was applied correctly.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze how they would be applied to the test input sequence. Then we will rate the test output. However, since the expected test output is 'None', it implies that no changes should be made to the input sequence, i.e., the output should remain the same as the input for this particular test case.\n\nLet's examine the transformation steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify contiguous blocks of identical objects based on their color value and position. This can be done using techniques such as iterating through the array and checking the current element against the previous one.\n\nFor the test input sequence, the contiguous blocks of identical objects are:\n- Block 1: [0, 0, 0]\n- Block 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n- Block 3: [1]\n- Block 4: [0, 0, 0]\n- Block 5: [1]\n- Block 6: [0, 0, 0]\n- Block 7: [1]\n- Block 8: [0]\n\nStep 2: Check if there are any adjacent blocks with the same color value. Yes, there are. Proceed to Step 3.\n\nStep 3: Combine horizontally or vertically aligned adjacent blocks of identical objects depending on their orientation. Since the adjacency is horizontal, combine the full width of the blocks.\n\nCombined blocks:\n- Merged Block 1 & 2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n- Merged Block 3, 5, and 7: [1, 1, 1]\n- Remaining blocks: [0, 0, 0], [0]\n\nStep 4: Remove all remaining non-background objects, leaving only object_0 (color 0) in the output sequence.\n\nMerged Block 1 & 2 has both zeros and ones but is considered a single combined block. Therefore, remove all non-zero elements from it:\n\n- Final Result: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHowever, we were told that the expected output is 'None'. Comparing our result with the expected output, the actual test output does not match since extra modification occurred during the evaluation process. We followed the given transformation steps exactly as described, resulting in completely eliminating non-zero elements. It appears that the given instructions don't cover the special case where the entire test input sequence consists only of a single contiguous block. Thus, I recommend being cautious about applying these transformation steps generically without considering edge cases like this one.\n\nWith this analysis in mind, here's the final verdict:\n\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

Step 1: In the test input sequence, contiguous blocks of identical objects are identified. There are four such blocks: [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1,..., 1], [0, 0, 0], and [1].\n2. Step 2: Two adjacent horizontal blocks of the same color value are found: [1, 1, 1,..., 1]. Since this condition is met, we proceed to Step 3.\n3. Step 3: These horizontally adjacent objects of the same color (1) are combined by replacing them with a single object of the same color (1) in the output sequence. However, it seems like multiple instances of the same color should have been merged based on the description, but the provided output does not reflect this. Instead of having a single instance of [1] after combining, it appears twice in the output sequence, which is incorrect according to the rules explained.\n\nSince the provided test output sequence doesn't follow the correct merging rule mentioned in the instructions, I cannot rate it highly. A correct implementation would merge consecutive equal elements into a single element while maintaining their original value. Based on the analysis provided above, I would give the following rating:\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Incorrectly transformed the test input sequence. Multiple instances of the same color were not merged into a single instance, violating the described transformation rules.', 'value': '3'}\n------\n Here's the evaluation of the given test output sequence:\n\n1. Step 1: Identify contiguous blocks of identical objects in the input sequence.\n   - Input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n   - Blocks identified: [(0, 3), (3, 13), (13, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20)]\n\n2. Step 2: Check if two or more identical objects are adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n   - Since the blocks are already identified, we know that there are no horizontal or vertical adjacencies between different blocks.\n\n3. Step 3: Combine horizontally or vertically adjacent objects of the same color by replacing them with a single object of the same color in the output sequence.\n   - As mentioned, there are no horizontal or vertical adjacencies between different blocks. Therefore, this step doesn't apply here.\n\n4. Step 4: Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until no further combinations are possible.\n   - No repetition needed because we don't need to combine anything based on previous steps.\n\n5. Step 5: Fill the remaining positions in the output sequence with the background color (0).\n   - Test Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at both the final test output and the provided transformation steps, it seems like some steps were skipped during processing. Specifically, after Step 1, there would normally be multiple blocks containing identical objects separated by the background color (0). However, the test output combines those blocks without apparent reason. Based on the given rules, applying only Step 5 wouldn't result in such a drastic reduction of non-background objects.\n\nRating: 3/10. Although the final result does resemble the expected output visually, the actual transformation wasn't followed according to the guidelines provided.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

We will follow each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\nStep 1: Identify contiguous blocks of identical objects in the input sequence. Each identified block can be considered an individual unit.\nFor our test input, we find the following blocks: [(0, 1), (1, 16), (0, 1), (1, 3), (0, 1)]\n\nStep 2: Check if two or more identical objects are adjacent horizontally or vertically. If so, proceed to Step 3. Otherwise, do nothing since each identified object forms a separate block in the output sequence.\nWe observe horizontal adjacency between blocks (0, 1), (1, 16), and (0, 1). No vertical adjacencies exist among the identified blocks. So we move forward to Step 3.\n\nStep 3: Combine horizontally or vertically adjacent objects of the same color by replacing them with a single object of the same color in the output sequence.\nSince we found only horizontal adjacency between blocks (0, 1), (1, 16), and (0, 1), we check their sizes: 1, 16, and 1. Since they don't belong to the same group based on the provided description, combining blocks isn't necessary at this stage. Therefore, it seems like something went wrong during this transformation step.\n\nAs we detected inconsistencies in applying Step 3, the whole transformation process appears flawed. To better understand the issue, let us examine how the specific rules were applied to the blocks mentioned above. However, even without diving deeper, it's clear that there's a mistake in the transformation since step 3 wasn't supposed to apply here according to the problem definition.\n\nDue to this discrepancy, I cannot provide a definitive rating between 0 and 10. But considering the observed error, it would be reasonable to question the validity of both the transformation process and the resulting test output. A thorough review is required to determine the correctness of the entire approach before assigning a numerical score.\n\nIn summary,\n{'test_output_analysis': 'The given test output shows signs of incorrect transformation as per the described algorithm. Specifically, step 3 seems to have been erroneously applied. Further investigation is needed to assess the accuracy of the transformation methodology and assign a reliable rating.', 'value': 'N/A'}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each step of the transformation algorithm and determine if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\n**Step 1:** Identify contiguous blocks of identical objects in the input sequence. Each identified block can be considered an individual unit.\n- Applied correctly to both input and output sequences.\n\n**Step 2:** Check if two or more identical objects are adjacent horizontally or vertically. If so, proceed to Step 3. Otherwise, do nothing since each identified object forms a separate block in the output sequence.\n- Not applicable here since there are no adjacent identical objects after applying Step 1.\n\n**Step 3:** Combine horizontally or vertically adjacent objects of the same color by replacing them with a single object of the same color in the output sequence.\n- It seems like this step has not been followed consistently, resulting in some inconsistencies.\n\n**Step 4:** Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until no further combinations are possible. This ensures that all eligible groups of objects have been combined in the output sequence.\n- Since Step 3 hasn't been applied properly, it also affects Step 4, making it difficult to evaluate accurately.\n\n**Step 5:** Fill the remaining positions in the output sequence with the background color (0).\n- Applied correctly to the output sequence.\n\nGiven our analysis, we cannot confidently assert the proper application of most transformation steps and therefore must provide a conservative assessment.\n\nValue: **3** (out of 10) - Although the final output sequence appears visually consistent with the expected output, several key transformation steps seem overlooked or misapplied throughout the process."
