Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all input sequences, there is always exactly one object. This object may be split into multiple smaller objects in the output sequence.\noutput: Output sequences either contain no objects (consisting entirely of noise pixels), or contain one or more objects that are subsets of the original object(s) in the input sequence.\n\n\n\noverall pattern: None\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Here's the JSON response based on the given information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the condition about the existence of exactly one object in the input is met. However, this condition alone isn't sufficient to determine how the object might change since it doesn't consider specific features like shape, size, or location.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the provided overall pattern ('None') does not describe any relationship between the input and output sequences.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, without an explicit pattern, it's impossible to determine whether the pattern is precise enough for generating a correct output for a new input.\",\n    \"value\": 3\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, the condition about the existence of exactly one object is met, but again, it does not provide enough information to predict the object's behavior.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"For both Examples_1 and _2, the provided overall pattern remains 'None', lacking any guidance for understanding the connection between the input and output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"As previously stated, without a clear pattern, precision cannot be evaluated.\",\n    \"value\": 3\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, we rate the information and patterns provided as `3` out of 10 due to insufficient clarification on the rules governing the transformation from input to output. A value closer to 10 would require detailed explanations covering aspects such as splitting or merging rules, location variations, and other factors influencing the relationships between consecutive frames.\n------\n Here's the JSON format response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the given condition about the input (exactly one object) indeed refers only to the input and is relevant to determine the object changes. However, the condition does not specify whether the object can be split into multiple smaller objects or not.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the given overall pattern does not describe the transformation from input to output since it doesn't provide any information about how the pixels should change.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the given overall pattern is not precise enough to transform a new input to its output because it lacks clear rules for modifying the pixels.\",\n    \"value\": 3\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, the given condition about the input (exactly one object) is relevant to determine the object changes. But, like before, it doesn't specify whether the object can be split into multiple smaller objects or not.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, the given overall pattern still does not describe the transformation from input to output, as it fails to capture the specific changes in pixels.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, the given overall pattern remains imprecise for transforming a new input to its output due to the absence of clear modification rules.\",\n    \"value\": 3\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, the given condition about the input (exactly one object) is again relevant to determine the object changes. Yet, it still lacks specification about splitting the object into smaller ones.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, just like in previous cases, the given overall pattern does not describe the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, the given overall pattern continues to be insufficiently precise for transforming a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 3\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that the provided conditions do not give enough guidance on how to modify the pixels according to the desired output. There needs to be an additional rule or pattern specified in order to accurately relate the input and output sequences."

In Step 1, we need to find the starting and ending indices of the object in the input sequence. Here, the object is represented by color 2, so the object ranges from index 4 to 29 in the input sequence.\n2. Next, in Step 2, we look for blocks of noise pixels within the object. We can see three blocks of consecutive zeros: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 0].\n3. Now, according to Step 3 and 4, we should process each block of noise pixels separately. However, when looking closely at both the input and output sequences, it seems like the first two blocks were merged into a single object instead of being kept separate as required by the overall pattern.\n\t* Block 1 (indices 0-3): Should result in four individual 0s in the output sequence, but instead, it's treated as part of the initial object.\n\t* Block 2 (indices 22-24): These should be separate from the long sequence of 2s since they follow another block of noise pixels, but they're included in the final object spanning from index 16 to 28 in the output sequence.\n4. For Step 5, we verify whether all blocks of noise pixels have been processed correctly. As mentioned earlier, the first two blocks of noise pixels weren't processed independently. So, the answer would be \"no\" for this step.\n5. Finally, in Step 6, we check if the input object ends with noise pixels and if they are treated as separate objects in the output sequence. Since we already found issues in previous steps, we cannot proceed with evaluating this step without addressing the problems encountered earlier.\n\nTo summarize our findings, there seem to be inconsistencies with processing blocks of noise pixels within the main object according to the given rules, particularly regarding the separation of distinct blocks of noise pixels. Thus, the test output sequence does not appear to correctly apply the specified transformation to the test input sequence.\n\nAs a result, the JSON response will be constructed as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 3\n}\n```\n\nA rating of 3 indicates significant deviations from the expected transformation results based on the observed discrepancies in applying the rules.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation steps:\n\n1. Identify the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence.\n   - In the test input, the single object starts at index 4 and ends at index 29.\n2. Identify any blocks of noise pixels (consecutive zeros) within this object, including at the beginning and end of the object.\n   - There are three blocks of noise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0] at the beginning, [0, 0, 0] at the end, and [0, 2, 0, 2] inside the object.\n3. For each block of noise pixels identified, extract the subsequence of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels.\n   - Extracted subsequences: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 2].\n4. Create a new object in the output sequence using these extracted noise pixels.\n   - Created objects: [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], and [0, 2].\n\nNow let's compare the test output sequence with the expected result based on the transformation steps:\n\nTest output:     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nExpected output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nComparing the two sequences reveals that the first and last blocks of noise pixels were handled correctly. However, the inner block of consecutive zeros ([0, 2]) was incorrectly separated from the neighboring colored pixels. Instead, it should have remained part of the previous colored pixel sequence. Therefore, the current implementation does not follow Step 6 accurately in handling the case where the input object ends with noise pixels.\n\nAs a consequence, I would rate the test output quality as 6 out of 10, considering the correct treatment of most noise pixel blocks but the failure to adhere strictly to the specified pattern in one instance.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Based on our analysis, we will provide a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as an integer.\n\n1. Step 1: In the input sequence, the single object starts at index 4 and ends at index 29, which matches the first appearance of digit 2 till its last appearance.\n2. Step 2: There are two blocks of noise pixels within the object: indices 0-3 (before the object), indices 30-32 (after the object), and indices 10-11 and 27-28 (between parts of the object).\n3. Step 3 & 4: The first block of noise pixels results in creating a noise object [0, 0, 0, 0]. The second block of noise pixels does not result in a new object since it's part of the already existing noise at the tail of the input object. However, per Step 6, this should be considered separately. So, additional noise objects created are [0, 0] and [0].\n4. Combining the non-noise portions of the input object, three distinct objects remain: [2, 2, 2], [2], and [2].\n5. Comparing the expected output and obtained output shows correspondence for non-noise portions; however, the noise objects seem misrepresented. Instead of an array representation, they are individual numbers. It seems like a serialization issue when converting NumPy arrays to JSON format.\n\nTo overcome this problem, let's convert the NumPy arrays to lists before returning the JSON object.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef convert_numpy_to_list(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, np.ndarray):\n        return obj.tolist()\n    elif isinstance(obj, dict):\n        return {k: convert_numpy_to_list(v) for k, v in obj.items()}\n    elif isinstance(obj, list):\n        return [convert_numpy_to_list(o) for o in obj]\n    else:\n        return obj\n\nresult = {'test_output_analysis': 'See points above', 'value': 8}\nreturn convert_numpy_to_list(result)\n```\n\nWith this change, our evaluation returns the desired output considering all the steps in the transformation process.\n\nOutput: `{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 8}`\n------\n To evaluate the given test output sequence, we will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\n1. In Step 1, the starting index and ending index of the single object present in the input sequence must be identified. In the test case, the object starts at index 4 and ends at index 28. Since the entire algorithm depends on accurately identifying the object, it's crucial to confirm that the correct indices were found. It appears that the object has been correctly identified.\n2. Step 2 requires us to identify blocks of noise pixels within the object, including at the beginning and end. We can see that there are three blocks of noise pixels in the test case: [0, 0, 0] at the beginning of the object, another [0, 0] block towards the middle, and finally [0, 0] at the end.\n3. Step 3 directs us to extract subsequences of pixels consisting only of those noise pixels for each block of noise pixels identified. Based on our understanding of the previous steps, the extraction process seems to be accurate; however, without explicit confirmation in the problem statement, we cannot say for certain.\n4. Step 4 instructs creating a new object in the output sequence using the extracted noise pixels for each block identified. Here are the expected new objects based on the problem description:\n   - Noise Pixel Block 1: [0, 0, 0]\n   - Noise Pixel Block 2: [0, 0]\n   - Noise Pixel Block 3: [0, 0]\n5. Comparing the output provided against the expected new objects in Step 4:\n   - Noise Pixel Block 1: Matches the first element in the output array: [array([0, 0, 0])].\n   - Noise Pixel Block 2: Missing in the output. However, since Step 6 instructs treating ending noise pixels separately, let's examine this further.\n   - Noise Pixel Block 3: Matches the last element in the output array: [array([2]), array([0, 0])]. Although the second-to-last element contains [2], which doesn't match the exact noise pixel block, considering Step 6, this might still be considered valid.\n6. Examining Step 6, ending noise pixels need to be treated as separate objects in the output sequence. In the test case, since the third noise pixel block consists of two pixels instead of one, it could be argued that both noise pixels should be separated into their own arrays. However, there isn't enough information in the problem statement to make a definitive decision regarding the validity of merging consecutive noise pixels during this final step.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in handling consecutive noise pixels at the very end of the input object, we cannot provide a definite rating. Instead, we recommend reviewing Step 6 and clarifying how to handle such cases by explicitly stating whether to merge consecutive noise pixels or keep them separate. With that clarification, a proper rating would be determined.\n\n{\n  'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

In this case, the noise pixels are located at the beginning, between the first two groups of 2s, and at the end of the input sequence.\n\nNext, for each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, we create a new object containing just those pixels in the output. However, in the test output, we see that the first group of three zeros has been combined with the second group of three zeros. This violates the overall pattern described earlier, as these should be treated as separate blocks of noise pixels and therefore separate objects in the output.\n\nLastly, if an object ends with noise pixels, we treat them as separate objects in the output. In the test output, we can see that the last group of five twos has been followed by a single zero, but this zero has not been treated as a separate object.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we cannot say that the test output was obtained by applying the transformation correctly to the test input sequence. We would rate the accuracy of the test output as a 3 out of 10, as some aspects of the transformation were applied correctly, such as identifying the location of noise pixels and creating new objects for some blocks of noise pixels. However, the failure to properly distinguish between adjacent blocks of noise pixels significantly detracts from the quality of the output.\n\nOutput:\n{\n\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n\"value\": 3\n}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the test input sequence. We will consider each transformation step and check whether it has been correctly applied.\n\nStep 1: Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).\nIn this particular test case, noise pixels are present at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28. The input object starts at index 4 and ends at index 20. All noise pixels have been correctly identified.\n\nStep 2: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.\nThis step seems to have issues in the test output. In the actual output, four blocks of noise pixels are converted into objects; however, they do not correspond to any contiguous blocks found within the input object. Instead, these blocks seem arbitrary and don't match our expected result based on the description and overall pattern.\n\nStep 3: If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.\nThere isn't any clear application of this rule in the test output. It might require revisiting Step 2 properly, but since Step 2 contains errors, we cannot proceed to evaluating this specific step.\n\nOverall, it appears that the transformation procedure hasn't been followed accurately while generating the test output. Specifically, the conversion of noise pixel blocks to objects in the output needs improvement. To ensure accurate results, kindly review this process and revise the test output accordingly.\n\nTo summarize, here is the JSON response:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n  \"value\": 3\n}\n\nA value of 3 indicates a low level of compliance with the correct transformation rules based on the given description, overall pattern, and transformation steps.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Therefore, this step doesn't affect the sequence either.\n\nGiven these observations, we can conclude that the test output sequence follows the expected pattern. However, we notice that the first few zeros in the output seem unusual because the initial noise pixels aren't grouped together as their own object. To ensure the correctness of the result, further clarification might be needed regarding how to handle leading noise pixels when they're isolated.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we will rate the test output as:\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the given transformation steps, the test input sequence seems to have been correctly transformed into its test output sequence. But please note that there might be ambiguity in handling leading isolated noise pixels.', 'value': '8'}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the expected transformation patterns. We will go through each transformation step to determine whether the test output matches the expected results.\n\nTransformation Step 1: Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).\n\nLooking at the test input, the noise pixels are located at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33. These correspond to areas outside the object and some trailing pixels in the object.\n\nTransformation Step 2: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.\n\nIn this case, we don't see any blocks of noise pixels inside the main object itself; the noise pixels are mostly found before and after the object, except for an isolated section at position 14. Since there aren't any contiguous blocks of noise pixels within the input object, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\nTransformation Step 3: If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.\n\nHere, the last few elements of the object, starting from position 26, include noise pixels. According to the given rules, these should be treated as separate objects in the output. However, in the test output, they appear to be part of a single continuous object.\n\nGiven our analysis, it seems like the test output does not fully adhere to the specified transformation steps. It appears that the algorithm did not treat the final portion of the object properly as separate objects due to the existence of trailing noise pixels. Thus, based on this analysis, I would rate the accuracy of the test output sequence as a 5 out of 10 regarding correct application of the transformation.\n\nPlease consider revising the implementation according to the described transformation steps to ensure proper handling of all cases involving noise pixels related to objects in the input sequence.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

In the first block of noise pixels, the trailing zeros were extended beyond their actual length, whereas the rule suggests creating a new object only for the contiguous block of noise pixels.\n2. Additional objects were introduced at the end of the sequence without any apparent reason, since there are no noise pixels present there in the input sequence.\n3. There seems to be inconsistency in treating isolated noise pixels. While the rule implies that they should form part of a larger object that contains the noise pixels, here they appear as standalone objects.\n\nTaking these points into consideration, I would rate the quality of the transformation as 3 out of 10, due to several deviations from the suggested rules and lack of consistency in handling edge cases.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.\n\nFirst, we identify the locations of noise pixels relative to the input object(s):\n\nInput = [0, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0]\n\nNext, for each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, we create a new object containing just those pixels in the output:\n\nOutput = [0, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, **0**, **0**, **0**, **2**, 0, 0, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**, **0**]\n\nWe can see that the first part of the input object has been separated by noise pixels correctly in the output.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: Across all input sequences, there is always exactly one object. This object may be split into multiple smaller objects in the output sequence.\noutput: Output sequences either contain no objects (consisting entirely of noise pixels), or contain one or more objects that are subsets of the original object(s) in the input sequence.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The presence of noise pixels before, after, or between parts of the input object determines the distribution of objects in the output sequence.\noverall pattern: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output. If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s).',                          'For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output.',                          'If an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output.'                         ] \n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation pattern and steps.\n\nFirst, we identify the location of noise pixels (0s) relative to the non-noise pixels (2s) in the input sequence. We can see multiple blocks of noise pixels before, between, and after the main body of the input object.\n\nNext, we apply the second transformation step: For each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, create a new object containing just those pixels in the output. Here, we observe several issues with the test output sequence:\n\n1. At the beginning of the sequence, although there are noise pixels, they do not form their own object in the output. Instead, a `1` is inserted at the beginning of the sequence creating an incorrect object.\n2. After the first section of the input object (non-noise pixels), instead of inserting a single `1`, two `1`s are inserted, again forming an incorrect object.\n3. Towards the end of the sequence, the last group of non-noise pixels does not have any trailing noise pixels left untouched. According to step 3, these should be considered separate objects; however, this is not reflected in the test output.\n\nConsidering these discrepancies, it appears that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input sequence.\n\nOutput:\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Noise pixels at the beginning and middle of the input sequence were not separated into distinct objects, and the final segment of non-noise pixels did not have proper separation based on trailing noise pixels.', 'value': '4'}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we will identify the location of noise pixels relative to the input object(s):\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nNoise pixels: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nObjects: [[2, 6, 16, 30]]\n\nNow, for each contiguous block of noise pixels within the input object, we create a new object containing just those pixels in the output:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\nNew objects created from noise blocks: []\n\nFinally, if an object ends with noise pixels, treat them as separate objects in the output:\n\nIn this example, objects do not end with noise pixels, so this step does not apply.\n\nFrom our evaluation, it appears that most of the transformation steps were followed correctly; however, we notice that the first two '2's are isolated at position 6 and 8, while they should belong to the same object according to the transformation rules. Therefore, the correct output would look like this: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1].\n\nBased on this observation, we rate the test output as value: 7 out of 10."
