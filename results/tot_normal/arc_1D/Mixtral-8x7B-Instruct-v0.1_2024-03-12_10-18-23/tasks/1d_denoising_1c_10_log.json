The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence:\n   Examining the test input sequence, there are 33 pixels, so the iteration should cover every pixel in the input sequence.\n\n2. If the current pixel's value is 0, continue to the next pixel:\n   In the test input sequence, there are many instances where two consecutive zeros occur. It indicates multiple iterations would skip identical color values without affecting the other non-zero neighboring pixels.\n\n3. Identify the current pixel's object (if any) by checking its color value and neighboring pixels:\n   \n   Analyzing the test input sequence, several cases arise regarding the identification of an object related to the specific pixel:\n   * The first instance of color `2` starting at position 5 forms an object of length 8, with the same color on both sides, fulfilling the conditions mentioned above.\n   * Color `2` appears again at position 27 with no further appearance later in the sequence. Since it does not violate the conditions explained earlier, this too constitutes an individual object.\n\n4. Check if the identified object meets the condition of having neighbors of the same color on both sides or there being no preceding objects of the same color:\n   * First appearance of `2` satisfies this condition since it is surrounded by neighbors with matching colors. But when analyzing the second appearance of object `2`, it fails the condition because it has no subsequent same colored neighbor beyond itself.\n\n5. If the object meets the condition, retain its original color value in the output sequence at this index:\n   * Based on our previous findings, the first object consisting of eight consecutive `2`'s passes the condition, hence their respective positions must maintain the initial color value in the output.\n\n6. If the object does not meet the condition, change the pixel's value to 0 in the output sequence at this index:\n   * As discussed previously, the second series of `2` does not pass the condition, thus their corresponding places should contain zeros in the resulting output sequence.\n\nFrom the conducted examination, there seems to be inconsistency in applying Step 4 during the process. This discrepancy might have led to incorrect results for the test output sequence. Moreover, the second appearance of `2` did not satisfy the condition, meaning all of its associated elements should have been replaced with zeros in the final output sequence. However, upon comparing the expected outcome array with what was supplied, we find differences.\n\nSince the transformation was not accurately executed based on the described methodology, here is the judgment:\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was not properly transformed into its test output sequence. Specifically, the second occurrence of the object consisting solely of \"2\" failed the conditions but still retained its color instead of being replaced by zeros.', 'value': '3'}\n------\n To evaluate the correctness of the test output sequence, we will consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\n1. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence:\n   - This step appears to be correctly applied since the output has the same length as the input.\n\n2. If the current pixel's value is 0, continue to the next pixel:\n   - This step also seems correct because 0s remain unchanged in the output.\n\n3. Identify the current pixel's object (if any) by checking its color value and neighboring pixels:\n   - No issues found, but without actual implementation, it is hard to determine this precisely. We assume it to be implemented correctly based on test cases provided.\n\n4. Check if the identified object meets the condition of having neighbors of the same color on both sides or there being no preceding objects of the same color:\n   - In the test case, the first five 2s do not have a predecessor object of the same color (in fact, they don't even have a predecessor), so they should pass this condition. However, the last three 2s fail this condition due to the absence of successors. Therefore, these three 2s must be changed to 0 in the output sequence.\n\n5. If the object meets the condition, retain its original color value in the output sequence at this index:\n   - As mentioned earlier, some 2s were incorrectly converted to 0. So, it cannot be confirmed whether this step is followed precisely.\n\n6. If the object does not meet the condition, change the pixel's value to 0 in the output sequence at this index:\n   - Given the mistakes made in Step 4, we cannot confirm whether this step works fine.\n\nConsidering the above observations, the test output sequence fails the expected transformation rules. Based on the analysis, I would rate the test output a 3 out of 10, indicating noticeable discrepancies in applying the specified algorithmic steps.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

If the current pixel's value is 0, continue to the next pixel: This step is followed correctly because 0s remain unchanged in the output.\n3. Identify the current pixel's object (if any) by checking its color value and neighboring pixels: The first object starts at index 4 with color 2. It extends up to the second occurrence of color 2.\n4. Check if the identified object meets the condition of having neighbors of the same color on both sides or there being no preceding objects of the same color: In our case, the first object does not fulfill this condition. On the right side, the neighboring pixels after the object do not have the same color (indexes 16, 17, 18). However, starting from index 16, we find continuous pixels of color 2 satisfying the condition.\n5. Retain the object's original color value in the output sequence at this index: Starting from index 16, we observe continuous pixels of color 2 being retained as expected.\n6. Change the pixel's value to 0 in the output sequence at this index if the object doesn't meet the condition: From index 4 to 15, we see zeros instead of the initial object. This is correct according to step 5.\n7. Repeat until all the pixels have been processed: After applying the steps repeatedly, we obtain the final output sequence.\n\nBased on the analysis, let us rate the accuracy of the test output sequence generated considering the given input. We notice that the first object didn't satisfy the conditions provided, but subsequent ones did. Therefore, some discrepancies appear when comparing the expected and actual output. Overall, the transformation seems mostly accurate except for the incorrect handling of the first object. Considering this, I would rate the quality of the test output as a 6 out of 10 due to inconsistencies in applying the rules.\n------\n To evaluate the given test output sequence, we will consider each step of the provided transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence has been correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\n1. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence: This step appears to have been followed in the test case since both input and output sequences have the same length, indicating every pixel has been evaluated.\n2. If the current pixel's value is 0, continue to the next pixel: In the test case, there are consecutive zeros present in the output sequence, which suggests that the step was implemented properly.\n3. Identify the current pixel's object (if any): We see clear distinctions between regions of 2s and 0s, suggesting that objects were identified accurately during transformation.\n4. Check if the identified object meets the condition: Using the conditions specified in the overall pattern, it seems that some objects fulfill the condition while others do not. However, further investigation reveals an inconsistency with regard to the second condition \u2013 \"there being no preceding objects of the same color.\" In the test case output, we observe a transition from 0 to 2 without meeting this requirement. Thus, the test output fails to adhere strictly to the stated rules.\n5. Retain or change the pixel's value based on the condition: Since Step 4 wasn't executed correctly, determining whether this step was followed becomes difficult. However, considering the discrepancies observed earlier, it's unlikely that this step was carried out appropriately either.\n6. Repeat until all pixels have been processed: As noted previously, the resulting output shows signs of partial compliance but ultimately deviates from the expected outcome due to violations of Step 4. Therefore, complete processing according to the provided instructions did not occur.\n\nBased on this analysis, the test output cannot be deemed completely accurate as it doesn't comply with certain aspects of the described transformation process. Specifically, the handling of neighboring pixels and their impact on maintaining specific objects didn't appear consistent throughout the entire input sequence. Consequently, I would rate the test output a 3 out of 10 for demonstrating some understanding of the problem but failing to apply the necessary logic uniformly across the given input.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

In this test case, the following objects were identified:\n   - Object A: Pixels with value 2 starting at index 4 and ending at index 17.\n\n4. **Step 4** - Check if the identified object meets the condition: To do so, let us examine the boundaries and internal structure of Object A.\n   - At the left boundary (index 4), there are no preceding pixels of the same color since the previous pixel has a value of 0.\n   - Starting at index 5, however, there are pixels of the same color up until index 17.\n   Therefore, Object A partially meets the second condition but fails the first condition due to missing neighbors on the left side.\n\n5. **Step 5 & Step 6** - Retain the object's color or modify it depending on the outcome of Step 4: Since Object A failed to meet the condition of having neighbors of the same color on both sides, it must be changed to 0 in the output sequence.\n\nAfter examining the entire process, I can conclude that the correct output for the given test input should be:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, comparing the expected output against the one provided (\"None\" in this case), it becomes evident that the transformation wasn't applied correctly according to the rules specified.

For each pixel, find the starting and ending indices of its object:\n   - Pixel 5 (first 2): object = [{color: 2, start\\_index: 4, end\\_index: 5, size: 1}] (note that index is 0-based)\n   - Pixel 8 (last 2): object = [{color: 2, start\\_index: 7, end\\_index: 8, size: 1}]\n   - Other 2s form part of larger consecutive groups, so their objects will be [{color: 2, start\\_index: x, end\\_index: y, size: z}] where x,y,z depend on the group size and location.\n3. Check if the object has a neighbor of the same color on both sides or if there are no preceding objects of the same color:\n   - First 2 object doesn't meet this condition since its previous pixel is also 2 (same color). However, it does not have any preceding objects of the same color. So, it could go either way depending on how strictly we interpret the rules.\n   - Last 2 object does not meet the conditions at all, as there is another 2 before it.\n   - All other 2 objects will pass this condition since they are part of larger consecutive groups without any non-matching pixels in between.\n4. If the object meets the condition, keep it by setting its pixels to their original value: We would need to retain the pixels based on our decision in step 3.\n5. Otherwise, set all pixels of the object to 0: This will happen for any object that did not meet the condition determined in step 3.\n\nGiven the ambiguity around interpreting the rule about \"neighbors\" and considering the fact that the test output removes all 2s regardless of whether they meet the criteria completely or partially, I think the test output may not correctly reflect the intended transformation. It seems like the test output treats every appearance of object 2 uniformly as though none of them met the specified criteria, while some actually do meet the criteria partially.\n\nTherefore, my rating for the quality of the test output is 3 out of 10 because it does not carefully consider the individual cases and applies the removal indiscriminately even when some instances might qualify to be retained according to the stated rules.\n------\n To evaluate the test output sequence, we will consider each step of the provided transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\n\n1.

Check if the object has a neighbor of the same color on both sides or if there are no preceding objects of the same color:\n   Test Input: Failed (Incorrect handling of edges leading to removal of some valid objects)\n\n   Explanation: Consider the first group of `2`'s at positions 5 and 6. They meet the condition since there is a preceding object of the same color (position 4). However, they were still incorrectly set to 0 resulting in invalid deletion.\n\n4. If the object meets the condition, keep it by setting its pixels to their original value:\n   N/A (Since Step 3 had failures, this step did not apply correctly)\n\n5. Otherwise, set all pixels of the object to 0:\n   N/A (Since Step 3 had failures, this step also didn't apply correctly)\n\nBased on this analysis, I cannot provide a full evaluation of the test output sequence because there are errors found in the transformation process itself. Given the described flaw in handling objects near edge cases, more information would be needed about how the function deals with those scenarios before providing a final rating.

Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence:\n   Test Passed - Both input and output sequences contain the same number of pixels (32).\n\n2. For each pixel, find the starting and ending indices of its object:\n   This is an implementation detail, but assuming correct execution, this step passes because objects were identified correctly above.\n\n3. Check if the object has a neighbor of the same color on both sides or if there are no preceding objects of the same color:\n   - Object_1 in the input does not have a neighbor of the same color on both sides, but it doesn't matter since there are no preceding objects of the same color before it. Therefore, the condition holds true.\n   - Object_1 in the output also doesn't have a neighbor of the same color on both sides, but again, it doesn't matter since there are no preceding objects of the same color before it. The condition still holds true.\n\n4. If the object meets the condition, keep it by setting its pixels to their original value:\n   - In the input, Object_1 starts at index 4 and ends at index 18. All pixels are preserved with value 2.\n   - However, in the output, even though Object_1 starts at the correct index 7, it incorrectly skips the first appearance of 2 at index 6.\n\n5. Otherwise, set all pixels of the object to 0:\n   Since the condition held true for both objects, this step wouldn't apply to any pixel, so no judgment is made here.\n\nBased on the analysis, I cannot approve the transformation for the test output sequence due to the missing pixel with value 2 at index 6.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\\n\\nStep 4 failed.

We see that there are several instances of the number 2, indicating the presence of an object.\n\nNext, for each pixel, we find the starting and ending indices of its object. For simplicity, let's consider each consecutive group of 2's as a single object:\n\n* Object 1 starts at index 4 and ends at index 13 (size = 10)\n* Object 2 starts at index 26 and ends at index 27 (size = 2)\n\nNow, we check if each object fulfills the condition stated in the overall pattern: \"Objects are kept intact if they have neighbors of the same color on both sides or if there are no preceding objects of the same color.\" Let's examine each object individually:\n\n* Object 1 has the same color on both sides and satisfies the condition.\n* Object 2 does not have the same color on both sides but also doesn't have any preceding objects of the same color, so it still satisfies the condition.\n\nSince both objects satisfy the condition, we keep them by setting their pixels to their original value. This matches the test output sequence.\n\nFinally, we compare our analysis with the test output sequence, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since every object in the input sequence follows the specified rules and appears in the correct place within the output sequence, we can conclude that the transformation was applied correctly.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'After examining each step of the transformation algorithm, the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 10}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Remove Component 1 by setting its pixels to 0:\n\n   Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nGiven the correctness of our implementation, based on the described transformation algorithm, the test output seems incorrect. We would expect the algorithm to produce an empty sequence since no connected components met the criteria for being retained. However, the test output contains some non-zero elements that do not correspond to any of the preserved connected components.\n\nTherefore, I would rate the test output quality as '1'.\n------\n Based on the provided examples and information, let's evaluate the test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Here are the steps mentioned for the transformation:\n\n1. Iterate through each pixel in the input sequence.\n2. For each pixel, find the starting and ending indices of its object.\n3. Check if the object has a neighbor of the same color on both sides or if there are no preceding objects of the same color.\n4. If the object meets the condition, keep it by setting its pixels to their original value.\n5. Otherwise, set all pixels of the object to 0.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given test input and test output. We will ignore the first and last groups of 0s since neither of them forms an object.\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, **2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2** 2, **2**, 0, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, **2**, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1 & 2: Find objects and their indices: [[2, 7], [16, 18], [22, 23]]\n\nStep 3: Check conditions for objects:\n\n- [2, 7]: This object has the same color on both sides, so it meets the condition.\n- [16, 18]: This object does not meet the condition, since there is no preceding object of the same color, but having a neighbor of the same color on the right side is enough to satisfy the condition.\n- [22, 23]: This object does not meet the condition, as there are no preceding or succeeding objects of the same color.\n\nStep 4 & 5: Apply changes based on the conditions:\n\n- Keep [2, 7] (pixels remain unchanged)\n- Change [16, 18] to 0\n- Change [22, 23] to 0\n\nResulting Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, **2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2** 2, **0 0 0**, 0, 0, **0 0**, 0, 0, **0 0**, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHowever, this output does not match the given test output. It seems like the second object [16, 18] should not be removed completely, according to the conditions provided. There might be a mistake in interpreting the conditions or applying the transformation. Alternatively, there could be an error in the test output itself. Nevertheless, I cannot provide a numerical rating without deviating from the instructions given.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\\n\\nStep 1 and Step 2 were executed accurately. However, during Step 3, while checking the conditions for objects, there appears to be an issue when evaluating whether certain objects meet the specified criteria.
