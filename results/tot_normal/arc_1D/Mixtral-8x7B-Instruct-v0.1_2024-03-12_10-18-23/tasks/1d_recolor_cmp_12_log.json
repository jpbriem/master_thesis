The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}.

Nonetheless, it does capture the general structure of the output data, which consists of preserved background values and altered object values.\n------\n Based on the provided input-output pairs, here is an analysis of the descriptions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"input_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the input sequence [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] can be divided into objects based on adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects would be represented as follows: [Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 6, end_index: 10, size: 5}, Object_3: {color: 1, start_index: 12, end_index: 14, size: 3}]. However, the current description does not provide any guidance about how to transform the input sequence into the output sequence.\",\n    \"output_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the output sequence [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] contains new object labels (specifically, the label 2) that do not appear in the input sequence. This suggests that the input objects are being merged or aggregated in some way to form the output objects, but again, the current description provides no guidance about this process.\",\n    \"value\": \"2\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"input_analysis\": \"Same as Example_1\",\n    \"output_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] has new object labels (the label 2) that were created by merging the original input objects. However, we still don't have enough information to explain why certain input objects were merged while others were left unchanged.\",\n    \"value\": \"2\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"input_analysis\": \"Again, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] can be divided into objects such as [Object_1: {color: 1, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}, Object_2: {color: 1, start_index: 5, end_index: 7, size: 3}] etc., but there is no clear explanation of what constitutes a valid transformation.\",\n    \"output_analysis\": \"In the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the second object was replaced with the new label 2, which could indicate that two consecutive single-pixel objects were combined to become one larger object. But once more, we lack sufficient context to confirm or deny this hypothesis.\",\n    \"value\": \"2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, I rated the descriptions as a 2 because the given descriptions provide absolutely no insight on the problem domain or the rules governing the transformation from input to output sequences. Without further clarification or description, it would be impossible to identify or define the specific relationships between the input and output data points.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nEvaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities.

However, the precision score is reduced slightly due to the lack of clear definitions for adjacent connections between pixels and how this connectivity is determined in practice.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndescription:\ninput: In all three input sequences, there are multiple objects consisting of at least one pixel colored between 1 and 9 (foreground pixels). These objects may consist of single pixels or connected groups of pixels.\noutput: In all three output sequences, each object has been modified according to some rule resulting in either unchanged objects or combinations of original objects. This leads to new objects being formed having sizes larger than those present in the respective input sequences.\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects merge when two or more non-overlapping objects exist next to each other horizontally.\noverall pattern: When there are two or more non-overlapping objects existing next to each other horizontally in the input, these objects will be merged into a single object where the starting index remains the same but the ending index is updated to reflect the combined size.\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Here is the JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions accurately describe the input by specifying the presence and arrangement of foreground objects.
