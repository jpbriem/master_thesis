These objects undergo various transformations including moving, copying, and recoloring without changing their relative positions or sizes within the larger context of the image. In some cases, new 'copied' colors appear that weren't present in the initial palette.\noutput: Across all examples, we observe consistencies in how similarly colored pixels are grouped together and treated as distinct units or objects. These objects experience various modifications, such as relocation, duplication, and recoloring, without altering their internal structures or relative placements within the overall image. It's worth noting that sometimes entirely new hues (not previously existing in the original set) emerge post-transformation.\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\n\"Example_1\": {\n    \"input_analysis\": \"The input description accurately reflects the example, as it involves treating groups of similar colored pixels as distinct units.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

In the input, there are separate objects at positions 5-7, 12-16, 23-27, and 30-32. Similarly, in the output, there are distinct objects at positions 5-7, 12-16, 23-25, and 30-32.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the identified objects in pairs, checking if they share the same starting index.\n- In this test case, the objects at positions 23-25 and 30-32 do share the same starting index in the input. However, we need to check whether the algorithm handles multiple instances of consecutive objects sharing the same starting indices.\n\nStep 3: If two consecutive objects share the same starting index, identify their common color value.\n- For the input sequence, the color value of the first pair is 1, and the second pair has a color value of 1.\n\nStep 4: Replace the second object in the pair with a new object having a color value equal to the original color + 5.\n- According to Step 4, the second object in both pairs should be replaced with 6.\n\nComparing the expected output based on Steps 1-4 with the Test Output reveals discrepancies:\n- There should be an object with a value of 6 in place of positions 26-27 instead of the single object with a value of 6 at positions 23-25.\n\nStep 5: Output the modified sequence.\n- Since there were errors in previous steps, the final output is incorrect.\n\nTest Output Analysis: Considering the inconsistencies found during our examination, it appears that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input sequence. Several issues arise when handling multiple instances of consecutive objects sharing the same starting indices. Furthermore, the replacement rules seem to apply to all pairs regardless of their respective positions. A more sophisticated approach would help address the challenges related to multiple object occurrences.\n\nValue: Based on the analysis above, I would rate the test output a 3 out of 10 due to the presence of significant flaws in applying the transformation rules. Improvements can be made by considering edge cases involving multiple object pairs and refining the application of replacement rules to ensure consistency throughout the entire sequence.\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, we apply Step 1 and identify adjacent pixels of the same color as objects in the input sequence:\n\n[0, (1), 0, 0, 0, (1, 2, 3, 4), (5), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, (6, 7, 8), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, (9), 1, 0, 1, (10), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNext, in Step 2, we iterate through the identified objects in pairs, checking if they share the same starting index:\n\n(1) - no pair\n(1, 2, 3, 4) - shared starting index, common color = 1\n(5) - no pair\n(6, 7, 8) - shared starting index, common color = 6\n(9) - no pair\n(10) - no pair\n\nIn Step 3, we identify the common color value for those pairs with shared starting indices:\n\nColor 1\nColor 6\n\nFinally, in Step 4, we replace the second object in the pair with a new object having a color value equal to the original color + 5:\n\n[0, (1), 0, 0, 0, (6), (11), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, (16), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, (11), 1, 0, 1, (16), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, comparing this modified sequence with the test output sequence, we can see that the first and last objects in the output sequence match our expectations. However, there is an extra object with a value of 11 appearing after the sixth object, and another one appearing after the eleventh object. This indicates that something went wrong during the application of the transformation steps.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would rate the test output as **3 out of 10**, since only a part of the sequence matches the expected output. There seem to be issues with applying the specified transformation rules, particularly regarding replacing the second object in the pair with the correct color value (+5).\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
