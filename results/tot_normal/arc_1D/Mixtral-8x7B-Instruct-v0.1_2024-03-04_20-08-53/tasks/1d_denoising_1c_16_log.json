However, it's worth noting that the remaining cluster of 8s could potentially also be treated as background, depending on how strictly we interpret 'adjacent'.\",\n        \"value\": \"7\"\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"input_analysis\": \"Similar to Example 2, there are multiple distinct objects of the same color here. The main difference is that these objects are smaller and more spread out.\",\n        \"output_analysis\": \"As expected, only the initial group of 8s remains unchanged, while everything else has been converted to 0. Again, depending on the interpretation of adjacency, one might argue whether the final group of 8s should technically be considered part of the background or not.\",\n        \"value\": \"7\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAcross all three examples, both the input and output descriptions seem to fit reasonably well, but there are certain ambiguities related to what exactly constitutes an 'object', especially when considering clusters of identical colors separated by only one or two background pixels. These issues prevent me from giving higher ratings.\n------\n Here is the output in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"input_analysis\": \"For the first example, the input consists of a single object of color 7 that spans the entire length of the sequence except for three consecutive sections of zeros. This matches the provided description since there is indeed one object consisting of adjacent pixels of the same color (7) separated by background color (0).\",\n        \"output_analysis\": \"However, the output description does not provide any information about what properties the output should have. In this case, it seems like the function replaces all consecutive runs of zeros in the input with zeros in the output, but without knowing this beforehand, it would be impossible to determine the correct output based on the description alone.\",\n        \"value\": \"5\"\n    },\n    \"Example_2\": {\n        \"input_analysis\": \"Similarly to Example 1, the input consists of two objects of color 8 that span multiple sections of the sequence, separated by either background color (0) or another object. Again, this matches the general shape of the input described above.\",\n        \"output_analysis\": \"In this case, the output removes the leading and trailing sections of 8's, such that the non-zero section of the array begins and ends with an 8. However, this behavior is not specified anywhere in the description, making it difficult to apply to new inputs.\",\n        \"value\": \"5\"\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"input_analysis\": \"This input consists of three objects, alternating between 8's and 0's. While the previous inputs each had at least one continuous run of the foreground color (7 or 8), this input has multiple discrete runs of 8's. Despite this difference, the input still follows the general shape outlined above.\",\n        \"output_analysis\": \"As with Examples 1 and 2, the output collapses all consecutive runs of zeros into a single run at the beginning of the sequence. However, unlike those examples, the final non-zero element in the output is now a 0 rather than an 8, potentially indicating some inconsistency in how the function handles inputs with multiple disconnected regions.\",\n        \"value\": \"5\"\n    }\n}\n```\nOverall, while the input descriptions do capture some aspects of the underlying structure present in these examples, the output descriptions leave much to be desired. Without more concrete guidance about how to transform the input arrays into outputs, it would be difficult to generate accurate outputs for arbitrary inputs. Based on these examples, I would rate the descriptions a 5 out of 10."

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

            "prompt_log": "#############################\nFirst node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

If an object (a sequence of identical numbers) is followed by another object of the same number or background (0), then all noise pixels (0s) between them should be removed. 2.

This applies to cases where an object is at the beginning or end of the sequence and is followed or preceded by background (0). By applying these transformation steps, we can generalize this pattern and apply it to any input sequence that follows this rule.\n------\n Based on the provided example input-output pairs and the absence of specific instructions, it appears that the task involves modifying the input sequence so that each connected component of non-zero pixels becomes a single contiguous segment at the beginning of the sequence, followed by zero padding. I will provide general transformation steps assuming this pattern. Here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"Input sequences consist of one or more connected components of non-zero pixels separated by zero padding.\",\n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify connected components of non-zero pixels in the input sequence.\",\n    \"Step 2: Determine the index range (start_index and end_index) for each connected component.\",\n    \"Step 3: Sort the identified connected components based on their first occurrence in the sequence (i.e., start_index).\",\n    \"Step 4: Concatenate the sorted connected components into a new sequence.\",\n    \"Step 5: Add zero padding at the end of the new sequence until it reaches the length of the original input sequence.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the algorithm would involve identifying connected components, determining their ranges, sorting them based on their start indices, concatenating the sorted components, and finally adding zero padding at the end if necessary.\n------\n Based on the provided examples and the absence of specific description or overall pattern, I will make some assumptions about the transformation rules. Here is the general transformation step that can be applied to these examples:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"For each example, if there exists at least one object (a sequence of non-zero adjacent integers) with noise pixels (zeros) before it, then replace those noise pixels with the first integer value of the object.\",\n  \n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Iterate through the input sequence.\",\n      \"action\": \"Loop over the input sequence and find the starting index of each object.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check for preceding zeros.\",\n      \"action\": \"If there are any zeros before the current object's start index, continue; otherwise proceed to the next iteration.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Replace preceding zeros.\",\n      \"action\": \"Replace the found zeros with the first integer value of the current object until reaching the object's start index.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: This solution assumes that a single object starts immediately after the preceding zeros when present.#############################\nNext node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Examples 2 and 3 show agreement since there was no single colored element present at the end of the sequences.\n------\n Based on the provided information, it is impossible to evaluate the correctness of the transformation steps since none were given. In order to perform an accurate evaluation, I would need to know what the proposed transformation steps are. However, I can provide some general observations about the input and output sequences for each example.\n\nFor all examples, the output sequence has a block of zeros replacing the original non-zero color blocks in the input sequence. It seems like the longest block of zeros in the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence. Additionally, there is at least one color block that remains unchanged in the output sequence for each example. Here's the analysis for each example:\n\nExample_1:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the input sequence contains only 7s, except for three groups of zeros. These three groups of zeros in the input sequence are preserved in the output sequence without any modification. All other 7s in the input sequence are replaced by zeros.\nvalue: 7\n\nExample_2:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Regarding the second example, the input sequence contains two long blocks of 8s separated by a group of zeros.

Unlike the previous examples, this time, the leftmost block of 8s disappears completely in the output sequence, whereas the rightmost block of 8s and the middle group of zeros remain intact.\nvalue: 6\n\nWithout knowing the actual transformation steps, I cannot confirm whether these observed patterns result from the application of those steps.

The input sequence contains one object with color 7, ranging from index 0 to 17 and another object with color 7, ranging from index 31 to 32.

There are no noise pixels between any two adjacent objects of the same color in this example as there are no instances where two 7s appear next to each other. Hence, step 2 does not apply here.\n3. The first object starts at index 0, and there is no background (0) before it. Therefore, step 3 does not apply here.\n4. The last object ends at index 32, and there is no background (0) after it. Thus, step 4 does not apply here.\n\nFinal verdict: Although the transformation steps generally make sense, they do not lead to any changes in the input sequence due to the specific arrangement of numbers in Example\\_1. The transformation steps may need further clarification or adjustment depending on the exact rules governing what constitutes \"noise pixels.\"\n\nRating: **6** out of 10\n\nExample\\_2:\n\n1. The input sequence has one object with color 8, starting from index 4 and ending at index 25. This matches the output sequence's single object.\n2. Noise pixels exist between indices 9 and 15; however, removing these would result in an incorrect output sequence since those indices contain non-zero elements. Hence, applying step 2 would produce incorrect results.\n3. Step 3 applies as there is a background (0) before the first object. Removing all noise pixels between them would mean eliminating everything up to index 3. However, this action would also eliminate some non-zero elements, leading to an erroneous output sequence.\n4. Step 4 does not apply because there is no background (0) before the last object.\n\nFinal verdict: Some steps seem misguided or could potentially yield incorrect outputs when applied strictly as described. Further clarifications might help refine the process so that it works consistently across various scenarios.\n\nRating: **3** out of 10\n\nOverall, while the transformation steps offer insightful guidance on handling objects and noises in the sequences, they lack precision in implementation. Specifically, step 2 appears problematic as it can lead to incorrect removal of non-zero elements. Moreover, certain conditions like step 3 can cause unintended side effects if implemented literally.\n\nAverage Rating: (**4.5**) out of 10\n------\n Here is the JSON formatted output based on my analysis:\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"For the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify and remove noise pixels between consecutive identical objects in the input sequence.

Improvement is required to ensure the integrity of distinct objects during the conversion process.\n------\n Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:\n\nExample\\_1:\n\n* Transformation analysis: The transformation steps correctly identify the starting index of the single object present in the input sequence (consisting solely of 7s). However, since there are no preceding zeros, step 3 is not executed and thus does not replace them with the first integer value of the object. Therefore, while the resulting sequence satisfies the desired output, it does not comply strictly with the provided transformation steps.\n* Transformation rating: 7/10. The transformation steps are mostly correct, but one crucial step is not applied due to the specific nature of this particular example.\n\nExample\\_2:\n\n* Transformation analysis: In this case, the transformation steps perform flawlessly. They accurately locate the starting indices of the two non-zero objects in the input sequence, then eliminate the preceding zeros by replacing them with the first integer value of each respective object. This results in a sequence identical to the expected output.\n* Transformation rating: 10/10. The transformation steps fit this scenario perfectly, being entirely applicable and accurate.\n\nExample\\_3:\n\n* Transformation analysis: Similar to Example\\_2, the transformation steps work effectively here. Initially, the steps detect the starting indices of both non-zero objects in the input sequence, followed by removing the preceding zeros for each object. Ultimately, this produces a resultant sequence that matches the desired output.\n* Transformation rating: 10/10. The transformation steps function ideally for this situation, demonstrating complete accuracy and applicability.\n\nIn conclusion, the transformation steps appear valid for most cases, although they may not necessarily apply to every scenario involving distinct patterns.

There are no other objects present in this input.\n\nTransformation:\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence and their positions. In our test case, we have identified two objects with color 7 at the mentioned indices above.\n2. For each object, check if it is followed by another object of the same number or background (0). If yes, remove all noise pixels between them. Applying this step to both objects, no noise removal is needed after the first object since there are consecutive 0s before the next object. However, for the second object, we need to remove the noise pixels between indices 7 and 12 because they separate the two objects and aren't part of either object.\n3. Check if the first object in the sequence is followed by background (0). If yes, remove all noise pixels between them. Since there is a separation between the beginning of the sequence and the first object, we must remove noise pixels between indices 0 and 1 (inclusive), where the first object starts.\n4. Check if the last object in the sequence is preceded by background (0). If yes, remove all noise pixels between them. Here, we don't need to apply any changes since the last object ends at the correct location without any noise pixels between it and the end of the sequence.\n\nTransformed objects:\nIn the output, the two objects will remain merged due to removing all the noise pixels separating them. They will still retain their original color (7) and sizes (6).

Then, I will apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence. Lastly, I will describe the expected transformed objects in the test output sequence and return the final output as a numpy array.\n\nGeneral Description:\nThe underlying pattern involves identifying connected components (objects) made up of identical adjacent pixels in the input sequence. This pattern consists of removing objects if they meet one of two conditions:\n1. If the object contains noise pixels (non-object pixels surrounded by object pixels).\n2. If there exists another object ahead of it with the same color and having more continuous non-zero pixels than the previous object.\nIn other words, after comparing objects with the same color, smaller objects get removed.\n\nTransformation process applied to the test input:\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence.\nThere are three objects in the input sequence:\n1. Object A: Color - 7; Start index: 2; End index: 9; Size: 8\n2. Object B: Color - 7; Start index: 16; End index: 16; Size: 1\n3. Object C: Color - 7; Start index: 19; End index: 25; Size: 7\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the removal conditions.\nSince there are no noise pixels in these objects, we proceed to compare them based on their sizes. Comparing the objects with the same color, we find:\n- Object A has a larger size compared to Object B and Object C. Hence, keep Object A.\n- Remove both Object B and Object C because a subsequent object with the same color has a greater size.\n\nStep 3: Apply the transformation to create the output sequence.\n\nTransformed Output Sequence:\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nInput Description:\nFor the test input, we had three objects in the input sequence. Two of the objects were removed due to being smaller than a subsequent object of the same color.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nIn the test output sequence, there is only one object remaining \u2013 Object A. Its properties remain unchanged throughout the transformation process.\n- Object A: Color - 7; Start index: 2; End index: 9; Size: 8\n\nOutput:\nReturning the transformed test output sequence as numpy array:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ntest_output = np.array([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first provide a description for the input, then explain the transformation process, followed by a description of the transformed objects, and finally, return the resulting output sequence as a numpy array. Here it goes:\n\n{'input\\_description': 'In the input sequence, we have two primary objects: object 1 consists of seven consecutive 7s at positions 2 through 8, and object 2 contains a single 7 at position 16.

Next, starting from the rightmost non-zero index, clear up to but not including the leftmost non-zero index in the remaining region (excluding the initial segment). This results in removing the noise pixels between and after the objects while preserving the original objects. Finally, replace all occurrences of the lowest color value among the objects (which is 7 in this case) with zeros.',\n\n'transformed\\_objects': 'After applying these transformations, both objects remain intact without any modifications since they do not meet the specified conditions.

We will determine whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into the test output sequence.\n\nFirst, let's look at the input sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, we compare this input with the provided output sequence:\n\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWe can now go through the transformation steps one by one:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence and their positions:\n   Input sequence contains two objects:\n    - Object_1: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] starting at index 2 and ending at index 11.\n    - Object_2: [7] starting at index 20 and ending at index 20.\n\n2. For each object, check if it is followed by another object of the same number or background (0):\n   - Object_1 is followed by [0, 0, 7], which is neither the same number nor background. This violates step 2.\n   - Object_2 is followed by [0, 0, 0]. These are background pixels, so no issue here.\n\n3. Check if the first object in the sequence is followed by background (0):\n   Object_1 starts at index 2, and before that there are two background zeros, so this checks out.\n\n4. Check if the last object in the sequence is preceded by background (0):\n   Object_2 ends at index 20, and after that, there are three background zeros, so this also checks out.\n\nGiven these observations, the transformation appears to not follow step 2 correctly since some noise pixels were left between Object\\_1 and the other occurrence of Object\\_7. Therefore, I cannot approve the test output sequence based on the given transformation specifications.\n\nAs a critic, my evaluation would be:\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 6}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence against the given transformation algorithm. We will follow each step of the algorithm and compare how it has been applied to the test input and test output sequences.\n\nStep 1: Identify objects in the input sequence and their positions.\n\nIn the test input sequence, we can identify three objects:\n\n* Object A: Color 7, starting index 2, ending index 10 (size: 9)\n* Object B: Color 7, starting index 16, ending index 16 (size: 1)\n* Object C: Color 7, starting index 24, ending index 24 (size: 1)\n\nWe observe that there is no object at index 13 as expected since the input sequence already had the correct groupings.\n\nNow let's look at the test output sequence:\n\n* Object A': Color 7, starting index 2, ending index 10 (size: 9)\n* Object B': Color 7, starting index 16, ending index 16 (size: 1)\n* Object C': Background (color 0), starting index 24, ending index 24 (size: 1)\n\nStep 2: For each object, check if it is followed by another object of the same number or background (0). If yes, remove all noise pixels between them.\n\nAccording to this step, neither the test input nor test output needs any changes.\n\nStep 3: Check if the first object in the sequence is followed by background (0). If yes, remove all noise pixels between them.\n\nNeither the test input nor test output requires any adjustments based on this rule.\n\nStep 4: Check if the last object in the sequence is preceded by background (0). If yes, remove all noise pixels between them.\n\nNo action is required for this step either.\n\nSince none of the rules were violated during the evaluation process, the transformation appears to be correct for the given test input and output sequences. However, upon closer inspection, there seems to be an issue when applying Step 1 in the test output. In the test output, the third object (Object C') is identified as background rather than being assigned the same object label as Object A'. It suggests that the test output might contain a misinterpretation regarding contiguous groups of identical numbers.\n\nAs a result, despite the lack of apparent issues related directly to the transformation rules, our confidence in the accuracy of the test output declines due to the incorrect identification of adjacent objects. Therefore, we cannot provide a high rating for the quality of the test output.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'While the test input sequence appears to have followed the given transformation rules correctly, there is an error in identifying adjacent objects in the test output sequence, leading us to believe that the interpretation might not be accurate.

Additionally, any leading or trailing zeros can also be removed. Here's how I arrived at this conclusion:\n\n1. In Example_1, we see that the two long runs of 7s in the input are replaced by a single 7 followed by many zeros in the output. This suggests removing consecutive runs while keeping the initial value.\n2. Similarly, in Examples_2 and _3, we observe that one long run of 8s remains untouched whereas shorter runs (before and after) are combined into longer ones. Again, the initial value of the kept run matches the original.\n3. There are no provided description, overall pattern, or transformation steps; however, based on the examples alone, it seems like these rules apply.\n\nNow let's check the test case using our derived rules:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAccording to the derived rules:\n\n* Run of 7s before the initial 0 and after the last 0 are both eliminated resulting in: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Remaining runs of 7s are reduced to their first appearances yielding: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince there is no provided output for the test case, I cannot compare it directly against the expected one. However, according to our interpretation of the problem, the result does not match the input sequence. Thus, either the input sequence isn't properly formatted, or something went wrong during the transformation process.\n\nGiven the information at hand, I would rate the test output quality as a 1 out of 10 due to the significant discrepancies compared to the derived rules.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

This is evident as the output always contains groups of consecutive identical numbers (excluding zeros) which were present as individual consecutive numbers in the input.\n* Zeros separating these groups remain unchanged, indicating they function as delimiters between groups.\n\nHowever, without any specific description, overall pattern, or detailed transformation steps, it's impossible to determine whether the provided test case has been processed correctly according to those rules. Therefore, I cannot provide a conclusive value for the test output. Instead, here is a suggested format for your response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Due to insufficient information regarding the transformation process, it is not feasible to accurately evaluate the correctness of the provided test output.\",\n    \"value\": null\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the given examples, it appears that the transformation involves modifying the input sequence so that any non-background color (i.e., not 0) is replaced with another value depending on whether there exists at least one other non-zero element adjacent to it. Specifically, when there is at least one adjacent non-zero element, the non-zero element remains unchanged; otherwise, it gets replaced by 0. Here's the evaluation of the provided test case according to this rule:\n\nTest Input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nTransformed Test Output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince every non-zero element has at least one adjacent non-zero element except the last two instances of 7 in the test input sequence, they must be changed to 0 based on the described transformation. However, these elements were left unchanged in the given output. Thus, there seems to be an issue during the application of the rules. Additionally, no specific description, overall pattern, or transformation steps were mentioned, making the verification more challenging. Nonetheless, using the information available from the examples, we can see that the given output does not adhere to the observed transformation rule. Therefore, I cannot provide a rating above 0 for this test output sequence.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the provided examples, the task appears to replace non-background color elements with 0 if they do not have any adjacent non-background color elements. In the test case, the two final occurrences of 7 should have been replaced with 0 based on this rule. Since the output does not follow the demonstrated rule, it is impossible to assign a high rating. A correct implementation would better adhere to the discovered pattern.', 'value': '0'}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Additionally, based on the examples, it seems that instances of the background color (0) are left unchanged by the transformation.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input sequence, we see that:\n\n* The first group of consecutive 7s is transformed correctly.\n* The second group of consecutive 7s is transformed correctly.\n* The single 7 following the second group of consecutive 7s is removed correctly.\n* The third group of consecutive 7s is transformed correctly.\n* The fourth group of consecutive 7s (which consists of a single 7) is removed correctly.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the transformation has been applied correctly to the test input sequence. However, it's worth noting that without access to the actual implementation of the transformation, there's always a possibility of edge cases or other issues that might cause incorrect behavior.\n\nOverall, I would rate the correctness of the test output as 10 out of 10, as it appears to match the expected behavior based on the provided examples.\n------\n Based on the given examples and transformation steps, it appears that the task is to identify continuous regions of certain colors in the input sequence and replace other colors within those regions with zeros. Here's how I would evaluate the provided test output sequence:\n\nFirst, we can observe that there are no longer any regions of the color 0 in the output sequence, so let's see if the other colors were processed correctly. Specifically, we want to check if all regions consisting solely of the color 7 were shifted towards the beginning of the sequence while replacing non-7 colors within these regions with zeros.\n\nLooking at the test input sequence, we can identify three such regions: one starting at index 2 (position 3), another starting at index 14 (position 15), and a final region starting at index 24 (position 25). We can compare the sizes and positions of these regions in the input and output sequences.\n\n* Original Region 1: start=2, end=13, size=12\n\t+ Transformed Region 1: start=2, end=8, size=7\n* Original Region 2: start=14, end=23, size=10\n\t+ Transformed Region 2: start=9, end=16, size=8\n* Original Region 3: start=24, end=31, size=8\n\t+ Transformed Region 3: start=17, end=24, size=8\n\nWe can see that the sizes of the regions match exactly after the transformation, but their positions do not. Moreover, we notice that the first two regions are now overlapping in the output sequence since they were combined during the shift toward the beginning. This violates the expected behavior since adjacent regions should maintain their separation in the output sequence. Thus, the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input sequence.\n\nTherefore, my evaluation is as follows:\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm carefully, paying close attention to the preservation of adjacent regions. In this case, the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input sequence due to incorrect shifting of regions resulting in overlaps.\",\n    \"value\": 2\n}\n```\nThis rating reflects significant errors in the transformation process based on the observed issues."
