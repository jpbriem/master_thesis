The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': \"based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation\"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change?

If there is more than one object, repeat steps 2 and 3 for subsequent objects.\n5.

            "prompt_log": "#############################\nFirst node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\n\noverall pattern: None\n\ntransformation steps: None\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the provided information, I will first try to understand the underlying pattern by examining the examples given. It seems that in each of these cases, there are long consecutive runs of identical numbers (representing a single object) followed by many zeros (background). In the transformed output, if the non-zero object is at the beginning of the input sequence, it remains unchanged but shifted to the right side of the sequence (as close to the end as possible while still being contiguous), surrounded by zeros. If the non-zero object is already near the end of the input sequence, it stays mostly unchanged except that any trailing zeros in the input become part of the non-zero object in the output.\n\nNow let's break down the problem and tackle the required components step-by-step.\n\ninput\\_description:\nIn the given test input, we have a single object occupying the initial seven positions of the sequence, where each element has a value of 1, i.e., the object has a color value of 1, starts at index 0, ends at index 6, and consists of 7 elements.\n\ntransformation:\nWe examine the conditions applied to the transformation pattern provided. Since our input sequence has a non-zero object at the very beginning, it satisfies the first condition. We then shift this object towards the end while maintaining its integrity. During the shifting process, we encounter zeros, which get incorporated into the non-zero object due to the second condition. Finally, after completing the shifts, we place the object as far to the right as possible without exceeding the boundaries of the sequence.\n\ntransformed\\_objects:\nOur input's non-zero object with color value 1 now appears at the end of the sequence as a result of the transformation.\n\noutput:\nTo generate the final output, we simply return the modified sequence as a NumPy array:\n```scss\narray([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])\n```\nCombine everything together in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"There is one object with color 1 present in the input sequence starting from index 0, ending at index 6, and having a total of 7 elements.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"The non-zero object was found at the beginning of the input sequence and got moved toward the right side of the sequence while incorporating all encountered zeros in the way before reaching its final position at the last index.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"The object retains its original properties - color (1), position (start_index = 7, end_index = 14), and size (8).\",\n    \"output\": np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, here is the JSON response for the test case:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"The input sequence contains one object of color 1, which starts at index 0, ends at index 7, and has a size of 8.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"First, we need to find the first group of non-zero elements since the overall pattern involves moving it to the beginning.

Identify the connected component(s) of non-zero elements.\n2. If there exists at least one non-zero element to the left of the identified connected component(s):\na. Find the last index containing zeros before the connected component(s).\nb. Shift the connected component(s) from step 1 to that specific index found in step 2a.\n3. Else if there are no non-zero elements to the left of the identified connected component(s):\na. Keep the connected component(s) at the beginning of the sequence.\n\nApplying these insights to the test case, we get:\n\nInput description: A single connected component of identical numbers (1) located at the beginning of the sequence with a length of 8.\n\nTransformation:\n\n1. Identified connected component contains numbers 1.\n2. There exists at least one non-zero element to the left of the connected component (the entire component qualifies).\n   * Found the last index containing zeros before the connected component, which is the final index of the sequence (14).\n3.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence.

Here we go:\n\nInput description: Regarding the test input, there is one object with color 1, having a size of 7 (start\\_index: 0, end\\_index: 6), followed by another object starting at index 7 but it does not have any values set.\n\nTransformation: Analyzing the provided examples, I can see a common pattern emerging. When there is a single continuous block of foreground color, and if the very last element(s) do not maintain this background color property, they are moved to the beginning of the sequence until they meet another non-background color. Applying this rule to our test case results in moving the three trailing '1's before the '0' at index 7:\n\nTransformed objects: In the transformed sequence, there is still a single object of color 1, but now its size is 10 (start\\_index: 0, end\\_index: 10).\n\nOutput: To represent the output as a numpy array, I perform the required operations and obtain the following result:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntest_output = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n\nNow filling out the JSON response:\n{'input\\_description': 'Single object of color 1 with initial size 7, ending just before the background color section.',\n'transformation': 'Moved final consecutive occurrences of color 1 found before the background region to create a consistent background area after the object.',\n'transformed\\_objects': 'A single object of color 1 spanning the whole length of the sequence up to the blank background space.',\n'output': `test_output`}\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first outline the general pattern that can be observed from the examples. Then, I will proceed to analyze the test case using this pattern and provide a detailed transformation process. Finally, I will provide the required JSON response.\n\nGeneral Pattern:\n\n* If there is a single connected component of non-background colors (i.e., no isolated individual pixels), shift it towards the beginning of the sequence while maintaining its internal order, filling the empty space at the end with background zeros.\n\nTest Case Transformation Analysis:\n\nFor the test case, we see that there is a connected component of 1s at the beginning. Following our identified pattern, we need to maintain their order and shift them towards the beginning. We perform these operations step by step as follows:\n\n1. Identify the connected component: Index range [0, 7] contains the connected component of 1s.\n2. Shift elements to the beginning:\n   - Swap index 0 and 7. New sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n   - Swap index 1 and 6. New sequence: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n   - Swap index 2 and 5. New sequence: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n   - Swap index 3 and 4. New sequence: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n3. Fill the remaining sequence with background zeros:\n   - Index range [8, 15] has become the empty section after shifting; fill it with background zeros.\n\nJSON Response:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In the input sequence, there is one object of color 1 extending from index 0 to index 7 with a size of 8.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Step 1: Identified the connected component of 1s from indices 0 to 7. Steps 2 & 3: Maintaining the order, shifted the components towards the start of the sequence and filled the now empty spaces at the end with background zeros.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"In the test output sequence, the object remains unchanged in terms of size (8) but moves to the beginning of the sequence starting at index 0.\",\n    \"output\": \"[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\"\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the information provided, I will first try to identify the underlying pattern by analyzing the given examples. After understanding the pattern, I will proceed with performing the transformation on the test case.\n\nFrom the examples, it can be observed that the transformation moves the consecutive group of non-zero pixels to the beginning of the sequence if they appear before any zeros. If there are no non-zero pixels at the beginning (preceded by any number of zeros), then the first occurrence of the group of non-zero pixels remains unchanged.\n\nGiven this analysis, let us perform the transformation on the test case, applying the identified pattern:\n\nInput description: In the test input, we have one object consisting of 8 consecutive pixels with color 1 at positions from 0 to 7, followed by a series of zeros.\n\nTransformation: Move the object containing color 1 to the beginning of the sequence since it appears before any zeros.\n\nTransformed objects: In the test output, we would have the object with color 1, still comprised of 8 consecutive pixels but now located at the beginning of the sequence (positions 0 to 7).\n\nOutput: By moving the object to the beginning, our test output becomes:\n\nnumpy.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first identify the patterns present in the examples and then apply them to the test case to generate the output. Here are my observations:\n\nInput description: In this specific input sequence, we can observe an object made up of consecutive 1's at the beginning of the sequence followed by a section of background (0's). There is no overlapping, alignment, or other complex relationships between the object and noise pixels since they are clearly separated.\n\nTransformation pattern: From the examples, it seems that if there exists a single contiguous non-zero valued object at one end of the sequence, the entire object moves to the opposite end of the sequence while retaining its original shape. This movement appears independent of any conditions related to object properties, arithmetic operations on objects, or noise pixels. Since the order of elements is relevant here, we could consider this as a shift operation applied to the object.\n\nTransformed objects: Given the applied transformation, the input object made of 1's would appear in reverse order at the opposite end of the sequence in the output, i.e., after padding with zeros at the end to retain dimensions.\n\nNow let me provide the response according to the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In the test input, there is an object consisting of seven consecutive 1's at the beginning of the sequence.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"According to the observed pattern, the object containing 1's needs to be moved to the opposite end of the sequence regardless of any conditions.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"As a result, the object made of 1's will be located at the opposite end of the sequence in reverse order, maintaining its size.\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the output is returned as a string enclosed in square brackets, representing a NumPy array.

If there is a single object (sequence of consecutive identical numbers) at either end of the input sequence, move it to the opposite side while preserving its order. This operation alternates the side of isolated objects after each application until no more alternations can occur.\n2. Otherwise, do nothing.\n\nGiven Test Input Sequence Evaluation:\n\nConsidering the outlined pattern above, let's examine the given test input sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Here, multiple applications of the pattern lead to the following results:\n\nApplication 1:\nInput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nApplication 2:\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nOutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince the resulting output sequence after two iterations matches the initial input sequence, applying this pattern again would yield the same result. Therefore, the current interpretation of the pattern seems complete and self-contained based on the given examples.\n\nHowever, without a specific test output sequence to compare the result against, I am unable to provide a numeric evaluation regarding whether the transformation was applied correctly. Nonetheless, one could infer the intended output by carefully studying the pattern and applying it consistently.\n------\n Based on the given examples, it appears that the transformation involves shifting the starting index of each object to the right by one position while maintaining the relative order of objects in the input sequence. This behavior can be observed in Examples 1, 2, and 3 where the first object's starting index is shifted to the right by one position in the output sequence compared to the input sequence.

More specifically, when there is a single object at either end of the input sequence, it remains unchanged in the output sequence. However, when multiple objects appear consecutively at any end of the input sequence, they will merge towards the non-zero side until reaching the first (leftmost) zero index. In other words, the farthest left object from the zero boundary extends to include all consecutive objects towards the right.

If they do not match, then the transformation was likely not applied correctly.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would rate the test output as follows:\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence. Assuming that objects at the beginning of the sequence should also be shifted to the leftmost positions possible while maintaining their relative orders, the expected output should match the input sequence exactly. Without the actual test output, I cannot determine whether it adheres to this expectation. Therefore, additional information about the test output is required before providing a definitive rating.', 'value': 'N/A'}\n------\n Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the transformation being applied involves moving the starting index of the object (sequence of consecutive non-zero integers) to the first available zero-indexed location in the sequence without changing the order of the elements in the object. Moreover, the trailing zeros after the object(s) in the sequence remain unchanged. With this understanding, we will now evaluate the potential test output sequence.\n\nTest input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nGiven there is no provided test output for comparison, I cannot provide a direct evaluation of whether the transformation was applied correctly. However, applying the aforementioned pattern to the test input yields:\n\nTest output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTo rate the correctness of the given test output, let's compare it with our derived test output using a simple metric. Since I don't have access to the actual test output, I'll assume the role of the AI model responsible for generating the output. Given my understanding of the problem, here's how I would rate the output based on self-evaluation.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\n\noverall pattern: None\n\ntransformation steps: None\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Based on the provided information, let's first identify the underlying pattern and transformation steps before evaluating the test case.\n\nPattern: In all three examples, we can observe that when there is an object (a continuous sequence of the same non-zero color) at either end of the input, it moves to the beginning of the output. If both ends contain objects, then they retain their order in the output. Additionally, any consecutive zeros separating objects merge together.\n\nTransformation Steps:\n\n1. Shift leading objects to the front of the array.\n2. Merge consecutive background (0) indices.\n\nNow that we understand the pattern and transformation process, we can evaluate the test case:\n\nTest case:\nInput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nStep 1 - Shifting leading objects to the front:\nIn this step, the first seven elements match the expected result, i.e., [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Therefore, this part has been done correctly.\n\nStep 2 - Merging consecutive background (0) indices:\nSince the output contains consecutive zeros at the beginning instead of merging them, this step seems to have NOT been implemented properly. Instead, the last 8 zeros should replace the initial four zeros.\n\nTherefore, our evaluation is as follows:\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider Step 2 of the transformation algorithm; the consecutive background (0) indices were not merged correctly as shown in the expected output, where the initial four zeros should be replaced by the final eight zeros. As a result, the test input cannot be confirmed to have undergone a correct transformation into the proposed test output.', 'value': '3'}\n------\n Based on the analysis of the provided examples and the test case, it seems like the transformation applies some rules related to moving non-zero elements towards the beginning of the sequence while maintaining their relative order. Here's how I break down the problem:\n\n1. Identify consecutive groups of identical numbers (except zero) at the end of the sequence.\n2. Move them to the front of the sequence, preserving their relative positions within the group and the spacing of zeroes separating these groups.\n3. Shift any remaining leading zeros to the end of the sequence without changing their number.\n\nApplying this interpretation to the test case, it appears there is a discrepancy in the transformation result.\n\nThe correct output would look something like:\n\n`[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nGiven this observation, the rating will be **3** since not all steps were followed properly during the transformation."
