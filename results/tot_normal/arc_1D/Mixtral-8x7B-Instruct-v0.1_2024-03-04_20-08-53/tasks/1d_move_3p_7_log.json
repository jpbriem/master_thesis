            "prompt_log": "#############################\nFirst node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\n\noverall pattern: None\n\ntransformation steps: None\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the given information, I will first identify the underlying pattern and then apply it to the test case.\n\nPattern identification:\n1. If there is an object (non-zero pixels) at the beginning of the input sequence, move those pixels to the end of the output sequence while preserving their order.\n2. If there are noise pixels (zero pixels) at the beginning of the input sequence, append them to the end of the output sequence.\n\nTransformation steps:\n1. Identify objects and noise pixels in the input sequence\n2. Move objects found in step 1 to the end of the output sequence\n3. Append noise pixels found in step 1 to the end of the output sequence\n\nNow applying these steps to the test case:\n\n1. In the input sequence [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], we have an object consisting of three 4s and four noise pixels.\n2. We move the object to the end of the output sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n3. There are no noise pixels left in the input sequence, so nothing needs to be appended to the output sequence.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In the input sequence, there is one object with three consecutive pixels colored 4 starting at index 0.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Objects found at the beginning of the input sequence were moved to the end of the output sequence. Noise pixels found at the beginning of the input sequence were appended to the end of the output sequence.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"In the test output sequence, there is one object with three consecutive pixels colored 4 starting at index 4.\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\"\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided examples, it seems that the transformation involves moving objects (i.e., consecutive non-zero pixels) to the rightmost positions while maintaining their relative order. To provide the required information in JSON format, I will first analyze the transformation pattern and then apply it to the test case.\n\nHere is the requested JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In the input sequence, there is one object containing three red pixels (color 4) at positions 1 to 3.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"First, identify the leftmost position with a non-zero pixel (position 1). Then, iterate through this object's elements and swap them with the last encountered non-zero element in the sequence until reaching the end of the object. This moves the entire object to the rightmost positions in the sequence while preserving its internal ordering.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"After applying the transformation, there will be one object containing three red pixels (color 4) at positions 5 to 7.\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\"\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first identify the underlying transformation pattern, then apply it to the test case. Here are my answers:\n\nInput description:\nThe input sequence contains one object with color 4, having a size of 3, positioned at the beginning of the sequence (start\\_index: 0, end\\_index: 2).\n\nTransformation:\nSince there are no specific transformation steps or conditions given, I assume we need to follow the observed pattern in the examples. In this case, when an object of any color appears at the beginning of the input sequence, it should be moved to the end of the sequence while maintaining its original order of pixels. It can be expressed as:\n\n\"If an object exists at the beginning of the input sequence, move it to the end of the sequence.\"\n\nTransformed objects:\nIn the test output sequence, the object containing color 4 should appear at the end of the sequence, preserving its internal structure and size (size: 3, position: end\\_index: 6).\n\nOutput:\nBased on the specified transformation rule, here is the output numpy array for the provided test case:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first identify the underlying transformation pattern by observing the given examples. It seems that the pattern is shifting the largest object (sequence of consecutive non-zero numbers) to the rightmost side of the sequence while maintaining its order. Now, let's analyze the test case.\n\nTest case input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ninput\\_description: In this input sequence, there is one object of color 4 with a size of 3 starting at index 0.\n\ntransformation: First, we need to find the largest object, which is already identified as color 4 with a size of 3 at the beginning of the sequence. Next, we shift it to the rightmost side of the sequence while maintaining its order, i.e., moving three positions to the right. During this process, zeros take up the empty spaces created due to the movement of the object.\n\ntransformed\\_objects: After applying the transformation, the object will appear as a sequence of three consecutive 4s at the rightmost side of the sequence, starting at index 4.\n\nNow, I will implement the observed pattern using Python code and return the resulting test output sequence as a NumPy array.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef apply_transformation(input_seq):\n    # Find the largest object\n    obj_start = 0\n    obj_size = 0\n    for idx, val in enumerate(input_seq):\n        if val!= 0:\n            obj_size += 1\n        elif obj_size > 0:\n            obj_start = idx\n            obj_size = 0\n    \n    if obj_size == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"No object found\")\n\n    # Shift the largest object to the rightmost side\n    num_shifts = len(input_seq) - obj_start - obj_size\n    shifted_obj = np.zeros(len(input_seq), dtype=int)\n    shifted_obj[-num_shifts:] = input_seq[:obj_size]\n\n    # Insert non-object elements after the transformed object\n    shifted_obj[:-num_shifts] = input_seq[obj_size:-num_shifts]\n\n    return shifted_obj\n\ntest_input = np.array([4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0])\nresult = apply_transformation(test_input)\nprint({'input_description': 'input description text', 'transformation': 'transformation description text', 'transformed_objects': 'transformed objects description text', 'output': result})\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual response JSON content has been printed instead of being directly assigned to the `{'output':...}` field since variable interpolation is not supported in the requested format.#############################\nNext node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Since our transformation requires us to move objects to the rightmost side, we shall shift these elements to the rightmost part of the sequence.\n\nNow let's fill out the JSON format response:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In the input sequence, there is one object of color 4, consisting of three consecutive pixels starting at index 0.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Identified the single object in the input sequence, and according to the observed pattern, moved the object containing the consecutive pixels of color 4 to the rightmost side of the sequence.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"[{color: 4, start_index: 4, end_index: 6, size: 3}]\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\"\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first identify the underlying pattern and then apply it to the test case.\n\nInput description: In the test input, we have one object with color 4. This object has a size of 3 (start\\_index: 0, end\\_index: 2), occupying the beginning of the sequence.\n\nTransformation: The pattern involves moving objects to the rightmost side of the sequence while maintaining their relative order. Applying this rule to our test input:\n\n1. Identify the object(s): There is one object - color 4, starting at index 0 and ending at index 2 (size = 3).\n2. Move the object(s) to the right: Since there are no other objects, simply keeping them aligned at the rightmost part of the sequence would suffice.\n\nTransformed objects: After applying the transformation, the original object remains unchanged since it was already located at the rightmost part of the sequence. So, the object in the test output sequence has color 4, starts at index 0 with an end\\_index of 2, and retains a size of 3.\n\nOutput: As per the instructions, below is the output without quotes (' ') around the numpy array. Note that due to formatting restrictions, I am using single quotes here but please remove them when filling out your response.\n\nnumpy.array([4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n------\n Based on the information provided, I will first identify the patterns present in the given examples and then apply them to the test case.

In this case, we will remove the object containing three consecutive fours at the beginning of the sequence. This results in [0, 0, 0, 0]. Step 2: Insert the removed object at the very end of the sequence. So the output becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"There is one object (color: 4) in the output sequence placed at the very end, having a size of 3.\",\n    \"output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]\"\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first try to identify the underlying transformation pattern by analyzing the given input-output pairs. It seems that the objects (consecutive pixels of the same non-zero value) in the input sequences are being moved to the right side of the sequence while maintaining their relative order and keeping the original distances between them. Here is the filled out JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In the test input, there is one object consisting of three consecutive pixels with color 4 starting at index 0.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"For this transformation, we need to move the object to the right side of the sequence while preserving the relative positions and distances between the pixels.

To convert it to a numpy array, simply use `numpy.fromstring()`.

Identify the positions of the first non-background pixel (i.e., > 0) in both the input and output sequences. In our test case, these positions would be index 0 for the input and index 6 for the output.\n2. Move all non-background pixels from the input sequence towards the end of the output sequence, such that their relative order is preserved. Comparing the test input and output, we can see that the last four elements of the output match the initial four elements of the input.

This results in an expected length of 9. However, the actual length of the output sequence is 8, which means that some part of the transformation was not correctly applied. Specifically, there seems to be an issue with shifting the elements to the right by the length of the longest object. Additionally, the first element of the output sequence should remain unchanged since it's a background (0), but it was changed to 0 in the test output sequence.

We will evaluate the given test input sequence based on this interpretation of the transformation.\n\nGiven the input=[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], we expect the output to push the consecutive fours (colored pixels) towards the rightmost side of the sequence. Let's apply the described rules step by step:\n\n1. Compare the first two elements of the input sequence - both are equal to 4. Nothing changes at this point because they belong together as part of object_1.\n2. Move on to the third element of the input sequence, still a 4. Add it to our temporary object_1 since it is contiguous with previous elements of the same value.\n3. Reach the fourth element, now a 0. Since there are still consecutive colored pixels, simply move forward without changing anything.\n4. Fifth element is another 0, so again do nothing and proceed further.\n5. Sixth element is yet another 0, which has us continue advancing through the sequence.\n6. Finally reach the seventh element, another 0.

We can evaluate the given test input-output pair by applying this transformation manually and comparing the result to the provided output. Here are the detailed transformation steps based on our observation from examples:\n\n1. Identify the first non-zero index `start` and last non-zero index `end` in the input sequence. In our case, `start = 0`, and `end = 2`.\n2. Create two sublists from the original input sequence - one containing elements before the `start` index and another after the `end` index: `slice_before = []`, and `slice_after = input[end + 1:]` in our case.\n3. Combine all three parts together, forming the final output: `output = slice_before + [0] * (end - start + 1) + slice_after`. This results in output=[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].\n\nGiven the expected output is not provided, we cannot compare our output with the test output directly.

In such a case, the test output matches the expected result, and the proposed transformation method works well.\n\nWith that said, here's my response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Considering that the task consists of moving objects (non-zero elements) in the input sequence towards the rightmost positions while preserving their relative order, the given test_output appears to apply the algorithm successfully.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n```\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

This is done by shifting the leading zeros to the left side of the object until there are no more zeros before it. We can evaluate this hypothesis against the provided test case.\n\nHypothesis: Shift objects consisting of consecutive non-zero pixels to the rightmost part of the sequence.\n\nTest Input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nTransformation Steps:\n1. Identify the first object (consecutive non-zero pixels): [4, 4, 4]. Its start index is 0, and its end index is 2.\n2. Starting from the beginning of the sequence, shift the leading zeros to the left of the identified object:\n   - Iteration 1: Move one zero from index 3 to index 0. New sequence: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n   - Iteration 2: Move another zero from index 4 to index 1. New sequence: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]\n   - Iteration 3: Move another zero from index 5 to index 2. New sequence: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nAfter applying the transformation based on our hypothesis, we expect an output like the following:\nExpected Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nHowever, the actual test output does not seem to exist in the problem statement, nor has it been provided. Therefore, I cannot perform a direct comparison to determine whether the transformation was applied correctly. Nevertheless, considering the consistency in the given examples, my assessment suggests that the expected output would align with the described transformation pattern. If the provided Test Case's expected output conforms to the hypothesized pattern, I would rate the test output highly around 9 out of 10. A perfect score might be reserved if there were additional confirmation regarding the accuracy of the transformation implementation.\n------\n Based on the given examples, it appears that the transformation involves moving all consecutive non-background pixels (i.e., pixels with color value between 1 and 9) to the rightmost part of the sequence while preserving their relative order. Here's how I would evaluate the test output sequence based on this observation:\n\n1. Transform the test input sequence [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0] using the observed pattern: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].\n2. Compare the transformed test input sequence with the provided output sequence [None]. Since there is no specified expected output, I cannot compare the two sequences directly. However, based on the overall pattern observed in the examples, we can infer that the correct output sequence should be [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].\n\nTherefore, my analysis suggests that the provided output sequence does not match the expected output based on the observed transformation pattern.
