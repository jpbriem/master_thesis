However, since there are no objects at the end of the input, the second part of the condition isn't demonstrated.\",\n\"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Analyzing the overall pattern for Example_1, we observe that shifting the first object to the end results in the correct output. Therefore, the overall pattern seems to be accurate for this particular example.\",\n\"precision_analysis\": \"Although the overall pattern works for the provided example, it lacks precision.

In general, there aren't any specific rules or patterns given except the input-output pairs themselves. I will assume that the goal is to move consecutive blocks of non-zero elements towards the beginning of the sequence while preserving their order, filling zeros at the end according to the block sizes. Based on this assumption, let us evaluate the steps using the examples.\n\nHere are the correct transformation steps:\n\n1. Find the index `first_non_zero` pointing to the first non-zero element in the current segment (initially set to the very first index).\n2. Starting at `first_non_zero`, find the next zero-index, denoted by `next_zero`. If no such zero exists, stop processing since the entire sequence has been covered.\n3. Swap the subarray starting at `first_non_zero` and ending just before `next_zero` (inclusive) with the range from 0 up till `next_zero`. This moves the non-zero block to the beginning of the array.\n4. Set `first_non_zero = next_zero`. Go back to step 2 until reaching the last non-zero element in the sequence.\n\nLet's take Example_1 and see how this would work:\n\nInput:\n\n```css\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nAfter step 1, `first_non_zero` points to the leftmost 2:\n\n```css\n[0|, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nAfter step 2, we find `next_zero` (marked by |):\n\n```css\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0|, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nAfter step 3, swap them:\n\n```css\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nSetting `first_non_zero = next_zero`, go to step 2 again. After completing these steps, you get the desired output:\n\nOutput:\n\n```css\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n```\n\nHowever, the given transformation steps don't mention moving or swapping any elements like our solution does. Therefore, I rate the given steps poorly as they cannot generate the desired transformations for the given examples.\n------\n Here are the transformation steps provided to me:\n\nTransformation Steps:\n\n1. Identify the longest object (i.e., consecutive group of non-zero pixels) in the input sequence. Let's call its length L.\n2. Shift the identified longest object to the beginning of the sequence, overwriting any zeros present there. Keep track of the number of zeros overwritten (Z).\n3. Insert Z zeros at the end of the sequence.\n\nNow let's evaluate these steps for each example:\n\nExample\\_1:\nInput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation steps:\n\n1. Longest object has length L = 6.\n2. After shifting, we get: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We overwrote Z = 2 zeros.\n3. Adding Z = 2 zeros at the end, results in the desired output.\n\nAnalysis for Example\\_1: The transformation steps work perfectly fine for this example, so I will rate them 10 out of 10.\n\nExample\\_2:\nInput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation steps:\n\n1. Longest object has length L = 7.\n2. After shifting, we get: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. However, no zeros were overwritten since the entire input was filled with non-zeros.\n3. Therefore adding zeros is meaningless here, because the input itself matches the expected output without applying any transformation. This inconsistency raises concerns about using these steps universally.\n\nAnalysis for Example\\_2: Due to the issue mentioned above, I cannot confidently say whether these transformation steps would always apply correctly. Thus, my rating would be lower than 10, but it remains unclear how well they generalize for other cases.\n\nExample\\_3:\nInput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation steps:\n\n1. Longest object has length L = 4.\n2. Since L < 5, we won't apply any shift operation according to step 2. Applying the steps literally does not provide us with the correct answer.\n\nAnalysis for Example\\_3: Ignoring the fact that step 2 wasn't applied due to L being smaller than expected, the final result after inserting zeros at the end still doesn't match the target output. Hence, the rating would be far below 10 considering this counterexample alone.\n\nSummary: Although the transformation steps seem reasonable initially, their applicability across various scenarios appears questionable. My evaluation based on the three examples provided is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    },\n    \"Example_2\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, while the transformation steps appear to yield the correct result, they don't actually perform any meaningful operations since the input already matches the expected output.\",\n        \"value\": 5\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, the transformation steps fail to produce the correct output, raising doubts about their generalizability.\",\n        \"value\": 3\n    }\n}\n```\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Find the ending index of each object in the input sequence (i.e., where a non-zero number ends). Let's call this set of indices `end_indices`.\n3. Create a new empty output sequence.\n4.

However, there are some edge cases we haven't considered yet, such as when two objects of different colors are adjacent or when multiple instances of the same object appear throughout the sequence. But based on the information provided, I cannot say whether these cases will actually occur in practice. Therefore, I would rate the transformation steps as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  }\n}\n```\n------\n Here are the detailed transformation steps provided:\n\n1. Identify continuous non-zero regions in the input sequence.\n2. Shift these identified regions towards the beginning of the sequence while preserving their relative order.\n3. Pad zeros at the end of the sequence to maintain its length.\n\nNow let's evaluate the transformation steps for each example and provide a rating based on their correctness.\n\nExample\\_1:\n---------------------\ntransformation\\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify the continuous non-zero region ([2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) and shift it towards the beginning ([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]). However, there seems to be no padding added at the end of the sequence.\nvalue: 7\n\nExample\\_2:\n---------------------\ntransformation\\_analysis: Similar to Example\\_1, the transformation steps accurately identify the continuous non-zero region ([4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]) and shift it towards the beginning ([0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]). Again, there is no mention of adding padding at the end of the sequence.\nvalue: 7\n\nExample\\_3:\n---------------------\ntransformation\\_analysis: In this case, the transformation steps work well in identifying the continuous non-zero region ([8, 8, 8, 8]) and shifting it towards the beginning ([0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]). Padding is unnecessary here since the output has the same length as the input.\nvalue: 10\n\nIt appears that the transformation steps generally capture the essence of moving continuous non-zero regions towards the beginning of the sequence. But, the padding step needs improvement, especially when dealing with cases where the shifted region does not occupy the entire length of the input. Based on the evaluation above, I would recommend a global rating of **7** out of 10 for the given transformation steps.#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change their position according to their initial placement in the input sequence. When an object is at the beginning or end of the input sequence, it stays at the beginning or end of the output sequence, respectively. If an object is surrounded by noise (zeros) on both sides, then it moves towards the center of the sequence, dividing the noise equally around itself.\noverall pattern: To transform an input into its output, find each object in the input sequence and check its position relative to the surrounding noise pixels. Move the object accordingly to satisfy the conditions mentioned above while preserving its original color and size. This results in the desired output where objects maintain their color and size but change position based on their initial placement in the input.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: None\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Here are the transformation steps that I came up with after analyzing the problem description, overall pattern, and input-output pairs provided:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output array with the same length as the input array.\n2. Iterate through the input array and identify the starting index of each connected component (object) using flood fill or another appropriate method.\n3. For each object, calculate its new ending index in the output array based on the following rules:\n\t* If the object is at the beginning or end of the input array, leave it at the beginning or end of the output array, respectively.\n\t* Otherwise, divide the number of zeros on either side of the object by two and shift the object towards the center accordingly. Specifically, set the new ending index to be equal to the old starting index plus half the number of zeros on the left and half the number of zeros on the right, rounded down.\n4. Copy the object from the input array to the output array at its new location calculated in step 3.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all objects have been processed and copied to the output array.\n6. Return the output array.\n\nNow let's evaluate how well these transformation steps match the given examples.\n\n**Example\\_1:**\n\n* Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nTransforming this input sequence according to the steps described above would result in the correct output sequence. We can see that there are no objects at the beginning or end of the input array, so we need to move them towards the center. Dividing the zeros evenly between the sides gives us the correct positions for each object, resulting in the expected output.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n**Example\\_2:**\n\n* Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nSimilarly, this input sequence can be transformed correctly using the given steps. Since there is an object at the beginning of the input array, we need to keep it at the beginning of the output array. All other objects must be moved towards the center, again divided evenly between the sides. Following these steps yields the correct output sequence.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n**Example\\_3:**\n\n* Input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis example also matches the given transformation steps. Only one object appears in this sequence, at the beginning of the input array. Therefore, it needs to stay at the beginning of the output array, which is exactly what happens when we follow the steps.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nOverall, I believe the given transformation steps accurately reflect the required processing for these examples. Each of the three examples was processed correctly according to those steps, leading me to rate the entire process as 10/10.\n------\n Based on the information provided, here's how we can evaluate the transformation steps:\n\nFirst, let's define the transformation steps:\n\n1. Identify each connected component (object) in the input sequence and determine its color, start index, and end index.\n2. Check the position of each object relative to the surrounding noise pixels.\n3. Move each object accordingly while preserving its original color and size to satisfy the conditions outlined in the overall pattern.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to each example:\n\nExample\\_1:\n\n* Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation steps to Example\\_1:\n\n1. There are two connected components (objects) in the input sequence: one with color 2 starting at index 1 and ending at index 5.\n2. The leftmost object (with color 2) has noise pixels to its left and right. Therefore, moving it towards the center would divide the noise pixels equally.\n3. Moving the object toward the center gives us the desired output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0].\n\nAnalysis: The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nRating: 10/10\n\nExample\\_2:\n\n* Input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation steps to Example\\_2:\n\n1. There is one connected component (object) in the input sequence: one with color 4 starting at index 0 and ending at index 5.\n2. The leftmost object (with color 4) has noise pixels to its right but not to its left. Therefore, moving it towards the center would put it next to the existing noise pixels to its right.\n3. Moving the object toward the center gives us the desired output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0].\n\nAnalysis: The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nRating: 10/10\n\nExample\\_3:\n\n* Input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n* Output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n\nApplying the transformation steps to Example\\_3:\n\n1. There is one connected component (object) in the input sequence: one with color 8 starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.\n2. The leftmost object (with color 8) has noise pixels to its right but not to its left. Therefore, moving it towards the center would put it next to the existing noise pixels to its right.\n3. Moving the object toward the center gives us the desired output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0].\n\nAnalysis: The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nRating: 10/10\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    },\n    \"Example_2\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n        \"value\": 10\n    }\n}\n```"

Identify the first object in the sequence. In this case, it is the object with color 6, starting at index 0, ending at index 3, and having a size of 4.\n2. Remove the identified object from its original position in the sequence. This results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n3. Insert the removed object at the end of the sequence.

Here is my analysis:\n\nInput description:\nThe input consists of a single object with color 6, starting at index 0, ending at index 3, and having a size of 4.\n\nTransformation:\n1. Find the first non-background (non-zero) color. In this case, it is color 6.\n2. Move the entire object to the far right of the sequence while preserving its relative order. To do so, perform the following substeps:\na. Determine the number of noise pixels needed by subtracting the length of the object from the total sequence length and adding one (for the initial non-background color). In this case, we need 7 - 4 + 1 = 4 noise pixels.\nb. Insert the noise pixels after the object. These noise pixels can have any value between 0 and 9 since they don't affect the final result. Let's assume they are 0.\nc. Append the original object to the end of the sequence.\n\nTransformed objects:\nA single object with color 6 appears at the very end of the sequence, starting at index 6, ending at index 9, and having a size of 4.\n\nOutput:\n```python\nnumpy.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6])\n```\n\nIn summary, the input is transformed by moving the non-background object to the far right of the sequence while maintaining the object's internal structure. This results in the output sequence shown above.\n------\n Based on the provided information, I will first analyze the given examples and try to understand the underlying pattern. Then, I will apply the learned transformation to the test case. Here's my response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"input_description\": \"In the test input, there is one object with color 6.

Then, I will apply this pattern to the test case and provide the required output.\n\nGeneral Transformation Pattern:\n1.

In this case, the objects are located at the beginning of the input sequence. Following the conditions mentioned above, these objects should stay at the beginning of the output sequence.\n\nTo evaluate the correctness of the test output sequence, we would compare it to the expected output when considering the described transformation rules. Since there's no test output sequence provided, I cannot determine whether the hypothetical test output sequence adheres to the established rules. I can only confirm that the expected test output sequence would look like this:\n\nExpected test output sequence: `[6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nSince there is no test output sequence provided, I cannot rate the accuracy of the transformation.
