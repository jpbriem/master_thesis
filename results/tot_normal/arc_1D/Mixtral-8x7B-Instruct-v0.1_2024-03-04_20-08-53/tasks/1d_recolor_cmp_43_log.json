The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': \"based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size?

In order to create a more accurate and generalizable model, we need additional information about the rule governing these color changes.\n\nAs an initial step toward creating such a model, let us define our objective using a function called `transform_image`. Given an input image, this function will output an updated image based on some well-defined criteria. To begin constructing this function, we must first identify what properties of the input cause a particular connected component to undergo a color change. Examples can help us form hypotheses about these properties.\n\nFrom `Example_1`, we see that a group of consecutive color-2 pixels with length greater than or equal to 5 causes the central region of this group to transition to color 6. Let us call this property the `run_length`. We might hypothesize then, that any connected component satisfying this criterion triggers the color change.\n\nUpon examining `Example_2` and `Example_3`, however, we notice that this hypothesis alone is insufficient. Neither of these cases features a single contiguous segment of five or more color-2 pixels; instead they contain multiple smaller segments separated by intervening color-0 \"background\" pixels. Despite this difference, both still exhibit a color change from color 2 to color 6. Therefore, we cannot limit ourselves to considering solely run lengths within individual components but rather ought to consider the summed run length across all color-2 segments within the entire connected component. If the total run length meets or exceeds a threshold value, a color change takes place in the affected region.\n\nNow we have identified a potential set of conditions sufficient for characterizing the desired transformation. Using these insights, we can proceed to implement the function `transform_image`. But before doing so, let us examine the quality of our hypothesized conditions by evaluating them against several test cases beyond just those presented here. After ensuring satisfactory performance across many diverse images, we may feel confident in deploying our model to generate the required outputs.\n------\n Here's the JSON response as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"For Example_1, the given condition is implicit - any contiguous sequence of non-zero identical integers remains unchanged during the transformation.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

Specifically, the color changes to a new value calculated using the old color and 6 as a reference point:\n\n* If the difference between the old color and 6 is positive, subtract half of this difference (rounded down), add 6, and apply the result as the new color. This effectively shifts the color towards 6 while keeping it within the range of valid color values (1-9).\n* Otherwise, if the difference between the old color and 6 is nonpositive, leave the color unchanged.\n\nTherefore, we can identify two main conditions determining the transformation:\n\n1. Horizontal alignment of colored objects at either end of the input sequence.\n2. A specific arithmetic operation performed on the color values of horizontally aligned objects.\n------\n Based on the provided examples, here are the general transformation steps and conditions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"For each object in the input sequence, if it is surrounded by background (0) pixels and there are no other objects of the same color adjacent to it, then apply the transformation steps.\",\n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify objects in the input sequence that meet the specified condition.\",\n    \"Step 2: For each identified object, replace all pixels in the object with the next integer value after the current pixel value. This will effectively'recolor' the object while preserving its shape and location.\",\n    \"Step 3: If the new pixel value is greater than or equal to 9, wrap around to 1.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given examples, we can observe that when an object meets the specified condition (surrounded by background pixels and no other objects of the same color adjacent), it gets \"rec colored\" to the next integer value after its current pixel value. Additionally, any resulting pixel values greater than or equal to 9 wrap around to 1.\n------\n Based on the provided input-output pairs, it can be observed that there are two types of objects present in the input sequences - one represented by the number 2 and another represented by the number 0 (background color). It appears that the transformation being applied here involves modifying the object represented by the number 2 based on some conditions related to the presence and arrangement of other objects around it. More specifically, if a group of consecutive pixels with value 2 has another object (represented by any non-zero integer) at either side or both sides, then the value of each pixel in this group is incremented by 4. Otherwise, no change is made to the input sequence. Here are the detailed transformation steps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"Given a 1D pixel array where adjacent pixels of the same color form objects and 0 represents the background color.\\n\\n- Objects having color value equal to 2 appear in groups separated by the background color 0.\",\n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Initialize an empty array `transformed` of the same length as the input array.\",\n      \"action\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Iterate over each element in the input array starting from index 1 (skipping first element since it is always 0).\",\n      \"condition\": \"- Current element's value!= 0 (non-background)\",\n      \"action\": \"Let `curr_obj = current element's value`, `prev_pixel = previous pixel's value`, `next_pixel = next pixel's value`.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the left and right neighbors.\",\n      \"condition\": \"`prev_pixel!= 0 && curr_obj == 2` OR `next_pixel!= 0 && curr_obj == 2`\",\n      \"action\": \"Add 4 to the `curr_obj` value before adding it to `transformed` array.\",\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"If none of the left and right neighbor conditions were met above.\",\n      \"condition\": \"`prev_pixel == 0 && next_pixel == 0 && curr_obj == 2`\",\n      \"action\": \"Copy the `curr_obj` directly to the `transformed` array without changing the value.\",\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided examples, here are the general transformation steps and conditions in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"For each object, if there is no noise pixel to its left and right, and it has at least two other identical objects aligned vertically above and below it, then replace the colors of this object and the aligned objects with a new color.\",\n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    \"1. Identify and group adjacent pixels of the same color as objects.\",\n    \"2. Iterate through each object.\",\n    \"   a. Check if there is a noise pixel (0) to the immediate left and right of the current object.\",\n    \"   b. If so, continue to the next object. Otherwise, proceed to step c.\",\n    \"   c. Check if there are at least two other identical objects aligned vertically above and below the current object.\",\n    \"   d. If so, replace the color of the current object and the aligned objects with the target color.\",\n    \"   e. Move on to the next object.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn these examples, the condition checks whether an object meets certain criteria, and the transformation steps outline how to modify those identified objects accordingly. Note that the implementation details will depend on the programming language used.#############################\nNext node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

The object composed of 2s is recolored to 6s, and since some new pixel values exceed 9, step 3 is applied appropriately to wrap them around to 1s. However, it is worth noting that the recoloring process does not follow the exact order provided in the steps. Instead of incrementing by 1, the pixels are changed to 6 directly, skipping over intermediate integer values. Nonetheless, this inconsistency does not affect the final result, as the correct output is still obtained.\nvalue: 8\n\nExample\\_3:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Regarding the third example, the transformation steps fail to accurately describe the transformation process. While the resulting output is generated correctly (with the object composed of 2s being recolored to 6s), the transformation steps themselves do not account for how this change occurs. Specifically, there is no clear condition specified in step 1 for identifying the relevant object. Moreover, the manner in which the recoloring takes place remains unclear, as it involves skipping over intermediate integer values when updating the pixel values.\nvalue: 3\n\nIn summary, although the transformation steps produce the desired output for all examples, they fall short of accurately describing the transformation process itself, particularly for Examples 2 and 3. It would be more appropriate to provide a precise description of the transformation directly rather than attempting to represent it through these general steps.\n------\n Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:\n\nExample\\_1:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the transformation steps correctly identify the object consisting of 2s and recolor them to 6s. However, there is no mention of how to handle the case where the new pixel value is greater than or equal to the maximum allowed value (9). In this example, none of the recolored pixels exceed the value of 6, so it doesn't affect the result. But, based on the given transformation steps, any object made up of pixels with a value of 8 would incorrectly get mapped to 9 instead of wrapping around to 1. Therefore, there is an inconsistency between the provided transformation steps and the actual transformation being performed.\n\nvalue: 7\n\nExample\\_2:\ntransformation\\_analysis: Similar to Example\\_1, the transformation steps correctly identify the object consisting of 2s and recolor them to 6s. Again, there is no mention of how to handle the case where the new pixel value is greater than or equal to the maximum allowed value (9), but in this example, it doesn't cause any issues since none of the recolored pixels exceed the value of 6. Nonetheless, the lack of guidance for handling higher pixel values raises concerns about consistency.\n\nvalue: 7\n\nExample\\_3:\ntransformation\\_analysis: In this example, we can see an issue related to identifying objects when the object has adjacent non-object pixels in between. The original object consists of two sections separated by a single non-object pixel. According to the given transformation steps, these two parts should be treated as separate objects and therefore recolored independently. Instead, the entire section is recolored as one single object, suggesting that the algorithm merges or ignores adjacent non-object pixels during the identification process. It contradicts the assumption that the algorithm processes each connected component separately and highlights potential ambiguity in the transformation definition.\n\nvalue: 5\n\nOverall, the given transformation steps do not cover edge cases and may lead to inconsistent results. Specifically, they fail to address instances where the newly generated pixel value might exceed the maximum allowed value (9) and how to treat adjacent non-object pixels within objects. Additionally, there is uncertainty about how the algorithm identifies connected components. As a result, it cannot be confirmed whether the given transformation steps work accurately across various examples.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Similar to previous examples, adjacent groups of the same non-zero color may stay unchanged or get substituted by new colors (6) depending on whether any neighboring groups exist before or after them, separated by at least one zero. Moreover, in cases where two separate groups of the same color (2) appear consecutively, they merge together.\n\nAnalysis Summary:\nA clear pattern across the three examples is the potential modification of adjacent groups of the same non-zero color in the input sequence, depending on the existence of neighboring groups separated by at least one zero. Such modifications seem to preserve contiguity and relative positions of these colored regions throughout the process. Additionally, merging of consecutive identical groups occurs irrespective of separating zeros.\n\nHowever, no specific transformation steps were provided to assess.

In the output sequence, these two consecutive objects have been replaced by a single object with color 6 and length 13. This aligns with the transformation steps provided because both preceding and succeeding pixels of the input objects are noise pixels (0), which satisfies the condition to replace the object's value with the target color value (6). Therefore, it can be concluded that the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.\",\n\"value\": 10\n},\n\"Example\\_2\": {\n\"transformation\\_analysis\": \"In Example\\_2, the input sequence consists of two separate objects with color 2, where the second object also contains three consecutive sub-objects with color 2.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\n\noverall pattern: None\n\ntransformation steps: None\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Input description: The input sequence contains one object of color 2, which appears three times consecutively at the beginning of the sequence, followed by another object of color 2 with a size of 7. There is a gap of 3 zeros between the two objects. At the end of the sequence, there is another object of color 2 with a size of 5.\n\nTransformation: First, we identify the objects in the input sequence. There are three objects with color 2. We then apply the transformation rule, which states that if an object has a size greater than or equal to 3, then increase the color value of that object by 4. In this case, the second object meets this criterion, so we add 4 to the color value, making it 6. The first and third objects do not meet the criterion, so their color values remain unchanged.\n\nTransformed objects: After applying the transformation, the middle object will have a color value of 6 instead of 2. Therefore, the transformed sequence will contain one object of color 2 at the beginning, followed by an object of color 6 with a size of 7, and finally, another object of color 2 at the end.\n\nOutput: Based on the above analysis, the transformed output sequence would be:\n\n[0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"Input sequence contains one object of color 2 with a size of 3 at the beginning, one object of color 2 with a size of 7, and one object of color 2 with a size of 5 at the end.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"If an object has a size greater than or equal to 3, then increase the color value of that object by 4.

Object_1 has a color value of 2, starts at index 1, ends at index 7, and has a size of 7. Object_2 has a color value of 2, starts at index 10, ends at index 16, and has a size of 7.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Step_1: Identify adjacent pixels of the same color and consider them as objects. This is already done in the input description section. Step_2: Find the leftmost object (in this case, Object_1) and apply the transformation function f(x) = x + 4 to it. So, the new color becomes 2 + 4 = 6. Step_3: Leave the second object unchanged since it doesn\u2019t meet the condition \u2018if there exists another object before the current one\u2019. The final transformed output will be [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"In the transformed output, Object_1 remains intact but with a modified color value 6 instead of 2. Its position and size remain the same i.e., starts at index 1, ends at index 7, and has a size of 7. The second object, Object_2, hasn't changed because no transformation was applied to it according to rule 3.\",\n    \"output\": \"[0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: I assumed the transformation function f(x) = x + 4 based on the patterns observed in the example cases. If there is any discrepancy, please let me know so I can correct it accordingly.\n------\n Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation involves identifying consecutive groups of non-background pixels (i.e., objects) and changing their color based on certain conditions. Specifically, if there are two objects next to each other, then the first object's color is increased by 4. Here are the details for each field of the output JSON:\n\n* `input_description`: In the test input sequence, we have one object of color 2 with a size of 3 at the beginning, followed by another object of color 2 with a size of 7. There are no noise pixels in this input sequence.\n* `transformation`: To apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, we follow these steps:\n\t1. Identify the objects in the input sequence:\n\t```css\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": 2,\n    \"start_index\": 1,\n    \"end_index\": 3,\n    \"size\": 3\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": 2,\n    \"start_index\": 6,\n    \"end_index\": 12,\n    \"size\": 7\n  }\n]\n```\n\t2. Check if there are multiple objects adjacent to each other. In this case, yes - the second object immediately follows the first object without any intervening background pixels.\n\t3. Change the color of the first object to 6 + original color since another object follows directly after it. Therefore, the updated color becomes 2 + 4 = 6.\n\t```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": 6,\n    \"start_index\": 1,\n    \"end_index\": 3,\n    \"size\": 3\n  },\n ...\n]\n```\n\t4. Since the first object has been modified, the input now looks like:\n\t```less\n[0, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\t5. We continue processing the rest of the input sequence using the previous steps until we reach the end of the input. However, since there are no more objects left in the input sequence, no further changes will occur.\n* `transformed_objects`: After applying the transformation steps to the objects, they should appear as follows in the test output sequence:\n\t```json\n[\n  {\n    \"color\": 6,\n    \"start_index\": 1,\n    \"end_index\": 3,\n    \"size\": 3\n  },\n  {\n    \"color\": 6,\n    \"start_index\": 6,\n    \"end_index\": 12,\n    \"size\": 7\n  }\n]\n```\n* `output`: Finally, return the resulting test output sequence as a NumPy array:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nnp.array([0, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n------\n Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation involves increasing the value of pixels in objects by 4 if the object has at least one non-background pixel to its left or right (i.e., if the object is not at the edge of the sequence). Here are the details for each field in the JSON response:\n\n* `input_description`: The input contains two objects. Object 1 has a color of 2, starts at index 1, ends at index 7, and has a size of 7. Object 2 has a color of 2, starts at index 13, ends at index 19, and has a size of 7. There are no noise pixels.\n* `transformation`: First, loop through the input sequence and identify the objects. Then, check if each object has any non-background pixels to its left or right. If so, increase the value of each pixel in the object by 4. In this case, both objects have non-background pixels to their left, but only Object 2 has non-background pixels to its right. Therefore, we will increase the value of each pixel in Object 1 by 4, and the value of each pixel in Object 2 by 4.\n* `transformed_objects`: After applying the transformation, Object 1 has a color of 6, and Object 2 has a color of 6. The rest of the properties for each object remain unchanged.\n* `output`: The resulting output sequence after applying the transformation is:\n```css\n[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nNote that the numpy array representation of this output would be:\n```python\nnp.array([0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\nTherefore, the final JSON response would be:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"The input contains two objects. Object 1 has a color of 2, starts at index 1, ends at index 7, and has a size of 7. Object 2 has a color of 2, starts at index 13, ends at index 19, and has a size of 7.

Also notice that the second region with pixel value 2 at indices [10, 16] remains unchanged with pixel value 2 in the output. This difference in treatment appears due to the presence of other pixel values surrounding the first region but not present around the second region. Specifically, the presence of zeros preceding and succeeding the first region seems significant, whereas the second region is surrounded completely by zeros in the input.\n\nStep 3: After carefully investigating the differences in the transformation of the two regions mentioned above, I cannot find any justification for why the first region should change to pixel value 6 while the second region stays the same since they both contain pixel value 2. Moreover, some examples provided show completely different behavior when comparing regions with like pixel values - such as Example_2 where two regions containing pixel value 2 remain the same despite having zeros before and after them.\n\nGiven the inconsistencies found during the examination of transformation rules across various examples including this test case, it's difficult to accurately analyze whether the test output sequence has been obtained through the correct application of the transformation algorithm. However, considering that there doesn't seem to be a clear rationale behind the changes made to certain regions over others containing similar pixel values, I feel compelled to rate the test output unfavorably.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the discrepancies discovered in applying the transformation algorithm consistently across multiple instances, it is challenging to determine if the test output sequence has resulted from a proper application of the transformation algorithm; however, based on my investigation, I am inclined to believe otherwise.', 'value': '1'}\n------\n Based on the provided information, here is the evaluation of the test output sequence:\n\nFirst, let's define the overall pattern based on the given examples: Given an object of color `c` in the input sequence, if it is followed by another object of the same color `c`, then replace the second occurrence of `c` with `6`. If it is not followed by another object of the same color, leave it unchanged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the test output sequence against the transformation steps:\n\n1. Starting from the first non-zero element (ignoring leading zeros), we see the color `2` appears twice consecutively at positions 1 and 2. In the test output sequence, these two `2`s remain unchanged, while they should have been transformed into `2` and `6` accordingly.\n2. Moving forward, there is an object of color `2` starting at index 9 and ending at index 11. This is followed by another object of the same color `2` starting at index 12. However, in the test output sequence, both `2`s remain unchanged instead of being transformed into `2` and `6` accordingly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the given test output sequence does not follow the correct transformation according to the defined pattern, resulting in incorrect handling of consecutive objects with the same color.

To determine whether this transformation has been applied correctly to the test input sequence, we will examine the given test output sequence and compare it against what we would expect based on the rules derived from the examples.\n\nLet's first define some common elements across the examples:\n\n* Input and output sequences represent a single row of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9 (excluding 0 for background), where adjacent pixels of the same color form an object.\n* In each example, there is at least one pair of colors (A and B) involved in the transformation, where A gets replaced by B under specific conditions.\n* Transformations occur when there are consecutive sequences of specific length(s) made up of color A followed by background (0) and then another sequence of specific length(s) consisting of the same color A.\n\nFrom these observations, let's derive more concrete rules that seem to apply to the given examples:\n\nRULE 1: If two consecutive sequences of the same length exist, separated by a single background pixel, replace the second sequence with the new color, maintaining the original length.\n\nFor instance, consider Example\\_1:\n\n* Sequence 1 consists of `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` starting at index 1 and ending at index 6.\n* There is a background pixel at index 7.\n* Sequence 2 consists of `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` starting at index 8 and ending at index 13.\n\nIn the transformed output, the second sequence becomes `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`. This rule seems to apply similarly to Examples\\_2 and 3.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the test input and output using our extracted rule:\n\nTest Input: `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nTest Output: `[0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n\nApplying RULE 1:\n\n* Sequence 1 consists of `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` starting at index 1 and ending at index 6.\n* There is a background pixel at index 7.\n* Sequence 2 consist of `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` starting at index 8 and ending at index 14.\n\nHowever, the provided Test Output does not follow the extracted rule because the second sequence did not get changed to `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`, but instead remains unchanged. Thus, the provided Test Output fails to pass our evaluation criteria.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\\n\\nStep 1 - Applying Rule 1: FAIL\\n', 'value': 0}\n------\n Based on the given examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n\nOverall pattern: In the output sequence, when there is a continuous sequence of at least two 2's surrounded by zeros, it gets replaced by sixes (also surrounded by zeros) of the same length. Other sequences of 2's may remain unchanged.\n\nTransformation steps:\n1. Identify consecutive groups of at least two 2's.\n2.

However, the second run (of length 7) remains unchanged instead of being converted to sixes like the rest of the runs.

However, based on the provided input-output pairs and their shared pattern, I will make some assumptions about the transformation steps and provide an initial evaluation.\n\nIf I understand the problem correctly, the objective is to identify adjacent objects with the same color and replace them with new colors that don't exist in the original sequence while preserving non-object regions (i.e., pixels marked with 0). In this case, one way to approach this would be using Flood Fill algorithm. Here are my assumptions regarding the transformation steps:\n\n1. Iterate through the input sequence scanning for connected components of object pixels (pixels other than 0) with the same color.\n2. Replace each connected component found in the previous step with a new color value.\n\nNow let's assume the test output sequence has been created according to these rules.

This new value seems to depend on the length of the group of pixels.\n* Pixels with a value of 0 (background color) remain unchanged in the output sequence.\n\nWithout knowing the exact mapping of object lengths to replacement values, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the correctness of the test output. However, assuming the same transformation rules apply to the test case, we can see that there is no single consecutive group of pixels with the same non-zero value longer than two in the test input sequence. Therefore, the expected output sequence should contain only zeros and possibly the values originally present in the input sequence but not introduced during the transformation process (i.e., no new values). If any other non-zero values appear in the test output sequence, then the transformation has not been applied correctly.\n\nGiven this limited information, a conservative approach would be to rate the test output sequence low due to insufficient information about the transformation steps.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'There is not enough information about the transformation steps or overall pattern.

Moreover, the newly introduced colored objects seem to follow some specific rules related to their neighboring objects. Here is the analysis based on these observations:\n\n1. In Example\\_1, the object `{color: 2, start_index: 8, end_index: 15}` with size 8 is replaced by a new object `{color: 6, start_index: 8, end_index: 15}` with size 8. This rule seems to apply to other examples too.\n2. Similarly, in Example\\_2, the object `{color: 2, start_index: 7, end_index: 10}` with size 4 is replaced by a new object `{color: 6, start_index: 7, end_index: 10}` with size 4.\n3.

Based on the given examples, I would rate the correctness of the test output sequence as **8 out of 10**.

This ensures that adjacent pixels remain connected.\n\nTransformation steps:\n\n1. Identify objects in the input sequence based on their non-zero value and consecutive occurrence.\n2. Modify object pixels by adding 4 (modulo 9) while preserving the background (0).\n\nNow, let's assume the following test output sequence is given:\n\nTest output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAnalyzing the transformation for the test input and output sequences:\n\n1.

Applying Steps 3 and 4, our updated sequence would look like this:\n\n[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRating: Since I don't have enough context about the condition in Step 2, I am unable to validate whether the test output sequence aligns with the expected outcome after applying the transformation steps accurately. Therefore, I cannot confidently assign a numeric rating to the test output sequence based on the information provided.\n\nIn conclusion, more information regarding the conditions in Step 2 is required before making any judgments about the correctness of the test output sequence. In addition, providing the test output sequence would enable us to compare and verify the results directly.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Identify all objects in the input sequence.\n2. Check if each object meets the condition mentioned in the 'conditions' field (which is not provided, but based on examples, I assume objects with more than two consecutive pixels of the same color meet the condition).\n3. Replace the color of pixels in meeting the condition with the new color (6).\n4. Leave all other objects unchanged.\n\nNow let's examine the given test input and output sequences considering these steps:\n\n1. Input has identified objects:\n   - Object_1: {color: 2, start\\_index: 1, end\\_index: 3, size: 3}\n   - Object_2: {color: 2, start\\_index: 4, end\\_index: 10, size: 7}\n   - Object_3: {color: 2, start\\_index: 18, end\\_index: 20, size: 3}\n\n2. We apply the missing condition; only Object\\_2 meets it since it has more than two consecutive pixels of the same color.\n3. Replacing the color of Object\\_2 with 6, we get the expected output sequence:\n   [0, 2, 2, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, 0, 0, **6**, **6**, **6**, **6**, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n4. Comparing our expected output to the given test output, there seems to be an issue; they don't match.\n\nSince the transformation wasn't correctly followed according to the given description, the example cannot rate higher than 0 out of 10 regarding accuracy in processing the test case:\n\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze whether the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output sequence by considering each step of the transformation algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\nFor the given input, we can identify two objects:\n- Object 1: {color: 2, start\\_index: 1, end\\_index: 6, size: 6}\n- Object 2: {color: 2, start\\_index: 11, end\\_index: 18, size: 8}\n\nStep 2: For each object, check if it meets the condition mentioned in the 'conditions' field.\nSince there is no specific condition provided, I assume that any object containing consecutive equal values qualifies for replacement. In this case, both objects meet the condition.\n\nStep 3: If an object meets the condition, replace the color of its pixels with the new color (6 in this case).\nLet's apply the change to Object 1:\n- Updated Object 1: {color: 6, start\\_index: 1, end\\_index: 6, size: 6}\n\nHowever, for Object 2, the expected output has some inconsistencies when compared to Examples 1, 2, and 3. We would expect parts of Object 2 to remain untouched since the original color is 2, but here, the entire Object 2 seems to be replaced with 6. This contradicts the instructions in Step 4.\n\nAssuming that there was an error in replacing Object 2 during the test, the correct partial output after applying Step 3 should look like the following:\n\n[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut due to the mismatch between the actual and expected behavior, further analysis isn't required. Nonetheless, I will complete the final step assuming everything else was conducted correctly.\n\nStep 4: Leave all other objects unchanged.\nIf every other aspect of the transformation process was done accurately, then no additional modifications need to be made based on this last instruction. However, because of the discrepancies found in Step 3, this assumption cannot be verified.\n\nGiven my findings, I cannot confidently provide a rating without clarification about how to handle cases where multiple consecutive objects with the same value appear adjacent to one another. With the available data, I believe the test outcome might contain errors. But to ensure fairness, I will rate based on the closest correct output achievable with the current instructions and assumptions.\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.

In our test input sequence, there are three objects that meet the criteria specified: two consecutive twos starting at index 0, a group of six consecutive twos starting at index 5, and another set of four consecutive twos starting at index 17.\n\nNext, we move on to Step 2 - 'For each object, check if it meets the condition mentioned in the 'conditions' field.' However, no specific conditions were defined in the input data; therefore, I assume the intention is to replace any object where more than half of its length consists of adjacently placed equal numbers. By this assumption, both the first and second objects match these conditions (both consist entirely of sequential twos), but the third does not since less than half (only one quarter) of the elements in the final object comply with this requirement.\n\nThen, per Step 3 - 'If an object meets the condition, replace the color of its pixels with the new color (6 in this case)', we would modify the color value of the first and second objects found above. \n\nLastly, according to Step 4 - 'Leave all other objects unchanged', the third object remains untouched. But when comparing the expected output against the actual result, we notice discrepancies regarding the treatment of the last object. Since less than half of the elements complied with our conditions, it shouldn't have been altered during the transformation process. Thus, our conclusion is that the provided test output seems incorrect based on the described transformation rules provided.\n\nIn summary, {'test_output_analysis': 'During the evaluation of each step of the transformation algorithm, various inconsistencies were identified between the test input sequence and the test output sequence. Specifically, issues arose concerning condition application and handling of non-matching objects. As such, a low confidence exists in the accuracy of the test output sequence.', 'value': '3'}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let us evaluate the test output sequence by considering each step of the transformation algorithm.\n\nStep 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.\nIn the input sequence [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we can identify two objects:\n\n* Object A: Color = 2, Start Index = 1, End Index = 5\n* Object B: Color = 2, Start Index = 10, End Index = 14\n* Object C: Color = 2, Start Index = 15, End Index = 18\n\nStep 2: For each object, check if it meets the condition mentioned in the 'conditions' field.\nSince no specific conditions were provided, let us assume that every object is being checked against some predefined criteria outside the scope of these steps. We don't know what those conditions might be; therefore, we cannot determine whether any object meets them.\n\nHowever, since there's no explicit instruction about filtering out objects based on their properties, let us continue evaluating Step 3 assuming all identified objects meet the required conditions.\n\nStep 3: If an object meets the condition, replace the color of its pixels with the new color (6 in this case).\nIf all three objects meet the condition, they will be replaced with color 6:\n\n* Object A: Replaced with Color = 6, Start Index = 1, End Index = 5 => [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0,...]\n* Object B: Replaced with Color = 6, Start Index = 10, End Index = 14 => [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0,...]\n* Object C: Replaced with Color = 6, Start Index = 15, End Index = 18 => [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0,...]\n\nStep 4: Leave all other objects unchanged.\nThere are no other objects present in the input sequence. Therefore, no further changes need to be made.\n\nAfter applying Steps 1 through 4 to the test input sequence, we get:\n[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nComparing our result with the given test output sequence [0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], we notice that the first object was not transformed as expected. In the actual output, the original object has color 2 instead of 6. This discrepancy shows that either the transformation algorithm wasn't applied correctly, or some essential piece of information about the conditions for replacement is missing.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would rate the test output sequence a 3 out of 10 because most of the sequence matches the expected output but one significant part does not."
