The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Shift each object towards the beginning of the sequence by subtracting the respective first non-zero pixel's index from all elements in the object.\",\n    \"3. Merge the shifted objects and noise pixels together.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. In each example, there is always at least one object present in the input sequence. This condition ensures we can apply our transformation logic.\n2. Since each object starts and ends with zero pixels, shifting them toward the beginning doesn't require us to consider overlapping with other objects. We just need to make sure no two objects merge during this process.\n3. First non-zero pixel indexes help us keep track of where to shift each object without merging them while performing the shift. After all shifts, simply merge the remaining objects and noise pixels together.\n\nAlthough there are no explicit description or overall patterns mentioned for these examples, these transformation steps seem to generalize well across the three cases provided.\n------\n Based on the provided examples, here are the general transformation steps and conditions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"conditions\": \"The input sequence contains one contiguous object (i.e., a group of adjacent pixels with the same color) surrounded by zeros or beginning/ending the sequence.\",\n  \"transformation_steps\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the object's color\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Since there is only one object, identify its color to proceed with further operations.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the start and end indices of the object\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Locate the first and last indices where the object's color appears consecutively in the input sequence.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if the object starts at index 0\",\n      \"explanation\": \"If it does, keep the initial zeros intact; otherwise, add leading zeros before the object's starting index.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Add trailing zeros after the object\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Ensure that the length of the output sequence matches the original input length by appending zeros after the object until the desired length is achieved.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Move the object to the correct position\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Place the identified object immediately after the leading zeros added previously so that it appears closer to the center of the output sequence.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\n\noverall pattern: None\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Step 1: Merge any adjacent objects with the same color, increasing their sizes accordingly.', 'Step 2: Identify any objects surrounded by zeros at both ends.', 'Step 3: Shift the identified objects towards the non-zero side, preserving the original order of objects.']\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Here is the JSON object containing the analysis and ratings for each example based on the provided transformation steps:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"In Example_1, Step 1 (Merge) merges the consecutive objects with the same color successfully without changing their order. In Step 2 (Identify), no objects need to be identified since there are no objects surrounded by zeros at both ends. In Step 3 (Shift), there's also no shifting action required because none of the objects meet the criteria specified in Step 2.\",\n        \"value\": 7\n    },\n    \"Example_2\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, Step 1 (Merge) works properly. However, unlike Example_1, we do have an object meeting the criteria in Step 2 (Identify): {color: 5, start_index: 8, end_index: 16}. Finally, in Step 3 (Shift), this object gets shifted towards the non-zero side correctly, resulting in the desired output sequence.\",\n        \"value\": 9\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"transformation_analysis\": \"Like previous examples, Step 1 (Merge) performs as expected. We don't have any objects matching the conditions described in Step 2 (Identify). Nevertheless, in Step 3 (Shift) the algorithm shifts the very first object ({color: 1, start_index: 1, end_index: 7}) one index to the left, making it adhere to the original order, even though it isn't strictly necessary according to the description.\",\n        \"value\": 8\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, I gave a rating of 7 for Example\\_1, 9 for Example\\_2, and 8 for Example\\_3. Overall, these transformation steps accurately depict the process but may contain minor ambiguities leading to some unnecessary actions in specific scenarios. Nonetheless, the main idea behind those steps remains correct.\n------\n Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps based on the provided examples:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"For Example_1, Step 1 merges the adjacent objects with the same color (3) successfully. However, there are no instances where an object is surrounded by zeros at both ends, so Step 2 has no effect. In Step 3, since there are no objects surrounded by zeros at both ends, this step also has no effect. Overall, the transformation steps do not fully transform the input to the desired output.\",\n    \"value\": \"5\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, Step 1 works correctly, but Steps 2 and 3 have no impact again due to the absence of objects surrounded by zeros at both ends. Therefore, the transformation steps need improvement to produce the expected output.\",\n    \"value\": \"5\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"In Example_3, Step 1 functions correctly, but like previous examples, Steps 2 and 3 don't apply because there are no objects surrounded by zeros at both ends. Thus, more comprehensive transformation steps are required to achieve the desired outcome.\",\n    \"value\": \"5\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBased on my analysis, I would rate the transformation steps a 5 out of 10 for each example because the given steps fail to account for shifting objects toward the non-zero side when surrounded by zeros at both ends. Additionally, the current steps don't affect the output even when applicable, indicating room for improvement."

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}.

Afterward, I will apply these assumptions to the test case.\n\nAssumptions:\nDescription: The input contains one long object (L) made up of several connected pixels with a single color.\nOverall Pattern: In the output, if there is a non-zero pixel at position i, then there must be a non-zero pixel at position L - i, where L is the length of the object.\nTransformation Steps:\n1. Find the first non-zero pixel index (i).\n2. Find the last non-zero pixel index (j).\n3. Create a copy of the subarray from i to j (copy = input[i:j+1]).\n4. Reverse the copy (reversed\\_copy = copy[::-1]).\n5. Insert the reversed\\_copy into the original array at position j + 1 (input[j+1:j+1] = reversed\\_copy).\n6. Return the input after applying the transformation steps.\n\nInput Description for Test Case:\nThe input contains a single object of length 27. All the pixels have the color 8.\n\nTransformation:\nApplying the transformation steps:\n1. First non-zero pixel index: i = 5.\n2. Last non-zero pixel index: j = 31.\n3. Copy subarray: copy = input[5:32].\n4. Reversed copy: reversed\\_copy = [8, 8, 8,..., 8, 8, 8].\n5. Insert reversed\\_copy: input[32:32] = reversed\\_copy.\n\nTransformed Objects:\nIn the test output, the object will have the same color (8), but it will be mirrored around the middle point: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nOutput:\nReturning the resulting test output sequence as a NumPy array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\noutput = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n```\n------\n Based on the provided examples and the absence of specific instructions, I will make some assumptions about the underlying pattern. It seems that the task requires moving the first non-background object to the beginning of the sequence while preserving other objects' positions. If there are no non-background objects, then the output remains the same as the input. Here are the details:\n\nInput description: In this particular test input, we observe one connected component consisting of 16 consecutive pixels with a value of 8 at the center. Since it appears at the beginning of the sequence, there is no change regarding the position.\n\nTransformation: Examine the input sequence and identify the leftmost non-background object (if any). Then, move it to the beginning of the sequence without changing the order of other objects. In this test case, since the leftmost object starts at index 5 and ends at index 20 (inclusive), we need to shift these indices by -5 after removing leading zeros.\n\nTransformed objects: After applying the transformation, the 16 consecutive pixels of value 8 appear at the beginning of the sequence while preserving their original relative arrangement. Thus, the first object has a size of 16, a single color value (8), and starting and ending indices adjusted accordingly.\n\nOutput: Considering the mentioned assumptions, here's the expected output:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"In this input, there is a single object of 16 consecutive pixels with a value of 8.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Identify the leftmost non-zero object and shift it to the beginning of the sequence.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"There is a single object consisting of 16 consecutive pixels having a value of 8.\",\n    \"output\": [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, here's the response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"The input sequence contains one object with color 8, starting at index 5 and ending at index 25, with a size of 21. This means the object spans almost the entire sequence.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Starting from the first non-background pixel (which is the beginning of our object), we apply the transformation by shifting the object to the left by half its size (rounded down). In this case, half of 21 rounded down is 10. So, we shift the object 10 places to the left. Since the object was originally at indices 5 to 25, after shifting, it will be at indices -5 to 15. However, since array indices cannot be negative, we adjust them accordingly by adding the length of the array (27 in this case) to get a valid range of indices from 22 to 6.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"In the output sequence, the object of color 8 starts at index 22, ends at index 6, and has a size of 17. It has been shifted to the left by 10 positions compared to the input.\",\n    \"output\": \"Putting together the transformed object and the unchanged background, the output sequence is: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\n\nThe final line can be executed in Python to obtain the desired NumPy array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nprint(np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]))\n```\n------\n Based on the provided examples and the fact that there are no specific transformation steps, descriptions, or patterns given, I will make some assumptions about the transformation that needs to be applied. Since the examples show cases where groups of identical numbers (representing pixel colors) are shifted either to the right or left while removing leading or trailing zeros, it seems like the rule here is to shift the group of identical numbers to the right by one position, making room for a single instance of this number at the beginning of the sequence. Let's apply this transformation to the test case.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given input sequence:\n\nInput description: In the input sequence, we see a continuous sequence of eight consecutive eights (color 8), starting from index 5 and ending at index 22. This object has a color value of 8, begins at index 5, ends at index 22, and has a total size of 18 elements including itself.\n\nNow, applying our assumed transformation logic:\n\nTransformation: Move the entire group of 8s (object) two positions to the right, overwriting the first two zeros. Add a single 8 at the beginning of the sequence.\n\nTransformed objects: After applying the transformation, there will be a single 8 at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the rest of the original sequence without the initial two zeros. The original object remains unchanged except for its position; now, it starts at index 6 instead of 5. Additionally, there is a single 8 added at position 0.\n\nOutput: Here's the resulting test output sequence as a NumPy array:\n\nimport numpy as np\nresult = np.array([8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\nTo summarize, here's the JSON response:\n\n{\n'input_description': 'In the input sequence, we observe a continuous sequence of eighteen consecutive eights (color 8), starting from index 5 and extending till index 22.',\n'transformation': 'Move the group of eight consecutive eights two positions to the right and add a single 8 at the beginning of the sequence.',\n'transformed_objects': 'A single 8 appears at the beginning of the sequence, followed by the original sequence, excluding the first two zeros. The main object remains intact but has been moved two positions to the right, with the first element now at index 6 instead of index 5.',\n'output': result\n}#############################\nNext node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Specifically, when there is a single non-background object at the beginning of the sequence (as in Example\\_3), it remains in place. Otherwise, the first non-background object moves to the second position (as in Examples\\_1 and 2).\n\nHowever, without explicit transformation steps, we cannot perform a rigorous evaluation of the provided test case. Nevertheless, based on the observed pattern, one could reasonably infer the following transformation steps:\n\n1. Find the first non-background object's start index.\n2. If the first non-background object starts at index 0, leave it in place; otherwise, move it up by one index.\n3. Shift all subsequent elements left accordingly to maintain relative positions and preserve object sizes.\n4. Fill any newly created zeros at the end of the sequence with zeros.\n\nApplying these steps to the test case results in the following output:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince this output matches the expected result, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10. However, this assumption depends on the correctness of the inferred transformation steps.\n------\n Based on the given examples, the underlying pattern seems to be merging adjacent objects (consecutive series of identical non-zero digits) towards one direction - left or right, depending on whether they're preceded or followed by zeros. Here is how such transformation can occur according to this pattern:\n\n1. If there's an object at the beginning of the sequence that is preceded by zeros, leave it untouched.\n2. From the remaining objects, check the first pair of consecutive numbers (left digit belongs to one object while the right digit belongs to another object). Merge the smaller object into larger one based on their color value.\n3.

However, since no description, overall pattern, or transformation steps were given, it is difficult to perform a thorough evaluation. Nevertheless, I will still provide an analysis based on the available information and some assumptions.\n\nFirstly, let's make some general observations about the example input-output pairs. We can see that the main difference lies at the boundaries between adjacent groups of identical pixels (same color). Specifically, when moving from left to right, if there is a transition from a non-zero value to zero while traversing through an object (a group of consecutive identical pixels), this transition appears earlier in the output than in the input. Conversely, transitions from zero to non-zero values occur later in the output compared to the input. This observation hints at the fact that the algorithm may involve shifting the boundary positions depending on whether they correspond to an object or its surrounding background.\n\nNow, let's compare the test input and output sequences using this assumption. In the test case, the initial segment consists of zeros followed by a long sequence of 8s until another series of trailing zeros. By comparing the two sequences, we can observe that the first eight changed from zero to eight, matching our previous assumption regarding shifts happening later in the output. Moreover, the last nine eights changed from eight to zero, following our other assumption about shifts occurring earlier in the output. Therefore, based on these findings, it seems like the transformation might have been applied according to the observed pattern.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about the expected transformation process or more context about the desired behavior, it is hard to definitively state whether the test output is correct. Nonetheless, using the available information and making reasonable assumptions, it appears that the test output has undergone the same kind of boundary shift observed in the example cases.\n\nAs a result, considering the limitations mentioned above, I would rate the test output as follows:\n{\n\"test_output_analysis\": \"Considering the analyzed patterns in the example input-output pairs and assuming that the transformation involves boundary shifts depending on the context, the test input sequence appears to have been transformed accordingly.\",\n\"value\": \"8\"\n}\n\nPlease note that, ideally, we should have access to more precise details about the transformation steps to ensure a proper assessment.\n------\n Based on the provided information, here is an analysis of the test output sequence:\n\n1. Compare the lengths of the input and output sequences: Both sequences have the same length of 27. This is expected as there are no deletions or insertions in the transformation steps.\n2. Check if the first and last elements of the sequences match: In this case, both the input and output sequences start with 0 and end with 0.\n3. Identify continuous blocks of identical numbers in both sequences (excluding the first and last elements): There is one such block in the input sequence [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]. However, in the output sequence, it appears as [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nFrom these observations, we can conclude that the test output sequence does not adhere to the correct transformation of the input sequence. Specifically, the long block of consecutive 8s has been truncated at some point during the transformation process. Therefore, I would rate the test output as '2' out of '10'.\n\nIn summary:\n{\n\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n\"value\": 2\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

This can also be thought of as moving the starting index of each object to the leftmost position where the object's color appears. We will evaluate the given test output using this observation.\n\nLet us consider the given test input and test output:\n\nTest Input:\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nTest Output:\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nIn order to verify whether the given output follows the described transformation rules, we need to compare both sequences element-wise up until the point where the non-background values appear. In this case, the initial five elements in both sequences match, i.e., `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Now let us examine the actual objects present in the original sequence (ignoring the leading and trailing zeros):\n\nOriginal Test Case Sequence (objects only):\n`[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`\n\nTransformed Test Case Sequence (objects only):\n`[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]`\n\nIt can be observed that the objects themselves did not undergo any change after applying the transformation. Since there were no leading zeros before the beginning of these objects in the original sequence, there wasn't any possibility of shifting them either.

Check if the first non-zero value corresponds to the beginning of a contiguous non-background color block. However, in the test output sequence, there is no such block at the beginning. This indicates that the first step of the transformation was not applied correctly.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as a 1 out of 10 since it did not follow the expected transformation steps correctly.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

We find the first occurrence of the object:\n\n* First occurrence starts at index 5 and ends at index 16.\n\nStep 2: Shift each object towards the beginning of the sequence by subtracting the respective first non-zero pixel's index from all elements in the object.\n\nWe now shift the object accordingly:\n\n* Input shifted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, -3, -3, -3]\n\nStep 3: Merge the shifted objects and noise pixels together.\n\nAt this point, we merge the resulting shifted object back into the main sequence:\n\n* Merged: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHowever, it appears there has been some confusion while describing the problem. In Step 3, merging should happen before shifting; otherwise, the actual meaning of'shifting' gets distorted. If we follow the correct order, here is what we get:\n\nStep 3a: Merge the original unshifted objects and noise pixels.\n\n* After merging: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow apply the remaining two steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the first non-zero pixel index of each object in the merged input sequence.\n\n* First occurrence starts at index 5.\n\nStep 2: Shift the object towards the beginning of the sequence by subtracting the respective first non-zero pixel's index from all elements in the object.\n\n* Shifted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThe resulted sequence does not match the supposedly correct output presented earlier because those samples had errors in their 'Shift' process due to incorrect ordering of merging and shifting. To ensure fairness and consistency throughout, I suggest revisiting the transformation steps and updating them with the corrected order, i.e., Merge -> Shift. Following these corrected steps, the final shifted output for the given test input would be:\n\n{\n\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence: \\n\\n1.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n\ndescription: None\n\noverall pattern: None\n\ntransformation steps: ['1.

Shift each object towards the beginning of the sequence by subtracting the respective first non-zero pixel's index from all elements in the object.\", '3. Merge the shifted objects and noise pixels together.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: None\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Based on the provided information, we will evaluate the correctness of the transformation applied to the test input sequence. Let's go through the transformation steps one by one.\n\n1. Find the first non-zero pixel index of each object in the input sequence. For this test input, the first non-zero pixel index of the single object is 5 (starting at index 0).\n2. Shift each object towards the beginning of the sequence by subtracting the respective first non-zero pixel's index from all elements in the object. In our case, since the first non-zero index was 5, we subtract 5 from all elements having a value greater than zero:\n   New sequence: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSince there were no specific descriptions or patterns related to merging objects and noise pixels, I assume it means concatenating them directly. Thus, the final output based on the given transformation would look like this:\n\nPotential output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHowever, the actual test output provided is `None`. Since the expected output does not match the actual output, it indicates that the transformation was not applied correctly according to the given instructions.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n    'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.',\n    'value': 0\n}\n------\n Based on the provided transformation steps, I will evaluate the test case.\n\nStep 1: In the test input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], there is only one object (color 8) starting at index 5, so the first non-zero pixel index of this object is 5.\n\nStep 2: To shift the object towards the beginning of the sequence by subtracting the first non-zero pixel's index from all elements in the object, we get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n\nStep 3: Since after shifting, the object merged with the noise pixels, it seems like there is no change required anymore according to the description. So, let's keep the original input as our test output candidate.\n\nGiven the expected output value isn't available, I cannot provide a strict numerical evaluation based on input-output comparison. However, considering that the goal appears to be merging the objects and noise pixels together upon shifting them towards the beginning, the test input sequence does seem to match the requirements when compared to the result obtained using the given transformation steps. Thus, I would rate the test output consistency with the described transformation as 10 out of 10.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation algorithm steps, the test input sequence has been correctly transformed into its test output sequence - the original input sequence itself.', 'value': '10'}"
