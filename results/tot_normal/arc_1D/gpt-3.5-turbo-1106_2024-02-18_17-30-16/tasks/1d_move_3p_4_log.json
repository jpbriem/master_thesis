The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The transformation is solely dependent on the object's color and its movement in the input sequence.\noverall pattern: The objects with specific colors are moved to the right within the sequence. The transformation is consistent across all input-output pairs, where the color, position, and size of the object remain the same in the output.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence based on color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Select the objects that are to be moved to the right within the sequence.', 'For each selected object, shift its start index and end index to the right by the same number of positions.', 'Construct the output sequence based on the modified objects and the unchanged background pixels.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\noutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
