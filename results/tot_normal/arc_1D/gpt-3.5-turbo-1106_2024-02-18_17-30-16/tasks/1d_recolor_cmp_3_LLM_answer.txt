#############################Sample Prompt:
#####
system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Your task is to describe the objects in the given input and output sequences.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the input sequence.', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all objects in the output sequence.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input sequences.', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output sequences.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they fit to the examples and cover all relevant commonalities. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given input description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other inputs.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given output description fits to the example and covers all relevant commonalities with other outputs.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input sequence. Your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input sequence, detailing how each condition of the transformation pattern applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformed_objects': 'describe how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output sequence as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


You are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input sequence and a potential test output sequence.

Evaluate the given test output sequence and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input sequence. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation algorithm and analyze if the test input sequence was correctly transformed into its test output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
