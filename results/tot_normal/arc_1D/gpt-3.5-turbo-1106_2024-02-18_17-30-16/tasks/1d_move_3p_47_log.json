The transformation involves shifting and resizing the object while maintaining its color.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with descriptions, detailing similarities unique to inputs and outputs respectively.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output sequences of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.
