You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation can involve changes in the position of objects, alterations in their shape, or the introduction of new elements or colors.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation can involve changes in the position of objects, alterations in their shape, or the introduction of new elements or colors.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the color of the pixel and its adjacency to other colors or the grid edge. Color '3' pixels expand into adjacent '0' pixels. Color '2' pixels are overwritten by '3' if they are adjacent to expanding '3' pixels. The bottom half of the grid is always cleared.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves the expansion of color '3' objects into adjacent background spaces and overwriting color '2' objects where they touch. The bottom half of the grid is cleared to background color, regardless of the initial state.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation can involve changes in the position of objects, alterations in their shape, or the introduction of new elements or colors.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the color of the pixels and their adjacency to other colors or the grid edge. Color '3' pixels expand orthogonally into adjacent '0' pixels and overwrite '2' pixels when touching. The bottom rows are cleared if they do not contain expanding '3' pixels.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves the expansion of color '3' pixels into adjacent '0' spaces and overwriting '2' pixels where they touch, while maintaining the original '2' pixels that are not adjacent to '3'. The bottom rows are cleared of all pixels unless they are part of the expanding '3' object. This pattern is consistent across all examples.

overall pattern:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.
overall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of pixels of color '3' to pixels of color '2', and the vertical position of '3' pixels relative to the highest '2' pixels.
overall pattern: Color '3' pixels expand to replace adjacent color '2' pixels orthogonally. Color '2' pixels not adjacent to color '3' remain unchanged. Color '3' pixels below the highest row of color '2' pixels are removed, effectively truncating the object of color '3'.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.
overall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of pixels of color '3' to pixels of color '2', and the vertical position of '3' pixels relative to the highest '2' pixels.
overall pattern: Color '3' pixels expand to replace adjacent color '2' pixels orthogonally. Color '2' pixels not adjacent to color '3' remain unchanged. Color '3' pixels below the highest row of color '2' pixels are removed, effectively truncating the object of color '3'.



transformation steps: ["Identify the highest row (lowest index) that contains color '2' pixels.", "For each color '3' pixel, check if it is orthogonally adjacent to a color '2' pixel.", "If a color '3' pixel is adjacent to a color '2' pixel, replace the color '2' pixel with a color '3' pixel.", "Remove all color '3' pixels that are below the highest row of color '2' pixels.", "Leave all color '2' pixels that are not adjacent to color '3' pixels unchanged."]

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.
overall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.



transformation steps: ['Identify all color 3 pixels that are adjacent to color 2 pixels.', 'Replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels with color 3, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background.', 'Turn all color 3 pixels that are not adjacent to color 2 pixels into the background color (0).', 'The outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background remains unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.
overall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 3 pixels that are adjacent to color 2 pixels.', 'Replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels with color 3, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background.', 'Turn all color 3 pixels that are not adjacent to color 2 pixels into the background color (0).', 'The outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background remains unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.
overall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 3 pixels that are adjacent to color 2 pixels.', 'Replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels with color 3, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background.', 'Turn all color 3 pixels that are not adjacent to color 2 pixels into the background color (0).', 'The outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background remains unchanged.']

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.
overall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 3 pixels that are adjacent to color 2 pixels.', 'Replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels with color 3, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background.', 'Turn all color 3 pixels that are not adjacent to color 2 pixels into the background color (0).', 'The outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background remains unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:

overall pattern: Color '3' pixels expand to replace adjacent color '2' pixels orthogonally. Color '2' pixels not adjacent to color '3' remain unchanged. Color '3' pixels below the highest row of color '2' pixels are removed, effectively truncating the object of color '3'.


transformation steps: ["Identify the highest row (lowest index) that contains color '2' pixels.", "For each color '3' pixel, check if it is orthogonally adjacent to a color '2' pixel.", "If a color '3' pixel is adjacent to a color '2' pixel, replace the color '2' pixel with a color '3' pixel.", "Remove all color '3' pixels that are below the highest row of color '2' pixels.", "Leave all color '2' pixels that are not adjacent to color '3' pixels unchanged."]

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of pixels of color '3' to pixels of color '2', and the vertical position of '3' pixels relative to the highest '2' pixels.
overall pattern: Color '3' pixels expand to replace adjacent color '2' pixels orthogonally. Color '2' pixels not adjacent to color '3' remain unchanged. Color '3' pixels below the highest row of color '2' pixels are removed, effectively truncating the object of color '3'.


transformation steps: ["Identify the highest row (lowest index) that contains color '2' pixels.", "For each color '3' pixel, check if it is orthogonally adjacent to a color '2' pixel.", "If a color '3' pixel is adjacent to a color '2' pixel, replace the color '2' pixel with a color '3' pixel.", "Remove all color '3' pixels that are below the highest row of color '2' pixels.", "Leave all color '2' pixels that are not adjacent to color '3' pixels unchanged."]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, with colors represented by numbers from 1 to 9, and the background represented by 0. Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of pixels of color '3' to pixels of color '2', and the vertical position of '3' pixels relative to the highest '2' pixels.
overall pattern: Color '3' pixels expand to replace adjacent color '2' pixels orthogonally. Color '2' pixels not adjacent to color '3' remain unchanged. Color '3' pixels below the highest row of color '2' pixels are removed, effectively truncating the object of color '3'.


transformation steps: ["Identify the highest row (lowest index) that contains color '2' pixels.", "For each color '3' pixel, check if it is orthogonally adjacent to a color '2' pixel.", "If a color '3' pixel is adjacent to a color '2' pixel, replace the color '2' pixel with a color '3' pixel.", "Remove all color '3' pixels that are below the highest row of color '2' pixels.", "Leave all color '2' pixels that are not adjacent to color '3' pixels unchanged."]
