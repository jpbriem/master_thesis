You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation, where certain clusters or shapes have been moved, resized, or altered in some way while maintaining the overall structure and color integrity of the original input


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects of color 6. These objects move to the leftmost available position within the same row, replacing objects of color 2 if they occupy that space.
overall pattern: For each row in the input grid, if there is an object of color 6, it moves to the leftmost available position within the same row. If this position is occupied by an object of color 2, the color 6 object replaces it. No other objects or colors are affected by this transformation.

input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.


overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change is the presence of objects of color 6 that are not adjacent to objects of color 2. The objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to the nearest objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to be adjacent to the nearest objects of color 2. The movement is either to the left or upwards, whichever direction is needed to achieve adjacency without altering the size or shape of the objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects of a specific color. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to be adjacent to the nearest objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the left or upwards, to form a contiguous shape with the color 2 object. This is done by replacing the background color 0 with color 6 pixels.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change is the presence of objects of color 6 that are not adjacent to objects of color 2. The objects of color 6 move to the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to become adjacent to the nearest objects of color 2. The movement is either to the left or upwards, whichever direction is needed to achieve adjacency without altering the size or shape of the objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change is the presence of objects of color 6 that are not adjacent to objects of color 2. The objects of color 6 move to the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to become adjacent to the nearest objects of color 2. The movement is either to the left or upwards, whichever direction is needed to achieve adjacency without altering the size or shape of the objects.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 that are not adjacent to any object of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2.', 'Move each object of color 6 towards the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2 by shifting it left or upwards, whichever direction is shorter, until it becomes adjacent.', 'Ensure that the size and shape of the object of color 6 remain unchanged during the movement.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 that meet the condition.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 and their respective nearest objects of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2, considering both the leftmost and uppermost edges.', 'Calculate the minimum distance required to move the object of color 6 to become adjacent to the object of color 2 without changing its shape or size.', 'Move the object of color 6 to the determined edge of the object of color 2, ensuring that it becomes directly adjacent to the object of color 2.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 in the grid.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not alter the size or shape of any objects and that objects of color 6 do not overlap with objects of color 2 or with each other.']

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 and their respective nearest objects of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2, considering both the leftmost and uppermost edges.', 'Calculate the minimum distance required to move the object of color 6 to the nearest edge of the object of color 2 without changing its shape or size.', 'Move the object of color 6 to the determined edge of the object of color 2, ensuring that it becomes adjacent to the object of color 2.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 in the grid.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not alter the size or shape of any objects and that objects of color 6 do not overlap with objects of color 2 or with each other.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 and their respective nearest objects of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2, considering both the leftmost and uppermost edges.', 'Calculate the minimum distance required to move the object of color 6 to become adjacent to the object of color 2 without changing its shape or size.', 'Move the object of color 6 to the determined edge of the object of color 2, ensuring that it becomes directly adjacent to the object of color 2.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 in the grid.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not alter the size or shape of any objects and that objects of color 6 do not overlap with objects of color 2 or with each other.']

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 and their respective nearest objects of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2, considering both the leftmost and uppermost edges.', 'Calculate the minimum distance required to move the object of color 6 to become adjacent to the object of color 2 without changing its shape or size.', 'Move the object of color 6 to the determined edge of the object of color 2, ensuring that it becomes directly adjacent to the object of color 2.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 in the grid.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not alter the size or shape of any objects and that objects of color 6 do not overlap with objects of color 2 or with each other.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 and their respective nearest objects of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2, considering both the leftmost and uppermost edges.', 'Calculate the minimum distance required to move the object of color 6 to become adjacent to the object of color 2 without changing its shape or size.', 'Move the object of color 6 to the determined edge of the object of color 2, ensuring that it becomes directly adjacent to the object of color 2.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 in the grid.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not alter the size or shape of any objects and that objects of color 6 do not overlap with objects of color 2 or with each other.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form contiguous shapes or objects, often with clear boundaries and sometimes with isolated pixels or smaller groups of pixels of the same color, which may represent noise or smaller objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific rule, which may involve moving certain pixels or groups of pixels to new locations, altering the shapes of objects, or changing the arrangement of colors within the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the adjacency of objects with different colors. Specifically, objects of color 6 move to become adjacent to objects of color 2.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving objects of color 6 to the nearest edge of objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. This is done without altering the size or shape of the objects, and the movement is such that it minimizes the distance between the objects of color 6 and color 2.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of color 6 and their respective nearest objects of color 2.', 'For each object of color 6, determine the nearest edge of the nearest object of color 2, considering both the leftmost and uppermost edges.', 'Calculate the minimum distance required to move the object of color 6 to the nearest edge of the object of color 2 without changing its shape or size.', 'Move the object of color 6 to the determined edge of the object of color 2, ensuring that it becomes adjacent to the object of color 2.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of color 6 in the grid.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not alter the size or shape of any objects and that objects of color 6 do not overlap with objects of color 2 or with each other.']

Value Outputs:

  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid does not seem to follow the transformation steps correctly. The objects of color 6 should move to the nearest edge of the objects of color 2, either to the leftmost or the uppermost edge, depending on which is closer. However, in the test output, the objects of color 6 have been moved to the rightmost edge of the objects of color 2, which is not consistent with the described transformation pattern. Additionally, the objects of color 6 should become adjacent to the objects of color 2 without changing their shape or size, but in the test output, the objects of color 6 have been stretched horizontally to fill the entire row, which alters their original shape and size. This indicates that the transformation steps were not applied correctly.",
