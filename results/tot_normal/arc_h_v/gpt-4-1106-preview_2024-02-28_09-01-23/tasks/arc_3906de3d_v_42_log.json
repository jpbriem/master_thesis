The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the given input and output grids.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: \"A typical input grid shows pixels that...\"', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: \"A typical output grid shows pixels that...\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

These shapes can have irregular boundaries and may contain holes represented by background pixels. There may also be separate smaller shapes or isolated pixels of a different color.\noutput: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation where certain colors have been moved or expanded into adjacent areas, often filling in the holes within the larger shapes. The transformation appears to be consistent across examples, suggesting a rule-based pattern affecting the position and spread of colors.\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation is conditional upon the color of the pixel and its position relative to other colors. The '6' color expands into adjacent background pixels, but only within the boundary of the '9' color shape.\noverall pattern: The consistent pattern across all examples is that the '6' color expands orthogonally to fill in the background spaces within the '9' color shape, but does not replace any '9' pixels. The '9' shape acts as a container that limits the expansion of the '6' color. This expansion occurs until there are no more adjacent background pixels within the '9' shape or until the '6' color reaches the edge of the '9' shape.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions refer to the input and are relevant for determining the changes.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

These shapes can have varying sizes and configurations, and are often surrounded by background pixels represented by the value 0.\noutput: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other colored pixels, often resulting in a change in the shape or position of the original colored areas. The transformation appears to follow a specific pattern or rule that affects the arrangement of the pixels.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation occurs when an object of color 6 is directly below an object of color 9. The top row of the color 6 object moves up to replace the bottom row of the color 9 object directly above it.\noverall pattern: The input-output relationship involves the upward movement of color 6 pixels, replacing the bottom row of color 9 pixels directly above them. This transformation continues until there are no more color 9 pixels directly above the color 6 pixels, or until the color 6 pixels reach the top of the grid.\n\n\ntransformation steps: To transform a given input grid into its output grid, follow these steps: 1. Identify objects of color 9 and color 6. 2. Check if there is an object of color 6 directly below an object of color 9. 3. If so, move the top row of the color 6 object upwards to replace the bottom row of the color 9 object directly above it. 4. Repeat this process for each row of the color 6 object until there are no more color 9 pixels directly above or until the color 6 pixels reach the top of the grid. 5. Apply this transformation across the entire grid to achieve the final output.\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"The test input grid is a 10x10 grid with two objects.

These shapes can have varying sizes and configurations, and are often surrounded by background pixels represented by the value 0.\noutput: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other colored pixels, often resulting in a change in the shape or position of the original colored areas. The transformation appears to follow a specific pattern or rule that affects the arrangement of the pixels.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation occurs when an object of color 6 is directly below an object of color 9. The top row of the color 6 object moves up to replace the bottom row of the color 9 object directly above it.\noverall pattern: The input-output relationship involves the upward movement of color 6 pixels, replacing the bottom row of color 9 pixels directly above them. This transformation continues until there are no more color 9 pixels directly above the color 6 pixels, or until the color 6 pixels reach the top of the grid.\n\n\ntransformation steps: To transform a given input grid into its output grid, follow these steps: 1. Identify objects of color 9 and color 6. 2. Check if there is an object of color 6 directly below an object of color 9. 3. If so, move the top row of the color 6 object upwards to replace the bottom row of the color 9 object directly above it. 4. Repeat this process for each row of the color 6 object until there are no more color 9 pixels directly above or until the color 6 pixels reach the top of the grid. 5.
