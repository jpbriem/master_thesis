You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the proximity and relative position of color 7 pixels to color 3 pixels. The movement of color 7 pixels is conditional upon encountering the grid boundary or another color 7 pixel.
overall pattern: Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and left until they cannot move further due to the grid boundary or another color 7 pixel. When a color 7 pixel moves, it displaces a color 3 pixel to its immediate right if present. This pattern is consistent across all examples, indicating a rule where color 7 seeks to move towards the top-left corner, and color 3 yields its position to color 7, moving to the right.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and position relative to other objects. Color 7 pixels move diagonally until they encounter the boundary of color 3 or the grid edge.
overall pattern: Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, creating a diagonal line within the confines of the color 3 object or until they reach the grid boundary. The movement stops when a color 7 pixel would overlap with a color 3 pixel or when it reaches the grid edge. The color 3 object acts as a barrier that color 7 cannot cross, and it remains unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right. The movement stops when a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid. Color 3 pixels are overwritten by color 7 if they collide.
overall pattern: Identify all pixels of color 7. Move each pixel diagonally up and to the right by one position. If a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid, it stops moving. If a color 7 pixel lands on a color 3 pixel, the color 3 pixel changes to color 7.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern: Identify all pixels of color 7. Move each pixel diagonally up and to the right by one position. If a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid, it stops moving. If a color 7 pixel lands on a color 3 pixel, the color 3 pixel changes to color 7.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.



transformation steps: ['Identify all color 7 pixels in the grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, check if the position diagonally up and to the right is empty (has a value of 0).', 'If the position is empty, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat step 2 and 3 until the color 7 pixel cannot move further.', 'For each new position of a color 7 pixel, change any adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7.', 'Continue the process until all color 7 pixels have moved to their final positions and all adjacent color 3 pixels have been transformed.']

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.



transformation steps: ['Identify all color 7 pixels in the grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, check if the diagonal position up and to the right is empty (has a value of 0).', 'If the diagonal position is empty, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat the diagonal movement for each color 7 pixel until no further movement is possible.', 'For each new position of a color 7 pixel, check for adjacent color 3 pixels (up, down, left, right).', 'Change any adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7.', 'Continue the process until all color 7 pixels have moved as far as possible and all adjacent color 3 pixels have been converted to color 7.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right. The movement stops when a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid. Color 3 pixels are overwritten by color 7 if they collide.
overall pattern: Identify all pixels of color 7. Move each pixel diagonally up and to the right by one position. If a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid, it stops moving. If a color 7 pixel lands on a color 3 pixel, the color 3 pixel changes to color 7.


transformation steps: ['Identify all pixels of color 7 in the input grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, calculate its new position by moving it diagonally up and to the right (i.e., decrement the row index and increment the column index).', 'Check if the new position is within the bounds of the grid. If it is not, the pixel remains in its last valid position.', 'If the new position is occupied by a color 3 pixel, overwrite it with color 7.', 'If the new position is unoccupied or occupied by a color 7 pixel, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat the process for all color 7 pixels until all have been moved or stopped.', 'Output the transformed grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 7 pixels in the grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, check if the diagonal position up and to the right is empty (has a value of 0).', 'If the diagonal position is empty, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat the diagonal movement for each color 7 pixel until no further movement is possible.', 'For each new position of a color 7 pixel, check for adjacent color 3 pixels (up, down, left, right).', 'Change any adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7.', 'Continue the process until all color 7 pixels have moved as far as possible and all adjacent color 3 pixels have been converted to color 7.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right. The movement stops when a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid. Color 3 pixels are overwritten by color 7 if they collide.
overall pattern: Identify all pixels of color 7. Move each pixel diagonally up and to the right by one position. If a color 7 pixel encounters a color 3 pixel or the edge of the grid, it stops moving. If a color 7 pixel lands on a color 3 pixel, the color 3 pixel changes to color 7.


transformation steps: ['Identify all pixels of color 7 in the input grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, calculate its new position by moving it diagonally up and to the right (i.e., decrement the row index and increment the column index).', 'Check if the new position is within the bounds of the grid. If it is not, the pixel remains in its last valid position.', 'If the new position is occupied by a color 3 pixel, overwrite it with color 7.', 'If the new position is unoccupied or occupied by a color 7 pixel, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat the process for all color 7 pixels until all have been moved or stopped.', 'Output the transformed grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 7 pixels in the grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, check if the diagonal position up and to the right is empty (has a value of 0).', 'If the diagonal position is empty, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat the diagonal movement for each color 7 pixel until no further movement is possible.', 'For each new position of a color 7 pixel, check for adjacent color 3 pixels (up, down, left, right).', 'Change any adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7.', 'Continue the process until all color 7 pixels have moved as far as possible and all adjacent color 3 pixels have been converted to color 7.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]]

output: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form objects with distinct colors, where each object is composed of adjacent pixels of the same color. The objects can have various shapes and sizes, and they are separated by background pixels with a value of 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have undergone a transformation based on their proximity to other objects or the edges of the grid. The transformation may involve changing the color of certain pixels, often to match or contrast with neighboring objects, while maintaining the overall structure of the original objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on their color and proximity to other objects or the grid's edge. Color 7 pixels move diagonally up and to the right, and color 3 pixels change to color 7 when adjacent to moving color 7 pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation involves color 7 pixels moving diagonally until they cannot move further due to the grid's edge or another object. As they move, they convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7, effectively merging with color 3 objects in their path. The pattern is consistent across all examples, with the movement and merging being the key aspects of the transformation.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 7 pixels in the grid.', 'For each color 7 pixel, check if the diagonal position up and to the right is empty (has a value of 0).', 'If the diagonal position is empty, move the color 7 pixel to that position.', 'Repeat the diagonal movement for each color 7 pixel until no further movement is possible.', 'For each new position of a color 7 pixel, check for adjacent color 3 pixels (up, down, left, right).', 'Change any adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7.', 'Continue the process until all color 7 pixels have moved as far as possible and all adjacent color 3 pixels have been converted to color 7.']

input: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]]

output: [[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Value Outputs:

The color 7 pixels are supposed to move diagonally up and to the right, and as they move, they should convert adjacent color 3 pixels to color 7. However, in the test output grid, some color 7 pixels have not moved correctly, and some color 3 pixels that should have been converted to color 7 remain unchanged. For example, the color 7 pixel at [9,1] should have moved to [8,2], and the color 7 pixel at [8,2] should have moved to [7,3], converting the color 3 pixel at [7,3] to color 7. Similarly, the color 7 pixel at [7,8] should have moved to [6,9], but it remains in its original position. Additionally, the color 7 pixel at [6,8] should have moved to [5,9], but it also remains in its original position. The color 3 pixels at [5,5] and [6,4] should have been converted to color 7 due to their adjacency to the color 7 pixel that moved from [7,6] to [6,7].
