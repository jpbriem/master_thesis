The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the given input and output grids.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: \"A typical input grid shows pixels that...\"', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: \"A typical output grid shows pixels that...\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.\noutput: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.\noverall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer to the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels, which is relevant for determining the changes in the output grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output, as color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides clear rules for the expansion of color 3 pixels and the preservation of the outermost layer of color 2 pixels.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are consistent with the observed transformation, focusing on the adjacency of color 3 to color 2 pixels and the preservation of the outermost layer of color 2 pixels.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation, as we see color 3 pixels expanding and replacing color 2 pixels, while the outermost layer of color 2 pixels remains unchanged.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, providing a clear method for determining which color 2 pixels are replaced by color 3 and which are preserved.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are relevant as they focus on the interaction between color 3 and color 2 pixels, which is the basis for the transformation.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is accurate in describing the transformation, with color 3 pixels expanding to replace color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer adjacent to the background.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, as it allows for the prediction of the output grid based on the specified adjacency and replacement rules.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer to the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels, which is relevant for determining the changes in the output grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output, as color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides clear rules for the expansion of color 3 pixels and the preservation of the outermost layer of color 2 pixels.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are consistent with the observed transformation, focusing on the adjacency of color 3 to color 2 pixels and the preservation of the outermost layer of color 2 pixels.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation, as we see color 3 pixels expanding and replacing color 2 pixels, while the outermost layer of color 2 pixels remains unchanged.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, providing a clear method for determining which color 2 pixels are replaced by color 3 and which are preserved.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are relevant as they focus on the interaction between color 3 and color 2 pixels, which is the basis for the transformation.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is accurate in describing the transformation, with color 3 pixels expanding to replace color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer adjacent to the background.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise, as it allows for the prediction of the output grid based on the specified adjacency and replacement rules.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}"

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.\noverall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all color 3 pixels that are adjacent to color 2 pixels.', 'Replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels with color 3, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background.', 'Turn all color 3 pixels that are not adjacent to color 2 pixels into the background color (0).', 'The outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background remains unchanged.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"transformation_analysis\": \"The transformation steps correctly identify and replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background.

Objects are defined by adjacent pixels of the same color, and they can vary in shape and size.\noutput: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed based on their adjacency to other colors or the background, with some objects potentially changing in color, position, or being removed entirely. The transformation rules applied to the objects seem to be consistent across examples.\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation is conditional on the adjacency of color 3 pixels to color 2 pixels. Color 3 pixels expand to replace color 2 pixels they are adjacent to, but do not replace the outermost layer of color 2 pixels adjacent to the background. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels turn into the background.\noverall pattern: Color 3 pixels expand orthogonally to replace adjacent color 2 pixels, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels which remain unchanged. Color 3 pixels not adjacent to color 2 pixels are turned into the background. This results in a 'frame' of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background being preserved while the interior is replaced by color 3.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all color 3 pixels that are adjacent to color 2 pixels.', 'Replace color 2 pixels that are adjacent to color 3 pixels with color 3, except for the outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background.', 'Turn all color 3 pixels that are not adjacent to color 2 pixels into the background color (0).', 'The outermost layer of color 2 pixels that are adjacent to the background remains unchanged.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"input_description\": \"The test input grid is a 10x10 grid with two objects.
