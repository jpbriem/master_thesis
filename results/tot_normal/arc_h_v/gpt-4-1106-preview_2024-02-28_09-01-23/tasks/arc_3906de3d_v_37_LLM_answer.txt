You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the presence of color 6 pixels. These pixels expand orthogonally and replace adjacent color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows are cleared based on the highest row where color 6 is present.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 become color 6. Rows below the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This pattern applies to all examples, with the specific number of bottom rows cleared depending on the highest occurrence of color 6.

The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is triggered by the presence of color 6 pixels in the bottom-left corner. The spread of color 6 pixels diagonally replaces the background color 0 and stops when encountering a vertical or horizontal line of color 9 pixels.
overall pattern: Starting from the bottom-left corner, color 6 pixels spread diagonally upwards to the right, replacing background color 0 and some color 9 pixels. The spread of color 6 is halted by vertical or horizontal lines of color 9, effectively trimming the edges of the color 9 object. This results in a new arrangement where color 6 objects appear along the trimmed edges of the color 9 object.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is influenced by the presence of color 6 pixels. When a pixel of color 6 is found, it spreads diagonally upwards to the right, replacing background pixels and some color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels are removed from the bottom half of the grid, except for a single column that remains unchanged.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves the diagonal spread of color 6 pixels, which expand to form a diagonal line that replaces certain pixels. Color 9 objects are reduced in size by removing pixels from the bottom and right edges, except for a single column that remains intact. This pattern is consistent across all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the presence of color 6 pixels. These pixels expand orthogonally and replace adjacent color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows are cleared based on the highest row where color 6 is present.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 become color 6. Rows below the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This pattern applies to all examples, with the specific number of bottom rows cleared depending on the highest occurrence of color 6.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.



transformation steps: To transform a given input grid into its output grid, follow these steps: 1. Identify all color 6 pixels in the grid. 2. For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) and replace any adjacent color 9 pixels with color 6. The expansion stops at color 0 or the grid's edge. 3. Count the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start. 4. Clear the bottom rows of the grid to color 0, with the number of cleared rows equal to the count from step 3. 5. The resulting grid after these transformations is the output grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.



transformation steps: ['Identify all color 6 pixels in the input grid.', "For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to replace adjacent color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at color 0 or the grid's edge.", 'Count the number of rows from the bottom that contain color 6 pixels at the start.', 'Clear the same number of bottom rows to color 0 as the count obtained in the previous step.', 'The resulting grid after these steps is the output grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the presence of color 6 pixels. These pixels expand orthogonally and replace adjacent color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows are cleared based on the highest row where color 6 is present.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 become color 6. Rows below the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This pattern applies to all examples, with the specific number of bottom rows cleared depending on the highest occurrence of color 6.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional on the presence of color 6 pixels. These pixels expand orthogonally and replace adjacent color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows are cleared based on the highest row where color 6 is present.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 become color 6. Rows below the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This pattern applies to all examples, with the specific number of bottom rows cleared depending on the highest occurrence of color 6.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.


transformation steps: To transform a given input grid into its output grid, follow these steps: 1. Identify all color 6 pixels in the grid. 2. For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) and replace any adjacent color 9 pixels with color 6. The expansion stops at color 0 or the grid's edge. 3. Count the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start. 4. Clear the bottom rows of the grid to color 0, with the number of cleared rows equal to the count from step 3. 5. The resulting grid after these transformations is the output grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 6 pixels in the input grid.', "For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to replace adjacent color 9 pixels.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.


transformation steps: To transform a given input grid into its output grid, follow these steps: 1. Identify all color 6 pixels in the grid. 2. For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) and replace any adjacent color 9 pixels with color 6. The expansion stops at color 0 or the grid's edge. 3. Count the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start. 4. Clear the bottom rows of the grid to color 0, with the number of cleared rows equal to the count from step 3. 5. The resulting grid after these transformations is the output grid.


Test case:
input: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.


transformation steps: To transform a given input grid into its output grid, follow these steps: 1. Identify all color 6 pixels in the grid. 2. For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) and replace any adjacent color 9 pixels with color 6. The expansion stops at color 0 or the grid's edge. 3. Count the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start. 4. Clear the bottom rows of the grid to color 0, with the number of cleared rows equal to the count from step 3. 5. The resulting grid after these transformations is the output grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form various shapes and patterns, with some pixels forming contiguous blocks of color representing objects, while others are isolated or form smaller groups. The colors of the pixels may vary, and the background is typically represented by the color 0.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have been transformed according to a specific pattern or rule, which may involve changing the positions of certain pixels, altering their colors, or both. The transformation often results in a new arrangement of the objects within the grid, with some objects potentially being removed or merged.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is based on the expansion of color 6 pixels orthogonally, which replace color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at the grid's edge or at color 0. The bottom rows of the grid are cleared to color 0, with the number of cleared rows corresponding to the number of rows that contain color 6 pixels at the start.
overall pattern: Color 6 pixels expand orthogonally, replacing color 9 pixels. Color 9 pixels adjacent to color 6 pixels also change to color 6. The bottom rows up to the highest row containing color 6 are cleared to color 0. This results in a reduction of the size of color 9 objects and an increase in the size of color 6 objects, with the grid's lower part being cleared.


transformation steps: ['Identify all color 6 pixels in the input grid.', "For each color 6 pixel, expand it orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to replace adjacent color 9 pixels. The expansion stops at color 0 or the grid's edge.", 'Count the number of rows from the bottom that contain color 6 pixels at the start.', 'Clear the same number of bottom rows to color 0 as the count obtained in the previous step.', 'The resulting grid after these steps is the output grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
