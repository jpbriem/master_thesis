You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the position of gaps within the large object and the position and size of the smaller object. The color of the smaller object is used to fill in the gaps of the larger object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill in the gaps of the larger object. The smaller object's pixels are used to fill the nearest gaps in the larger object vertically above them, and any remaining pixels of the smaller object are removed. The larger object becomes a complete rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or eliminated.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of a smaller object of a different color below it.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object directly above them. If the smaller object's pixels are not enough to fill all gaps, they start from the lowest gap and move upwards sequentially. Any remaining pixels of the smaller object that are not used to fill gaps are removed from the grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs when there are gaps within a large object of one color, and there are smaller objects of a different color below the large object. The smaller objects move upwards to fill the gaps in the large object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves filling gaps within large objects with pixels from smaller objects located below them. The smaller objects move upwards until they fill a gap or reach the edge of the large object. Any remaining pixels of the smaller objects are removed.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of smaller objects of a different color below the large object. The smaller objects move upwards to fill the gaps in the large object.
overall pattern: Identify the largest object with gaps and the smaller objects below it. Move the pixels of the smaller objects upwards to fill the gaps in the largest object. If there are excess pixels from the smaller objects after filling the gaps, remove them. The large object becomes a complete rectangle, and the smaller objects are either reduced in size or completely removed.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the sides of the large objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change based on the presence of gaps within the larger object and the position of the smaller object. The smaller object's pixels move to fill the gaps in the larger object.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving pixels of the smaller object (color 6) upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object (color 2). If there are more pixels of color 6 than needed to fill the gaps, the excess pixels are removed. The larger object becomes a solid rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or eliminated.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the sides of the large objects.


overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of smaller objects of a different color below the large object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object color upwards to fill gaps in the large object. If there are more small object pixels than gaps, the excess pixels are removed. The large object becomes a filled rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of a smaller object of a different color below it.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object directly above them. If the smaller object's pixels are not enough to fill all gaps, they start from the lowest gap and move upwards sequentially. Any remaining pixels of the smaller object that are not used to fill gaps are removed from the grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the sides of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of smaller objects of a different color below the large object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object color upwards to fill gaps in the large object. If there are more small object pixels than gaps, the excess pixels are removed. The large object becomes a filled rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed.

output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of a smaller object of a different color below it.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object directly above them. If the smaller object's pixels are not enough to fill all gaps, they start from the lowest gap and move upwards sequentially. Any remaining pixels of the smaller object that are not used to fill gaps are removed from the grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of a smaller object of a different color below it.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object directly above them. If the smaller object's pixels are not enough to fill all gaps, they start from the lowest gap and move upwards sequentially. Any remaining pixels of the smaller object that are not used to fill gaps are removed from the grid.



transformation steps: ['Identify the large object with gaps and the color of the object.', 'Locate the smaller object of a different color positioned below the large object.', 'For each gap in the large object, starting from the lowest gap, move a pixel from the smaller object directly below it upwards to fill the gap.', 'Continue this process until all gaps are filled or there are no more pixels in the smaller object.', 'If there are any remaining pixels in the smaller object after filling the gaps, remove them from the grid.', 'The output grid should now display the large object with previously missing sections filled in and no remaining pixels of the smaller object unless they were used to fill gaps.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the sides of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of smaller objects of a different color below the large object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object color upwards to fill gaps in the large object. If there are more small object pixels than gaps, the excess pixels are removed. The large object becomes a filled rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed.



transformation steps: ['Identify the large object and its color within the grid.', 'Locate gaps within the large object that need to be filled.', 'Identify the smaller object(s) of a different color located below the large object.', 'Move pixels from the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the large object. This should be done in a way that the smaller object pixels directly below the gaps are moved first.', 'If there are more small object pixels than gaps, remove the excess pixels from the grid.', 'Ensure that the large object becomes a filled rectangle with no gaps.', 'The smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed, depending on the number of gaps filled.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of a smaller object of a different color below it.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object directly above them. If the smaller object's pixels are not enough to fill all gaps, they start from the lowest gap and move upwards sequentially. Any remaining pixels of the smaller object that are not used to fill gaps are removed from the grid.


transformation steps: ['Identify the large object with gaps and the color of the object.', 'Locate the smaller object of a different color positioned below the large object.', 'For each gap in the large object, starting from the lowest gap, move a pixel from the smaller object directly below it upwards to fill the gap.', 'Continue this process until all gaps are filled or there are no more pixels in the smaller object.', 'If there are any remaining pixels in the smaller object after filling the gaps, remove them from the grid.', 'The output grid should now display the large object with previously missing sections filled in and no remaining pixels of the smaller object unless they were used to fill gaps.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the sides of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of smaller objects of a different color below the large object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object color upwards to fill gaps in the large object. If there are more small object pixels than gaps, the excess pixels are removed. The large object becomes a filled rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed.


transformation steps: ['Identify the large object and its color within the grid.', 'Locate gaps within the large object that need to be filled.', 'Identify the smaller object(s) of a different color located below the large object.', 'Move pixels from the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the large object. This should be done in a way that the smaller object pixels directly below the gaps are moved first.', 'If there are more small object pixels than gaps, remove the excess pixels from the grid.', 'Ensure that the large object becomes a filled rectangle with no gaps.', 'The smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed, depending on the number of gaps filled.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the edges of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of a smaller object of a different color below it.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the larger object directly above them. If the smaller object's pixels are not enough to fill all gaps, they start from the lowest gap and move upwards sequentially. Any remaining pixels of the smaller object that are not used to fill gaps are removed from the grid.


transformation steps: ['Identify the large object with gaps and the color of the object.', 'Locate the smaller object of a different color positioned below the large object.', 'For each gap in the large object, starting from the lowest gap, move a pixel from the smaller object directly below it upwards to fill the gap.', 'Continue this process until all gaps are filled or there are no more pixels in the smaller object.', 'If there are any remaining pixels in the smaller object after filling the gaps, remove them from the grid.', 'The output grid should now display the large object with previously missing sections filled in and no remaining pixels of the smaller object unless they were used to fill gaps.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form large objects with missing sections and smaller objects located below the large objects.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that have the large objects filled in where sections were missing, with the smaller objects moved to fill in the gaps and sometimes appearing on the sides of the large objects.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs based on the presence of gaps within the large object of a single color and the presence of smaller objects of a different color below the large object.
overall pattern: The input-output relationship involves moving pixels of the smaller object color upwards to fill gaps in the large object. If there are more small object pixels than gaps, the excess pixels are removed. The large object becomes a filled rectangle, and the smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed.


transformation steps: ['Identify the large object and its color within the grid.', 'Locate gaps within the large object that need to be filled.', 'Identify the smaller object(s) of a different color located below the large object.', 'Move pixels from the smaller object upwards to fill the gaps in the large object. This should be done in a way that the smaller object pixels directly below the gaps are moved first.', 'If there are more small object pixels than gaps, remove the excess pixels from the grid.', 'Ensure that the large object becomes a filled rectangle with no gaps.', 'The smaller object is either reduced in size or completely removed, depending on the number of gaps filled.']

Value Outputs:

  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid does not correctly reflect the transformation steps. The large object, which is color '2', has gaps that should be filled by moving pixels from the smaller object, color '6', upwards. However, the output shows that not all gaps were filled, as there is still a gap in the second row, third column from the right. Additionally, the smaller object pixels have been moved upwards inconsistently, as there are still pixels of color '6' remaining in the fourth row, which should have been moved up to fill the gap in the large object. Furthermore, the output grid has an extra row of color '6' pixels at the bottom that should not be there according to the transformation steps. The large object should become a filled rectangle, but it remains with gaps, and the smaller object should be reduced or removed, which has not been fully achieved.",
