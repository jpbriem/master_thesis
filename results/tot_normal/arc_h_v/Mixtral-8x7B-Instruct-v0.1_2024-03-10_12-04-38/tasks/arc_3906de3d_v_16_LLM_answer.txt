#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Evaluate the given descriptions and analyze if they correctly describe all objects. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'input_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the input grid.', 'output_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given description correctly cover all objects and pixel pattern in the output grid', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given descriptions as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

description:
input: A typical input grid demonstrates various configurations of colored pixels arranged in different geometric shapes such as lines, triangles, squares, or more complex arrangements. These shapes may touch each other or appear isolated throughout the grid space.
output: A typical output grid generally manifests simpler configurations compared to inputs, often displaying symmetrical distributions of colors. Distinct areas of colors tend to merge together, creating enlarged uniformly colored sections or occasionally entirely new patterns unrelated to those observed in the input grids.

Value Outputs:
 Here is the JSON response for the three examples provided:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "input_analysis": "The given description covers some aspects of the input grid but misses others. While it's true that the input shows various geometric shapes (horizontal and vertical lines), it fails to mention specific details about how these shapes interact with each other, i.e., the overlapping section of two shapes becomes red when connected. Also, the term 'configurations' is too broad without further clarification.",
    "output_analysis": "The given description mostly fits here since the output indeed has simpler configurations than the input. However, it does not emphasize the symmetrical distribution of colors around the central red square, nor the merging of distinctively colored areas. It also lacks specificity in describing the new patterns formed in the output grid.",
    "value": "7"
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "input_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, this description captures some elements of the input grid but leaves out important ones. Although there are multiple shapes present, their interaction is not adequately described - specifically, how the blue triangle connects with other shapes changes its color to purple. Additionally, the phrase 'different geometric shapes' doesn't convey enough information about what types of shapes to expect.",
    "output_analysis": "This description again matches the general trend of the output grid becoming simpler than the input. However, it overlooks key features such as the rotation and mirroring symmetry of the output grid along both axes and the presence of a large purple X-shaped structure derived from the original shapes.",
    "value": "6"
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "input_analysis": "The description partially applies here too, discussing the existence of various shapes, yet failing to explain their interactions clearly. Specifically, when the pink shape touches another color, it turns yellow; however, this nuance is missing from the description.",
    "output_analysis": "While the description mentions merged areas in the output grid, it does not highlight the precise arrangement of colors resulting from these merges. In particular, the formation of an H-like structure made of pink, green, and yellow parts is not mentioned.",
    "value": "6"
  }
}
```

These ratings range from 6 to 7 because although the descriptions capture certain aspects of the problem, they lack detailed explanations regarding specific interactions among shapes and colors, as well as neglecting notable features of both input and output grids.

 Here is the JSON response you requested:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "input_analysis": "The given description covers some aspects of the input grid but fails to mention specific objects or pixel patterns accurately. For instance, it does not identify the distinct shape (a cross) formed by the color 6 that connects to the main object (the large square of color 2).",
    "output_analysis": "The given description captures some features of the output grid, like merging of colors and formation of larger uniformly colored sections. However, it does not specify how certain parts of the original shape (cross of color 6) completely disappear in the output, while others persist.",
    "value": "5"
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "input_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, this description lacks sufficient detail about the objects present in the input grid. It mentions geometric shapes like lines and squares, but overlooks the interconnection of these shapes and their position relative to the main shape (square of color 2).",
    "output_analysis": "This description for the output vaguely explains the concept of simple configuration and merged colors but misses crucial points. The output has an enclosed 'L' shaped region composed of color 6 that remains consistent through the operation, unlike mentioned in the description.",

  "Example_3": {
    "input_analysis": "The description continues to fall short when trying to capture precise information about the input grid. In particular, it neglects the unique properties of the two distinct regions formed - a ring around the big rectangle and another smaller one near the bottom left corner.",
    "output_analysis": "Although there is a symmetry-based simplification in the output, the description incorrectly suggests complete disappearance of certain parts of the original shapes, whereas here, the small ring (of color 6) still exists.",
    "value": "4"

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form continuous or disconnected regions consisting of identical numbers (excluding zeros). These regions may vary in size and shape.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either retain their original state or get replaced by certain predefined patterns depending upon some rule or condition.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels with value 6 trigger changes in the output grid based on connectivity requirements – if there are less than two horizontally or vertically connected neighboring pixels with value 6, no replacements occur.
overall pattern: Replace pixels with value 6 with value 2 if there are at least two horizontally or vertically connected neighbors having the same initial value, otherwise preserve the original value.

Value Outputs:
 Here is the JSON object containing the requested analysis for each of the three examples:

```json
{
   "Example_1": {
      "conditions_analysis": "The provided conditions for Example_1 do not explicitly refer to the input and seem irrelevant for determining the required changes. For instance, they mention nothing about the role of value 6 or how it relates to other values.",
      "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern seems to accurately describe the transformation from input to output for this example. However, the pattern does not clearly define what constitutes horizontal or vertical connectivity, leading to potential ambiguity when applying the rules.",
      "precision_analysis": "The precision of the overall pattern is moderate due to unclear definitions of connectivity and lack of specificity about applying the replacement rule only to pixels with value 6.",
      "value": 6
   },
   "Example_2": {
      "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the conditions are too general and don't address any properties specifically related to the input. They should include key aspects such as the importance of connecting pixels with value 6 and the requirement for a minimum number of connections before replacing.",
      "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern provides a reasonable description of the relationship between the input and output, although the definition of connectivity remains vague. There is also room for improvement in specifying exactly which pixels will undergo change.",
      "precision_analysis": "As in previous cases, the imprecise description of connectivity prevents the pattern from being easily applicable to new inputs, thus deducting points from the precision score.",
      "value": 7
   },
   "Example_3": {
      "conditions_analysis": "Likewise, the given conditions remain overly generic and fail to point out important features like the significance of specific pixel values involved in the transformation.",
      "overall_pattern_analysis": "Despite lacking clear instructions on pixel value comparisons, the overall pattern successfully captures the essence of the relationship between input and output in this particular case.",
      "precision_analysis": "As noted earlier, the ambiguity surrounding connectivity results in reduced precision and limits applicability to previously unseen inputs. Additionally, the absence of explicit reference to value 6 makes it challenging to apply this pattern reliably.",
      "value": 6
   }
}
```
In summary, while the overall pattern generally describes the relationship between the input and output, it falls short on precision due to insufficient clarity around what constitutes pixel value comparison and connectivity rules. This issue impacts the application of these rules to novel inputs, making them harder to implement effectively.
------
 Here's the JSON object containing the analysis for each example:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes. The condition about connectivity requirement is explicitly stated and used for replacing pixels.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output accurately. It captures the replacement of pixels with value 6 when they have at least two horizontally or vertically connected neighbors with the same initial value.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern appears to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output since the conditions for replacement are well defined.",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "As before, the conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes. The emphasis on connectivity remains crucial for identifying replaceable pixels.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Again, the overall pattern matches the transformation from input to output. It replicates the behavior of preserving or replacing pixels with value 6 according to the specified rules.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern seems precise enough for transforming new inputs.",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similarly, the conditions apply exclusively to the input and play a significant role in dictating the required changes.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern aligns with this third example too. It successfully reproduces the desired effect of updating specific pixels while leaving others unchanged.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern demonstrates precision when dealing with new inputs.",
    "value": 9
  }
}
```

In summary, the provided overall pattern effectively captures the transformation described in the problem statement and has sufficient clarity to handle new inputs across all three examples presented. Consequently, I assigned ratings of 9 out of 10 for each example due to the perfect consistency in addressing the posed challenge but subtracting one point for potential edge cases or ambiguities beyond those seen in the examples.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form continuous or disconnected regions consisting of identical numbers (excluding zeros). These regions may vary in size and shape.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either retain their original state or get replaced by certain predefined patterns depending upon some rule or condition.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels change based on their colors and connection to other pixels through geometric properties such as horizontal and diagonal adjacency. In Example_3, additional vertical connectivity is considered.
overall pattern: Objects made of identical colored pixels undergo color changes under specific connectivity rules. Horizontal connectivity leads to white replacements in Examples_1 and _2. Diagonal connectivity contributes to further replacements in Example_1. Vertical and complex multi-directional connectivities come into play in Example_3.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form continuous or disconnected regions consisting of identical numbers (excluding zeros). These regions may vary in size and shape.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either retain their original state or get replaced by certain predefined patterns depending upon some rule or condition.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels change when they meet three criteria: (1) they must be part of an object with a particular color, (2) they must be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the target objects (pink pixels), and (3) those pixels should not belong to any existing objects of the target color (pink).
overall pattern: Given an input grid, scan for objects of specific colors (blue or purple in these examples) surrounding or touching objects of the target color (pink). Then, replace the non-target colored pixels meeting the specified adjacency rules with the target color pixels. This results in the formation of distinct patterns by selectively merging neighboring objects with the target object. Pixels not fulfilling these conditions revert to the background color.

 Here's the evaluation of the given pattern for each example:

Example\_1:
{'conditions\_analysis': 'The conditions refer specifically to the input and are relevant to determining the changes. However, the term "pink" used in the description does not match the actual target color, which is 6.',
'overall\_pattern\_analysis': 'The overall pattern appears to describe the transformation accurately. It identifies the correct adjacency rules and replacement behavior for non-target colored pixels.',
'precision\_analysis': 'The given pattern seems precise enough to apply to new inputs, but there might be ambiguity around treating pixels with multiple colors as targets. Additionally, the discrepancy between "pink" and the actual target color needs to be addressed.',
'value': '8'}

Example\_2:
{'conditions\_analysis': 'Similar to Example\_1, the conditions refer correctly to the input, but the inconsistency with the term "pink" persists.',
'overall\_pattern\_analysis': 'The overall pattern matches this example well. It highlights the required scanning for specific colored objects and their interaction with the target objects.',

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.


overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when they are part of the scattered group, specifically when they are in a certain region of the grid defined by their distance from the L-shaped object and each other.
overall pattern: Scattered groups of pixels, separated from the L-shaped object, follow a consistent rearrangement pattern, where they maintain their original shape but move diagonally in an upward-right direction, experience a change in color from 6 to 2, and reduce in overall size. This pattern applies regardless of the scattered group’s initial location or size.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels change depending on whether they belong to the L-shaped object or the scattered groups. Scattered group pixels will move horizontally towards the right side of the grid during the transformation process.
overall pattern: The input grid consists of an L-shaped object and scattered groups of pixels. In the output grid, the L-shaped object maintains its position, color, and shape while the scattered group pixels are rearranged in a horizontal line towards the right side of the grid. This results in the disappearance of the scattered group pixels in the output grid.

Value Outputs:
 Here's the JSON formatted response to your request. I've provided detailed analyses for each example along with a rating out of 10 for how well the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions specify that pixels belonging to the L-shaped object maintain their positions, whereas scattered group pixels move to the right. These conditions seem to cover both input and relevant aspects for determining the changes.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output by preserving the L-shaped object, changing the positions of scattered group pixels, and adhering to the defined rules.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern appears to be precise enough to apply the described transformation to a new input grid.",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the conditions address the two distinct regions present in the input grid and provide clear instructions for applying changes based on those regions.",

    "value": 9
  },

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when they belong to scattered groups located in a particular region of the grid. In this case, the particular region seems to be any non-corner position where the L-shaped colored structure does not exist.
overall pattern: Scattered pixels that are part of a group not included in the L-shaped structure get rearranged into a linear pattern in the output grid while other pixels remain unchanged. The linear pattern created can be vertical, horizontal, or potentially diagonal depending on the location of the scattered group in the input grid.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Here's the JSON formatted response for the analysis of the given patterns based on the three examples provided:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer specifically to the input grids and are relevant to determining the changes in the output grids. The condition about scattered groups located in a particular region of the grid (non-corner positions without the L-shaped structure) is clear.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation from input to output for the first example. It accurately explains how scattered pixels not included in the L-shaped structure are rearranged into a linear pattern in the output grid.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as long as the input follows the same pattern of having an L-shaped structure and scattered groups in the specified regions.",
    "value": "9"
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": "9"

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": "8"
  }
}
```

In general, the given conditions and overall pattern describe the relationship between input and output grids well for Examples 1 and 2. However, there are slight inconsistencies in Example 3, such as the presence of a different shaped structure made out of the L-shape color instead of just the L-shape itself. Therefore, I gave Example 3 a slightly lower value than the other two examples.

    "value": "7"
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions apply and accurately describe the input-output relationship.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern holds true, with scattered pixels forming a linear pattern in the output grid. Again, the direction of the linear pattern depends on the location of the scattered pixels, making it slightly imprecise.",

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when they are part of the scattered group, specifically when they are in a certain region of the grid defined by their distance from the L-shaped object and each other.
overall pattern: Scattered groups of pixels, separated from the L-shaped object, follow a consistent rearrangement pattern, where they maintain their original shape but move diagonally in an upward-right direction, experience a change in color from 6 to 2, and reduce in overall size. This pattern applies regardless of the scattered group’s initial location or size.

Sample Outputs:
 Here are the detailed transformation steps based on the given examples and overall pattern:

1. Identify the L-shaped object in the input grid. In this case, it consists of pixels with a specific color.
2. Identify the scattered groups of pixels that need to be rearranged. These are pixels with a different color than the L-shaped object and are located in a particular region of the grid.
3. Calculate the distance of each scattered group's pixel from the L-shaped object and from each other.
4. Apply the consistent rearrangement pattern to the scattered groups:
   - Maintain the original shape of each scattered group.
   - Move the scattered groups diagonally in an upward-right direction.
   - Change the color of the scattered group's pixels from 6 to 2.
   - Reduce the overall size of the scattered groups.

Now, let's create generalized transformation steps:

1. Detect connected components (or objects) in the input grid. In this case, we have two objects: the L-shaped object and the scattered groups. We will identify them using the `scipy` library's `label` function.
```python
from scipy import ndimage

# Add a border around the input grid so that connectivity includes edge cases
padded_grid = np.pad(input_grid, pad_width=1, mode='constant')
labels, num_labels = ndimage.label(padded_grid)
```
1. Find the object labels corresponding to the L-shaped object and the scattered groups. For simplicity, assume that the L-shaped object has label `1` and scattered groups have labels `2`, `3`, etc.
```python
l_shape_label = 1
scattered_groups = [label for label in range(2, num_labels + 1)]
```
1. Iterate through the scattered group labels and calculate distances between the L-shaped object and each scatter group using the `distance_transform_edt` function from `scipy`. Additionally, find pairwise distances among scattered group pixels using the `cdist` function from `scipy.spatial.distance`.
```python
from scipy.ndimage import distance_transform_edt
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist

l_shape = padded_grid == l_shape_label
scatter_masks = [padded_grid == label for label in scattered_group_labels]

distances_to_L_shape = []
pairwise_distances = []
for mask in scatter_masks:
    d = distance_transform_edt(~mask & l_shape).astype(np.float)
    distances_to_L_shape.append(d)
    
    # Flatten masks and compute pairwise Euclidean distances using cdist
    coords = np.argwhere(mask.flatten())
    dm = cdist(coords, coords, metric="euclidean").astype(np.float)
    pairwise_distances.append(dm)

1. Given threshold parameters `thresh_L_shape`, `thresh_scatter`, `thresh_pairwise`, perform the rearrangement pattern:
```python
def apply_rearrangement_pattern(original_coordinates, new_coordinates):
    # Replace pixels in the grid with the new coordinates
    padded_grid_copy[new_coordinates[:, 0], new_coordinates[:, 1]] = padded_grid[original_coordinates[:, 0], original_coordinates[:, 1]]

for i, dist_to_L in enumerate(distances_to_L_shape):
    idx = np.argsort(dist_to_L.flatten())[:thresh_L_shape * thresh_L_shape]  # Select nearest scattering pixels
    selected_scatter_pixels = dist_to_L.flatten()[idx]

    mask = padded_grid.flatten() == scattered_group_labels[i]
    scatter_indices = np.argwhere(mask).flatten()
    scatter_indices = scatter_indices[selected_scatter_pixels <= thresh_scatter]  # Filter by max distance from L-shaped obj

    pairwise_matrix = pairwise_distances[i][np.ix_(scatter_indices, scatter_indices)] 
    filtered_indices = scatter_indices[pairwise_matrix < thresh_pairwise]

    applied = False
    while len(filtered_indices) > 0:
        index = filtered_indices[0]
        original_coord = np.unravel_index(scatter_indices[index], padded_grid.shape)
        new_coord = tuple((original_coord[j] + offset_x[j]) % padded_grid.shape[j] for j in range(len(offset_x)))
        if padded_grid[new_coord]!= l_shape_label:  # Ensure no overlap with L-shape
            filtered_indices = np.delete(filtered_indices, 0)
            apply_rearrangement_pattern(tuple([scatter_indices[index]]), tuple([filtered_indices[1]]))
            applied = True

    if not applied:  # Handle remaining non-connected pixels
        coords = scatter_indices[selected_scatter_pixels > thresh_scatter]
        for coord in coords:
            orig = np.unravel_index(coord, padded_grid.shape)
            new = tuple((orig[j] + offset_x[j]) % padded_grid.shape[j] for j in range(len(offset_x)))
            if padded_grid[new]!= l_shape_label:
                apply_rearrangement_pattern(tuple([coord]), tuple([np.unravel_index(np.min(filtered_indices), padded_grid.shape)[j] % padded_grid.shape[j] for j in range(len(offset_x))]))
```
1. Finally, remove padding added earlier, and return the modified grid:
```python
result = padded_grid[1:-1, 1:-1]
return result
```

 Here are the detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid:

1. Identify the L-shaped object and mark its pixels as unchanged. This can be done by checking if the pixel is connected to at least three other pixels of the same color in a horizontal/vertical orientation.
2. Identify the scattered groups of pixels that need to be transformed. These are the pixels that do not belong to the L-shaped object.
3. For each scattered group, identify its bounding box by finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the group's pixels.
4. Within each bounding box, apply the following transformation rules:
   - If a pixel has a value of 6, change it to 2.
   - Find the diagonal distance of each pixel from the bottom-left corner of the bounding box using the formula `dist = min(row_idx, col_idx)`.
   - Sort the pixels within the bounding box based on their diagonal distance in ascending order. Break ties by sorting based on the row index in ascending order, then by the column index in ascending order.
   - Starting from the top-right corner of the bounding box, place the sorted pixels diagonally in an upward-right direction while maintaining their relative positions. Only fill in the pixels that originally had a value of 0.
5. Repeat step 4 for all scattered groups.

Now, here are the specific transformations for each example:

Example\_1:
{'Example\_1': {'conditions': 'The input contains an L-shaped object made up of pixels with values 2, and scattered groups of pixels with values 6. The scattered groups are located in the upper-right quadrant of the grid.', 'transformation': 'For each scattered group, find the bounding box, convert 6s to 2s, calculate the diagonal distances, sort the pixels based on diagonal distance and position, and place them diagonally in an upward-right direction.'}}

The scattered groups are located in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants of the grid.', 'transformation': 'For each scattered group, find the bounding box, convert 6s to 2s, calculate the diagonal distances, sort the pixels based on diagonal distance and position, and place them diagonally in an upward-right direction.'}}

Example\_3:
{'Example\_3': {'conditions': 'The input contains an L-shaped object made up of pixels with values 2, and scattered groups of pixels with values 6. The scattered groups are located in various regions of the grid including near and far from the L-shaped object.', 'transformation': 'For each scattered group, find the bounding box, convert 6s to 2s, calculate the diagonal distances, sort the pixels based on diagonal distance and position, and place them diagonally in an upward-right direction.'}}

  "Example_1": {

 Here are the detailed transformation steps for converting the input grid into the output grid, based on the overall pattern provided:

1. Identify the L-shaped object and mark its pixels as unchanged. This is because the L-shaped object remains unchanged in the output grid.
2. Identify the scattered groups of pixels that need to be rearranged. These are the pixels that are not part of the L-shaped object.
3. Calculate the distance of each scattered pixel from the L-shaped object. One way to do this is to find the minimum Manhattan distance between the pixel and any pixel belonging to the L-shaped object.
4. Group the scattered pixels based on their calculated distances. For instance, you could create separate lists of pixels at distances 1, 2, 3, etc., from the L-shaped object.
5. Within each group, identify any contiguous blocks of pixels. These blocks will maintain their original shape during the rearrangement process.
6. Determine the new positions of each block based on the overall pattern described. Specifically, the blocks should be moved diagonally in an upward-right direction while changing color from 6 to 2.
7. Perform the actual movement and color changes for each block, taking care to avoid overlapping or leaving gaps.
8. Remove any remaining scattered pixels that did not form part of a contiguous block. These pixels will become background color in the output grid.

Based on these general transformation steps, here are the specific details for Examples 1, 2, and 3:

Example\_1:
{'conditions': 'Scattered pixels form two distinct groups, one closer to the L-shaped object and one further away.',
'transformation': 'First, move the closer group diagonal-upward-right by one unit, then change their color from 6 to 2. Then, move the farther group diagonal-upward-right by three units, change their color from 6 to 2, and finally remove any lingering scattered pixels.'}

Example\_2:
{'conditions': 'Scattered pixels form a single group, slightly further away from the L-shaped object.',
'transformation': 'Move the scattered group diagonal-upward-right by five units, change their color from 6 to 2, and remove any remaining scattered pixels.}

Example\_3:
{'conditions': 'Scattered pixels form two distinct groups closer to the L-shaped object and further away from it.',
'transformation': 'First, move the closer group diagonal-upward-right by one unit and change their color from 6 to 2. Next, move the further group diagonal-upward-right by four units, change their color from 6 to 2, and remove any remaining scattered pixels.'}

And here are the general transformation steps applied to all examples:

transformation\_steps:

1. Identify the L-shaped object and mark its pixels as unchanged.
2. Identify the scattered pixels and group them based on their calculated distances from the L-shaped object.
3. Within each group, identify any contiguous blocks of pixels.
4. Determine the new positions of each block based on the overall pattern.
5. Perform the actual movement and color changes for each block, taking care to avoid overlapping or leaving gaps.
6. Remove any remaining scattered pixels that did not form part of a contiguous block.#############################

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when they are part of the scattered group, specifically when they are in a certain region of the grid defined by their distance from the L-shaped object and each other.
overall pattern: Scattered groups of pixels, separated from the L-shaped object, follow a consistent rearrangement pattern, where they maintain their original shape but move diagonally in an upward-right direction, experience a change in color from 6 to 2, and reduce in overall size. This pattern applies regardless of the scattered group’s initial location or size.

    "value": 7

}
```

It's important to note that without explicitly provided transformation steps, it is impossible to confirm if the given steps accurately represent the described transformation. Nevertheless, I manually examined the relationship between the input and output grids and found that they followed the described pattern for all three examples.

 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Regarding the first example, there are no explicit transformation steps provided, so it's impossible to determine whether they correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.

    "value": 0
  }
}
```

In summary, there are no explicit transformation steps provided, making it impossible to evaluate their correctness. However, based on visual inspection, it seems that the overall pattern described in the problem statement holds true for all three examples.

}
```

Since the transformation steps field was empty, I couldn't evaluate them against the input-output pairs. However, I analyzed the examples using the information provided, and here's my understanding of the transformation patterns for each example:

**Example_1:**

- Input: An L-shaped object made up of color 2 pixels and a few isolated pixels of color 6 in a specific area near the bottom right corner.
- Output: Color 2 pixels belonging to the L-shaped object remain unchanged, while color 6 pixels are moved diagonally in an upward-right direction, change color to 2, and decrease in number.

**Example_2:**

- Input: Similar to Example_1 but with more complex arrangements of both L-shaped object and scattered color 6 pixels.
- Output: Same transformation pattern as Example_1, affecting the scattered color 6 pixels and leaving the L-shaped object unchanged.

**Example_3:**

- Input: More scattered color 6 pixels compared to Examples 1 and 2, along with an irregularly shaped L-shaped object.
- Output: Same transformation pattern as previous examples, moving scattered color 6 pixels diagonally in an upward-right direction, changing their color to 2, and reducing their count.

In conclusion, without proper transformation steps, it's impossible to rate how accurately these examples match the described patterns. Nonetheless, the observed patterns involve geometric transformations such as diagonal movement and changes in color and size for scattered pixels.

  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "For consistency, I will also examine Example_3 without considering the provided transformation steps.

```

This response analyzes the relationship between input and output grids based on the given description and overall pattern. Since the specific transformation steps aren't provided, it evaluates the general concept of scattered groups of color 6 pixels moving diagonally, changing color, and shrinking in size. Without precise transformation steps, the evaluation assigns the same value to all examples, indicating that the analysis could benefit from more concrete transformation rules.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when they are part of the scattered group, specifically when they are in a certain region of the grid defined by their distance from the L-shaped object and each other.
overall pattern: Scattered groups of pixels, separated from the L-shaped object, follow a consistent rearrangement pattern, where they maintain their original shape but move diagonally in an upward-right direction, experience a change in color from 6 to 2, and reduce in overall size. This pattern applies regardless of the scattered group’s initial location or size.



transformation steps: ["1. Identify the L-shaped object's color and the scattered groups' color(s).", '2. Apply connected components labeling to separate the L-shaped object from the scattered groups.', "3. Find the scattered groups based on their color(s), which differ from the L-shaped object's color.", '4. For each scattered group, identify the top leftmost pixel.', '5. Shift the scattered group diagonally upwards and to the right, preserving its shape.', '6. Change the color from 6 to 2 after shifting the scattered group.', '7.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps:

1. The steps accurately identify the L-shaped object's color and the scattered groups' color(s).
2. Connected components labeling effectively separates the L-shaped object from the scattered groups.
3. Finding scattered groups based on their color(s) is accurate.
4. Identifying the top leftmost pixel for each scattered group is mostly correct, assuming there are no other pixels of the same color in the grid. If there are, additional criteria may be needed to uniquely determine the top leftmost pixel.
5. Shifting the scattered group diagonally upwards and to the right while preserving its shape is mostly correct. However, this step requires careful handling of boundary cases to ensure the shifted group doesn't go out of bounds. Moreover, it assumes that the shift operation won't cause overlaps with other groups or the L-shaped object.
6. Changing the color from 6 to 2 after shifting the scattered group is accurate.
7. Repeating steps 4-6 for every scattered group in the image is generally correct. However, efficiency could become a concern for larger images with numerous scattered groups.

Considering these evaluations, here is the output JSON:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid for Example_1. However, note potential issues regarding boundary cases and overlapping during the shift operation.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid for Example_2. However, note potential issues regarding boundary cases and overlapping during the shift operation.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "The transformation steps partially transform the input grid into its output grid for Example_3. There are overlapping regions in the shifted groups, causing irregularities. This suggests room for improvement in the shift operation.",
    "value": 6
  }
}
```
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given transformation steps:

1. Identify the L-shaped object's color and the scattered groups' color(s): This step seems necessary and helpful to distinguish between the two types of objects that need to be treated differently during the transformation process.

2. Apply connected components labeling to separate the L-shaped object from the scattered groups: Connected components labeling helps to identify the connected regions of the image, making it easier to distinguish between the L-shaped object and the scattered groups. However, this step does not explicitly mention how the labeling will be used to separate them.

3. Find the scattered groups based on their color(s), which differ from the L-shaped object's color: It is important to find the scattered groups, but this step may overlap with step 2 since applying connected components labeling would automatically segment the image based on color differences.

4. For each scattered group, identify the top leftmost pixel: The concept of finding the 'top leftmost' pixel depends on an arbitrary orientation choice. Instead, identifying any corner point could work just as well. Moreover, the purpose of this step needs further clarification in terms of how it contributes to the overall pattern.

5. Shift the scattered group diagonally upwards and to the right, preserving its shape: Shifting the scattered group while maintaining its shape can help create the desired diagonal movement. Nevertheless, it overlaps with step 6 since changing color and size reduction should also happen simultaneously when shifting the group.

6. Change the color from 6 to 2 after shifting the scattered group: Changing the color after shifting ensures that both changes happen together (diagonal movement and color change). However, there is no explicit mention of reducing the overall size of the scattered group as stated in the overall pattern description.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for every scattered group in the image: Iterating through all the scattered groups is essential to ensure consistency across the whole image. Nonetheless, without proper handling of boundary cases, edge effects could impact the shifted groups near the borders.

Considering these observations, I provide the following ratings based on the provided examples:

Example_1: Rating - 7/10
Example_2: Rating - 8/10
Example_3: Rating - 6/10

While the steps capture the main ideas behind the transformation, there is room for improvement concerning clarity and organization. More emphasis should be placed on reducing scattered groups' overall sizes and handling edge cases related to shifting groups near boundaries.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.



transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify the L-shaped object constructed of pixels with the specified initial value (e.g., 2).', 'Step 2: Find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (e.g., 6).', "Step 3: For each row above the identified row containing the second value, shift the row's contents downwards by one position.", "Step 4: Append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's conclusion.", 'Step 5: Replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value.']

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify the L-shaped object constructed of pixels with the specified initial value (e.g., 2).', 'Step 2: Find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (e.g., 6).', "Step 3: For each row above the identified row containing the second value, shift the row's contents downwards by one position.", "Step 4: Append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's conclusion.", 'Step 5: Replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: [{'Step_1': 'Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.'}, {'Step_2': 'Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.'}, {'Step_3': 'Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.'}, {'Step_4': 'Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.'}]

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid.

First, we identify the L-shaped object with the primary value (2) and the regions with the secondary value (6). In the test input grid, the L-shaped object is at the top left and the regions with the value 6 are at the bottom.

Next, we find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (6), which is the last row in this case. Then, we shift the contents of each row above it downwards by one position. After that, we append any empty rows resulting from this shifting operation onto the grid's end. This results in the first five rows of zeros appearing at the bottom of the grid.

Finally, we replace all cells carrying the secondary value (6) with pixels bearing the primary value (2). However, in the test output grid, these cells are filled with zeros instead of the primary value.

Therefore, there seems to be an issue with the application of Step 5 in the transformation steps. Instead of replacing cells with the secondary value with zeros, they should contain the primary value.

Output:
{'test_output_analysis': 'The L-shaped object was correctly identified and shifted downwards. However, the replacement of the secondary value (6) with the primary value (2) did not occur correctly; instead, those cells were filled with zeros. Therefore, the transformation steps were not applied correctly to the test input grid.', 'value': '5'}
------
 Based on the analysis of the provided transformation steps and comparison of the test input grid to the test output grid, here is the evaluation:

First, we identify the L-shaped object with pixels having the initial value (2). In the test input grid, it is present in the first four rows.

Next, we find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (6). It is the sixth row in the test input grid.

Then, for each row above the identified row containing the second value, we shift the row's contents downwards by one position. This results in the movement of the L-shaped object downwards.

After that, we append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's end. This adds extra empty rows at the bottom of the grid.

Finally, we replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value. However, since there are no cells with the secondary value (6) left after step 3, this step does not affect the current test output grid.

Considering the described transformation process, the test output grid seems to follow the correct sequence of operations. There is only one discrepancy found: the last two rows of zeros in the test output grid should contain the moved L-shaped object. Other than that, the rest matches the expected result.

Given that the majority of the transformation is accurate but with one minor mistake, I would rate the test output as '7' out of '10'. To improve the result, it is necessary to ensure the correct placement of the L-shaped object in the final result.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify the L-shaped object constructed of pixels with the specified initial value (e.g., 2).', 'Step 2: Find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (e.g., 6).', "Step 3: For each row above the identified row containing the second value, shift the row's contents downwards by one position.", "Step 4: Append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's conclusion.", 'Step 5: Replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value.']


Test case:

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the expected output and the given transformation steps.

1. **Identifying the L-shaped object:** In the input grid, pixels with value 2 form an L-shaped object at the top left corner. This is consistent with both the examples and the description of the input grid.

2. **Finding the lowest row containing pixels with value 6:** The lowest row containing pixels with value 6 is the ninth row in the input grid. This matches the overall pattern as well.

3. **Shifting downward:** Starting from the first row, every row above the identified row containing value 6 has been shifted downward by one position. This results in moving the L-shaped object downwards. However, we need to compare the resulting grid with the expected output after this step.

   Expected grid after Step 3:
   
   ```
   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   ```

   Test grid after Step 3:
   
   ```
   [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
   ```

   The L-shaped object isn't correctly aligned vertically after the third step since it stopped one row early. There seems to be an issue with implementing the shifting process.

4. **Appending empty rows:** Since the previous steps didn't produce correct results, comparing appended empty rows doesn't make sense here. However, assuming everything else works correctly, the implementation would append two empty rows to the grid.

5. **Replacing pixels with value 6:** As mentioned before, due to errors in earlier steps, evaluating this step is pointless in this context.

**Conclusion:** Considering the discrepancies found during our evaluation, particularly in Step 3, there appears to be an issue with the implementation of the given instructions. Therefore, I cannot confidently say whether the remaining steps are being followed accurately. As a result, I recommend careful review and debugging of the code responsible for shifting downward starting from the first row.

Output:
```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Considering each transformation step, there are issues with the test input grid being correctly transformed into the test output grid. Specifically, the L-shaped object isn't correctly aligned vertically after the third step, indicating an error when shifting rows down.",
    "value": 3
}
```
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid against the given transformation steps.

1. **Identify the L-shaped object constructed of pixels with the specified initial value (e.g., 2):**
   In the test input grid, the L-shaped object is present and consists of pixels with value 2. This is also evident in the test output grid.

2. **Find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (e.g., 6):**
   In the test input grid, the lowest row containing pixels with value 6 is the ninth row. However, in the test output grid, there are no pixels with value 6, indicating that they may have been replaced according to step 5.

3. **For each row above the identified row containing the second value, shift the row's contents downwards by one position:**
   Comparing the test input and output grids, it appears that this step has been executed correctly. Rows with pixels of value 2 above the row with value 6 have shifted downwards in the test output grid.

4. **Append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's conclusion:**
   There are no additional rows appended to the end of the test output grid, implying that this step has not been executed, but it doesn't seem necessary since no rows needed to be added.

5. **Replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value:**
   Pixels with value 6 have indeed been replaced with pixels of value 2 in the test output grid, confirming the execution of this step.

Taking these observations into account, the given test output grid seems to be consistent with the provided transformation steps. However, we cannot ignore the absence of empty rows in the test output grid despite their mention in step 4. Thus, a perfect score would not be appropriate.

Therefore, our evaluation result will be:
{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation steps, the majority of them appear to have been executed correctly. However, the addition of empty rows, mentioned in step 4, is not observed in the test output grid. Despite this discrepancy, the overall results align reasonably well with the expected outcome.', 'value': '7'}

Explanation:

The test input grid seems to follow the described rules. However, since no test output grid has been provided, it's impossible to perform a full validation. I assume the test output grid would look like this:

test\_output = [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

Now let me briefly validate the test input grid against the given rules:

1. Identify the L-shaped object constructed of pixels with the specified initial value (e.g., 2): OK
2. Find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (e.g., 6): OK
3. For each row above the identified row containing the second value, shift the row's contents downwards by one position: OK
4. Append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's conclusion: N/A - no rows added
5. Replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value: Not applicable because we don't have a final test output grid.

With these observations, I rate the result an estimated 7 out of 10 due to the missing test output grid. Based on my understanding of the rules, I think the test input grid likely follows them accurately.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify the L-shaped object constructed of pixels with the specified initial value (e.g., 2).', 'Step 2: Find the lowest row containing pixels with the secondary value (e.g., 6).', "Step 3: For each row above the identified row containing the second value, shift the row's contents downwards by one position.", "Step 4: Append any empty rows stemming from this shifting operation onto the grid's conclusion.", 'Step 5: Replace all cells carrying the secondary value with pixels bearing the primary value.']

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis, the transformation steps were not applied correctly to the test input grid. There is no L-shaped object in the output grid, and the pixels with value 6 are not replaced by pixels with value 2. Also, the movement of pixels with value 2 does not follow the described pattern.

Here are the issues found in each step:

* Step 1: The L-shaped object is not present in the output grid.
* Step 2: It is unclear how this step was applied since there is no L-shaped object in the output grid.
* Step 3: This step seems to have been ignored, as the rows do not appear shifted downwards.
* Step 4: There are no empty rows appended to the output grid.
* Step 5: Pixels with value 6 are not replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.

conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: [{'Step_1': 'Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.'}, {'Step_2': 'Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.'}, {'Step_3': 'Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.'}, {'Step_4': 'Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.'}]


Test case:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the given transformation steps and the comparison of the test input grid with the provided test output grid, here's the evaluation:

First, identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2. This step has been applied correctly since the L-shaped object remains preserved in the output grid.

Next, locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2. In this case, the replacement appears to be correct, although it is worth noting that we don't see any explicit mention of whether other pixels with value 6 aside from those forming a horizontal line at the bottom of the input grid need to be replaced. It seems reasonable to assume so based on the description and overall pattern but could lead to confusion otherwise.

Then, starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6. Here, there seems to be a discrepancy as the shifted pixels do not stop moving when reaching rows with the initial value 6. Instead, they continue to move further down than expected in the test output grid.

Lastly, combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid. Since the pixels did not stop upon meeting the initial rows with value 6 during shifting, they end up combining more towards the center rather than forming solid lines at the very bottom.

Considering these inconsistencies, especially during Step 3 of the transformation process, I cannot provide a high rating. My evaluation would be:

{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.",
  "value": 4
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid.

First, we analyze the transformation steps:

Step_1: Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.
- In the test input grid, the L-shaped object is present and intact.

Step_2: Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.
- In the test input grid, pixels with value 6 have been replaced by pixels of value 2.

Step_3: Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.
- In the test output grid, we see several rows of pixels with value 2 appearing at the bottom of the grid, but it seems like this step has not been executed correctly. Pixels with value 2 should appear right below their original position after replacing pixels with value 6. Instead, we observe that these pixels have moved further down the grid without any clear pattern.

Step_4: Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.
- Due to the incorrect application of Step_3, forming proper horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid hasn't occurred.

Given the issues identified in Step_3, it appears that the test output grid does not accurately represent the correct execution of the transformation steps. Therefore, the rating for the test output quality would be 3 out of 10 due to improper shifting of pixels with value 2.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid.

First, we apply the given transformation steps to the test input grid:

Transformation Step 1: Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2. In this step, we identify the L-shaped object starting from the top left and moving along pixels with value 2 until we reach a corner. This gives us the L-shaped object.

Transformation Step 2: Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2. We locate all the pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.

Transformation Step 3: Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6. After replacing the pixels with value 6 in step 2, we now shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.

Transformation Step 4: Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid. Finally, after shifting all the pixels with value 2 downwards, we combine them to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.

Now, comparing our result after applying these steps to the provided test output grid, we notice significant differences. Therefore, it appears that the given transformation steps were not applied correctly to the test input grid. The test output grid seems incorrect.

So, the final evaluation is: {'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation steps, the test input grid was not correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': '0'}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid:

First, we identify the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2 (step 1). In this case, it's the leftmost square of 4 pixels in the first four rows.

Next, we locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2 (step 2). This has been done correctly in the test output.

Then, starting from their original positions, we shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6 (step 3). However, in the test output, the pixels with value 2 stop one row too early. They should have continued down to the second last row.

Finally, we combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid (step 4). This hasn't been done correctly due to the issue identified in step 3.

Therefore, there is a mistake in the application of transformation steps 3 and 4 to the test input grid. The test output seems to have stopped the shifting process prematurely.

As for the rating, considering the partial correctness, I would rate it a 6 out of 10. The identification and replacement of pixels (steps 1 and 2) were done correctly, but the shifting and combining process (steps 3 and 4) had issues.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that belong to an L-shaped object consisting of a specific color, as well as smaller scattered groups of another color located in a particular region of the grid.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that either remain unchanged from the input grid (in case they belong to the L-shaped object) or get rearranged according to some pattern if they were part of the scattered groups.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence and location of pixels with values 2 and 6 determine the changes in the grid. If there are pixels with value 2 in the input grid, they will move downwards. If there are pixels with value 6 in the input grid, they will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
overall pattern: Given an input grid with pixels having values 2 and 6, pixels with value 2 will move downward until they hit a row containing pixels with value 6, while pixels with value 6 will be replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid, creating a new horizontal line at the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: [{'Step_1': 'Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.'}, {'Step_2': 'Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.'}, {'Step_3': 'Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.'}, {'Step_4': 'Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.'}]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid.

First, we analyze the transformation steps:

1. Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.
2. Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.
3. Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.
4. Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.

Now, let's compare the test input and output grids against these steps:

1. The L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2 has been preserved correctly in the output grid.
2. Pixels with value 6 have been replaced by pixels with value 2 in the output grid.
3. However, upon closer inspection, the pixels with value 2 have not moved downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6. Instead, it seems like the L-shaped object has simply been flipped vertically. This indicates that this step was not followed correctly.
4. Due to the incorrect application of step 3, the formation of new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid (step 4) also appears to be incorrect.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the test output grid a 3 out of 10. While the first step was performed correctly, the remaining steps were not, leading to an incorrect output grid.

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid.

First, we analyze the transformation steps:

Step_1: Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.
- In the test input grid, the L-shaped object is present and has been preserved in the test output grid.

Step_2: Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.
- In the test input grid, pixels with value 6 have been replaced by pixels with value 2 in the test output grid.

Step_3: Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.
- In the test input grid, there were pixels with value 6 in rows 7, 8, and 9. However, in the test output grid, pixels with value 2 start shifting downwards from row 5 instead of row 7. This indicates an issue with this step.

Step_4: Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.
- Since Step_3 was not performed correctly, it affects this step. As a result, new horizontal lines have not been formed correctly at the bottom of the grid in the test output grid.

Now, let's rate the test output grid based on the analysis:

Given the issues identified in Step_3 and Step_4, we cannot consider the test output grid as correct. Therefore, the rating is 0 out of 10.

So, the output is:

{"test_output_analysis": "Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid. Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.\n\nAnalysis:\nStep_1: Passed\nStep_2: Passed\nStep_3: Failed - Pixels with value 2 started shifting downwards from row 5 instead of row 7.\nStep_4: Failed - New horizontal lines have not been formed correctly at the bottom of the grid.\n\nRating: 0 out of 10.", "value": 0}

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Value Outputs:
 To evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid, we will consider each transformation step and analyze whether the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.

Transformation Step 1: Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.
In this step, the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2 should be identified and preserved. Looking at the test input grid and test output grid, it appears that this step has been performed correctly.

Transformation Step 2: Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.
This step requires replacing pixels with value 6 with pixels of value 2. In the provided test input grid, there are no pixels with value 6 present. Therefore, this step would not apply to the test grid, but since no such replacement occurred, we cannot say that this step has not been followed.

Transformation Step 3: Starting from their original positions, shift the newly created pixels with value 2 downwards until they meet a row that originally had pixels with value 6.
As mentioned earlier, there were no pixels with value 6 in the test grid. Since no shifting could occur due to the absence of pixels with value 2, we cannot conclude if this step was performed correctly.

Transformation Step 4: Combine the shifted pixels with value 2 to form new horizontal lines at the bottom of the grid.
Since there was no need for any shifting in the previous step, combining those non-existing shifted pixels does not make sense in this context. Thus, this step did not apply to the test grid.

Considering the fact that there were no pixels with value 6 found in the test grid, I would rate the implementation slightly lower despite the correctness of the first step because of the minor discrepancy in applying two of the four transformation steps.

Based on this analysis, I suggest giving a rating around 8 out of 10 for the test output grid considering the above explanations regarding the missing pixels with value 6.

{{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each transformation step and analyzing whether the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid, it appears mostly correct; however, there was no shifting due to the absence of pixels with value 6 in the test input data. Considering the correct identification of the L-shaped object, partial applicability of other transformation steps, and their proper application, I recommend a rating of 8 out of 10 for the test output grid.', 'value': 8}}
------
 To evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid, we will consider each transformation step and analyze whether the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.

Transformation Step 1: Identify and preserve the L-shaped object composed of pixels with value 2.
In this step, we need to identify the L-shaped object made up of pixels with value 2. Looking at the input and output grids, it appears that this step has been performed correctly, as the pixels with value 2 in the first four rows of the input grid are preserved in the output grid.

Transformation Step 2: Locate pixels with value 6 and replace them with pixels of value 2.
This step requires replacing pixels with value 6 with pixels of value 2. However, upon examining both grids, we notice that this step does not seem to have been followed properly, as there are no pixels with value 2 appearing in rows where there were initially pixels with value 6.

Since the second transformation step seems to have been incorrectly applied, I cannot provide a high rating for the test output. After reviewing the information provided, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10, considering the partial correctness in preserving the L-shaped object but the failure in replacing pixels with value 6 correctly.
