The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYour task is to describe the given input and output grids.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: \"A typical input grid shows pixels that...\"', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: \"A typical output grid shows pixels that...\"'}}.

This creates new objects and modifies existing objects in the output grid.\noverall pattern: Based on the adjacency relationships between pixels with values 0, 4, and 6, pixels change values, creating new objects and altering existing objects in the output grid. The overall shape and organization of the input grid remain unchanged.\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n Here's the JSON formatted response for your request:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions for Example_1 are vague and do not specify exactly which adjacencies result in value changes. However, they are relevant to determining the changes in the input grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern seems to accurately describe the transformation from input to output for Example_1. It explains how adjacency relationships cause pixel value changes and object modifications while preserving the overall shape of the input grid.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is somewhat imprecise since it does not clearly define the rules governing pixel value changes based on specific adjacency relationships. For instance, it doesn't explain why certain pixels become '6' or why specific patterns of adjacency lead to particular value changes.\",\n    \"value\": 7\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, the conditions are vague but still relevant to determining the changes in the input grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern holds true for Example_2, where adjacency relationships lead to pixel value changes and object modifications without altering the global structure.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"As before, the overall pattern lacks precision in defining the exact rules for pixel value changes, making it difficult to apply directly to new inputs without further clarification.\",\n    \"value\": 7\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Same as previous examples, the conditions are relevant but not detailed enough to predict pixel value changes precisely.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern also applies to Example_3, capturing how adjacency relationships drive pixel value changes and structural preservation.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Again, the overall pattern requires more clarity in describing the specific value change rules caused by various adjacency configurations.\",\n    \"value\": 7\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the given overall pattern effectively captures the nature of the transformation present across the three examples. However, its primary drawback lies in its lack of precision when outlining the exact rules governing pixel value changes due to adjacency relationships, leading to a lower score for each example.\n------\n Here's the JSON output with the analysis for each example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions specify that pixels change values based on their adjacency to other pixels with specific values (0, 4, and 6). This is relevant to determine the changes in the output grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output in this example, as pixels change values based on their adjacency relationships with 0, 4, and 6, preserving the overall shape and organization of the input grid.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output since it clearly defines the conditions under which pixels change values based on their adjacency relationships with 0, 4, and 6.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are applicable as they describe the adjacency of pixels with specific values affecting the value changes in the output grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern correctly captures the relationship between the input and output grids, accounting for pixel value changes due to connections with 0, 4, and 6 while maintaining the general layout.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern provides sufficient precision to replicate the transformation process for other input grids with similar characteristics and adjacency behaviors.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are correct, referring to the impact of pixel adjacency on value changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern matches the transformation process, where pixels change values according to their relations with 0, 4, and 6 without changing the global configuration.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The provided overall pattern contains enough information to apply the rule consistently to various input grids like the given examples.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  }\n}\n```"

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nYou are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}.

There are several discrepancies when comparing it to the expected outcome.\n\nIn the test input grid, there are multiple instances where pixels with a value of 0 are horizontally or vertically adjacent to pixels with a value of 4. According to the provided rules, these pixels should be changed to value 6. However, this change has not been consistently applied throughout the test output grid. For instance, let's consider the area surrounding the first occurrence of the number 4, starting from the leftmost position in the second row:\n\nTest Input: [[0, 0, 4,...\nTest Output: [[0, 0, 4,...\n\nHere, we would expect the pixel with value 0 to the right of the first 4 to be changed to value 6, since they are horizontally adjacent. But this is not the case in the test output grid. This issue occurs in other places in the grid as well.\n\nAdditionally, while evaluating the consistency of applying the rule about replacing pixels with a value of 0 adjacent to pixels with a value of 4 with the value of 6, another inconsistency appears. In the bottom part of the grid, the rule is followed more closely; however, due to the issues mentioned earlier, the transformation cannot be considered correct.\n\nGiven the problems discussed above, I would rate the test output as a 3 out of 10, as the transformation is partially applicable but lacks consistency. To improve the quality, it is recommended to double-check the implementation against the provided rules and ensure the application covers all cases appropriately.\n------\n Based on the analysis of the transformation steps, the test output grid seems to have misapplied some steps.\n\nThe main objective is to change pixels with value 0 that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to pixels with value 4 to value 6 while keeping pixels with value 4 unchanged. However, in the test output grid, there are instances where this rule has not been followed correctly.\n\nFor instance, consider the area around the first four rows and columns:\n\nInput:\n```\n[[0, 0, 4, 4,...\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[[0, 0, 4, 4,...\n```\nIn this region, the pixels with value 0 surrounding the value 4 blocks should have been changed to value 6. Instead, they remain as 0 in the provided output grid.\n\nConsidering these discrepancies, I would rate the test output a 2 out of 10 since it did not follow the specified rules correctly.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid.

The type of adjacency (horizontal/vertical or diagonal) determines whether the pattern matches Examples 1, 2, or 3.

Identify pixels with value 0 adjacent to pixels with value 4 (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n   - This condition is met throughout the grid.\n2. Replace those identified pixels with value 6.\n   - The output grid reflects these replacements accurately.\n\nBy checking the transformation steps against the test input and output grids, it appears that the given output corresponds to the correct application of the rules. Therefore, our analysis gives a high confidence level regarding the proper execution of the transformation steps.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Considering each transformation step, the test input grid has been correctly transformed into its test output grid.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n Based on the analysis of the provided transformation pattern and the test input-output pair, here's the evaluation:\n\nThe overall pattern suggests that pixels with a value of 0, which are horizontally or vertically adjacent to pixels with a value of 4, should change to value 6. Diagonal adjacencies do not seem to affect the pattern in this case.\n\nApplying this pattern to the test input grid, we can see that the output grid has pixels with a value of 6 in places where the pattern conditions are met. However, there is also a discrepancy:\n\nInput grid:\n```\n...4444444.\n...44....0\n...44....0\n...4..0000\n...4..0000\n...4.0000\n.....0000\n.....0600\n.....0660\n.....0666\n```\nOutput grid:\n```\n.6666666.\n.6666..0.\n.6666..0.\n.666.0000\n.666.0000\n.66.0000\n....0000\n....0000\n....0600\n....0660\n```\nIn the fourth row of the input grid, there are two horizontal adjacencies between 0 and 4; however, these did not result in changing the 0 to 6 in the output grid, making it inconsistent with the described pattern. This inconsistency raises concerns about the proper application of the transformation steps to the test input grid.\n\nConsidering the observed discrepancy and applying the overall pattern consistently would result in the following correct output grid:\n\nCorrected Output grid:\n```\n.6666666.\n.6666..0.\n.6666..0.\n.66660000\n.66660000\n.66.0000\n....0000\n....0000\n....0600\n....0660\n```\nGiven the analysis and comparison between the actual and corrected output grids, we cannot approve the test output grid entirely due to the mentioned inconsistency. Therefore, I recommend giving a lower rating since the transformation steps appear to have been partially incorrectly applied to the test input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation pattern and test input-output pair, there is an inconsistency found in the test output grid. The fourth row of the input grid does not follow the expected pattern, resulting in incorrect values in the output grid compared to the corrected version.', 'value': '5'}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid.

Here's the correct application of the steps:\n\nCorrected output:\n[[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nRating: 0 out of 10. The test output did not adhere to the provided transformation steps.\n------\n Based on the analysis of the given transformation pattern and the test input-output pair, it seems that the test output grid does not adhere to the specified rules. According to the overall pattern provided, pixels with a value of 0 that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to pixels with value 4 should change to value 6. However, in the test output grid, we see instances where this rule has not been followed consistently. For instance, consider the section of the input grid:\n\n[[0, 0, 4, 4],\n [0, 0, 4, 4],\n [0, 0, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nAccording to the pattern, since the pixel with value 0 in the bottom left corner is horizontally and vertically adjacent to pixels with value 4, it should be changed to 6 in the output grid. But in the given test output grid, it remains 0.\n\nTherefore, I would rate the accuracy of the test output as 3 out of 10, considering the inconsistencies found in the application of the specified transformation pattern.#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid.

Here's the justification behind this conclusion:\n\n1. Identify L-shaped configurations made up of pixels with value 4 in the input grid.\n   - In the test input grid, there are two L-shaped configurations with 4s: (top left) from index [1, 2] to [3, 4] and (bottom right) around index [7, 8] to [9, 10].\n\n2. Replace pixels forming the L-shaped configurations with value 6 in the output grid, keeping their shape and size intact.\n   - In the test output grid, we see two L-shaped configurations replaced with 6s matching the original ones.\n\n3. Add an extra object with value 6 in a corner of the grid where an L-shaped object doesn't exist based on the overall pattern description.\n   - An additional object made up of 6s has been added to the bottom left corner of the grid, where no L-shaped object exists.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy regarding the first transformation step since another L-shaped structure is present in the output grid at the top right corner. After consulting the problem statement, I noticed that the instruction states \"generate an additional object with value 6 in one of the corners,\" whereas the provided output includes both corners of the grid having a value of 6. Thus, I will rate the accuracy of the output based on whether the primary goal of replacing the L-shaped structures with 6s is achieved properly.\n\nConsidering the primary objective, the process seems accurate; however, an unnecessary modification in the top right corner unrelated to any L-shaped structure detracts from the correctness. Considering these factors, my evaluation is as follows:\n\n{\n  'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each transformation step individually, the replacement of L-shaped configurations made up of pixels with value 4 in the input grid with value 6 in the output grid was performed accurately. However, one additional instance of adding a value of 6 in the top right corner, not related to any L-shaped structure found in the output grid, does not align with the described instructions. Although the main transformation targeting L-shaped structures was carried out appropriately, the inclusion of the extra corner with 6s negatively affects the overall precision.',\n  'value': '8'\n}\n------\n Based on the analysis of the test output grid using the provided transformation steps, here is the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.\\n\\nTransformation Step 1: Identify L-shaped configurations made up of pixels with value 4 in the input grid.\\nIn the test input grid, there are two L-shaped configurations with pixels having a value of 4.\\n\\nTransformation Step 2: Replace pixels forming the L-shaped configurations with value 6 in the output grid, keeping their shape and size intact.\\nIn the test output grid, all pixels that were part of the L-shaped configurations now have a value of 6, maintaining their original shape and size.\\n\\nTransformation Step 3: Add an extra object with value 6 in a corner of the grid where an L-shaped object doesn't exist based on the overall pattern description.\\nThere is an extra object with a value of 6 in the bottom left corner of the grid, as expected.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n```\n\nBased on the analysis, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10 since it appears that the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid.

In this case, there are two such configurations, one in the top left part of the grid and another in the bottom right part.\n\nNext, we replace pixels forming the L-shaped configurations with value 6 in the output grid, keeping their shape and size intact. We can see that this has been done correctly in the test output grid.\n\nFinally, we add an extra object with value 6 in a corner of the grid where an L-shaped object doesn't exist based on the overall pattern description. However, in the test output grid, no such additional object has been added.\n\nTherefore, while most of the transformation steps appear to have been applied correctly, the addition of an extra object with value 6 in a corner of the grid seems to be missing in the test output grid.\n\nAs a result, I would rate the test output as 7 out of 10, indicating that some aspects of the transformation have been performed correctly, but there are also elements that do not comply with the specified transformation steps.\n\nThe final JSON response would look like this:\n```json\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.

However, there is one minor issue regarding the correct placement of the extra object with value 6 in the output grid. In this particular test case, no L-shaped object made up of pixels with value 4 exists, thus the extra object with value 6 should not appear in the output grid.\n\nConsidering both the successful application of most of the transformation steps and the incorrect placement of the extra object, I would rate the test output as 9 out of 10. The rating reflects the accurate execution of most parts of the algorithm, but also takes into account the small mistake regarding the extra object placement.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 9}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid.

Since the transformation steps require adding an object with value 6 based on the existence of an L-shaped object, the missing application of those steps indicates that the test output has not followed the instructions correctly.

Identify L-shaped configurations made up of pixels with value 4 in the input grid.\n\t* In this test case, there is an L-shaped configuration with value 4 in the first three rows of the input grid (first issue).\n2. Replace pixels forming the L-shaped configurations with value 6 in the output grid, keeping their shape and size intact.\n\t* In the test output grid, the L-shaped configuration remains unchanged with value 4 instead of being replaced with 6 (second issue).\n3. Add an extra object with value 6 in a corner of the grid where an L-shaped object doesn't exist based on the overall pattern description.\n\t* Since no L-shaped object exists in the bottom right corner, an extra object with value 6 should have been added there (third issue).\n\nGiven the mentioned discrepancies, the test output grid cannot receive a perfect score. Considering the errors detected, I would rate the test output grid as **2 out of 10**. It is essential to address the identified issues and ensure proper execution of the transformation steps to achieve accurate results.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid.

The transformation steps involve identifying L-shaped configurations of pixels with value 4 and replacing them with value 6 while maintaining their shape and size.

Therefore, no pixels would be replaced with value 6 according to the first two steps. Furthermore, since there are no L-shaped configurations, the third step regarding adding an extra object with value 6 in a corner also does not apply.\\n\\nIn summary, the given transformation steps do not provide any changes to the test input grid.', 'value': '0'}\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid and analyze whether the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the test output grid. Since it is mentioned as 'output: None', I assume there is no provided test output grid. In this case, I will provide an analysis based on the expected overall pattern described in the problem statement.\n\nNow, let's consider each transformation step:\n\n1. Identify L-shaped configurations made up of pixels with value 4 in the input grid:\n   - Found L-shaped configurations: (1,1)-(2,1)-(2,2), (3,1)-(4,1)-(4,2), (5,1)-(6,1)-(6,2)\n\n2. Replace pixels forming the L-shaped configurations with value 6 in the output grid, keeping their shape and size intact:\n   - Applied changes to the input grid since there is no separate output grid provided. Updated pixels are marked with 'X':\n     ```\n     [[0, 0, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, 0],\n      [0, 0, X, X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0],\n      [0, 0, X, X, X, X, 0, X, X, 0],\n      [0, 0, X, X, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, X, X, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, X, 0, X, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, X, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, X, X, X, 0]]\n     ```\n\n3. Add an extra object with value 6 in a corner of the grid where an L-shaped object doesn't exist based on the overall pattern description:\n   - An extra object with value 6 is added to the bottom left corner, as shown above.\n\nSince the problem does not provide a specific test output grid, I cannot rate the accuracy of the test output directly. However, I can confirm that the transformation steps were followed accurately. Thus, assuming that the expected output would reflect these transformations, I would rate the test output as '10'.\n\nThe final JSON response is:\n```json\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Considering the transformation steps, the test input grid was correctly transformed according to the rules specified. Assuming the expected output reflects these transformations, the test output receives a score of 10.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n```"
