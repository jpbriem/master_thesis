#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to describe the given input and output grids.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'objects': {'Example_1': {'input': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the input grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns', 'output': 'regarding the first example, describe all pixels in the output grid, focusing on pixel coordinates and patterns'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}, 'description': {'input': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within input grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical input grid shows pixels that..."', 'output': 'summarize your findings to highlight commonalities within output grids by completing the following sentence: "A typical output grid shows pixels that..."'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

    "output_analysis": "The description accurately captures certain aspects of the output, such as symmetry and the presence of connected components within solid-colored regions.

description:
input: A typical input grid demonstrates a variety of pixel arrangements, including solid rectangles with uniform pixel values interspersed with regions containing irregularly distributed pixel values and sometimes bordering each other. These elements may exhibit symmetrical distributions throughout the grid.
output: In contrast, a typical output grid showcases more organized structures compared to the inputs. These often include symmetrical layouts and alternate patterns involving various pixel values, resulting in well-defined and structured visualizations.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

------
 Here is the evaluation of the given descriptions for each example:

Example\_1:
input\_analysis: The description covers the general arrangement of pixels with horizontal bands of 8's and clusters of 5's. However, it does not mention the presence of a small rectangle of 0's surrounded by 8's. Additionally, the description fails to capture the specific positioning of the 5's in relation to the 0's.
output\_analysis: The description accurately captures the main features of the output grid, including the simple geometric configuration of horizontal bands and the placement of a few scattered pixels of 5's.
value: 7

Example\_2:
input\_analysis: The description adequately covers the input grid, highlighting the dominant horizontal bands, rectangles, and scattered pixels of 5's. It also mentions the symmetry present in the input grid.
output\_analysis: The description for the output grid matches the general structure but falls short in describing the exact number of horizontally placed 5's and their positions relative to other colored pixels.
value: 8

Example\_3:
input\_analysis: The description effectively summarizes this input grid, accounting for the dominant horizontal bands, rectangles, and scattered pixels of 5's. It leaves out the information about the isolated occurrences of 5's.
output\_analysis: Similarly to previous examples, the description misses the exact number and location of scattered pixels or groups of color 5's.
value: 7

In summary, the provided descriptions give an accurate overview of the primary patterns presented in these input-output pairs while overlooking certain details. The value for each example ranges from 6 to 8 (out of 10) due to missing specifics on the positioning and count of certain pixel clusters.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.

Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the objects in the input and output grids, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number', 'parts_of_interest': 'regarding the transformation from input to output, describe the parts of interest of the input grid (e.g. a pixel pattern or objects) and explain their importance; be specific and describe the parts appropriately (position, color, shape, size, count, symmetry, etc.)'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do pixels or objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs based only on the input. Specify WHAT changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:

	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form solid blocks or lines of specific colors (usually 8), interspersed with gaps or areas of color 0. Smaller clusters of pixels (usually color 5) may appear within or near these larger structures.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that create more complex structures using specific colors (usually 5). These structures include squares, borders, and distinct groups, exhibiting symmetries and alignments throughout.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when the color 8 comes in contact with color 0. The change depends on whether color 8 forms a continuous block or multiple separated blocks.
overall pattern: When the color 8 touches color 0, the color 5 emerges, originating from the border between both colors. Its expansion follows certain patterns depending on the arrangement of colors 8 and 0: forming a square if color 8 forms a single connected block, creating a plus sign when color 8 has two parallel sides in contact with color 0, and generating an hourglass shape if color 8 consists of two well-separated blocks.

Value Outputs:
 Here is the evaluation of the given pattern based on the provided examples:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer only to the input, specifically pixels with color 8 coming in contact with color 0. However, there is no mention of how this condition is relevant to determining the changes.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern seems to describe the transformation from input to output accurately. It explains the appearance of color 5 resulting from the interaction between color 8 and color 0, forming various shapes such as squares, plus signs, and hourglasses.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern appears to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output by considering the configuration of color 8 and color 0, but without concrete rules, applying it to other cases might require additional interpretation.",
    "value": 7
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": 7
  }
}
```

Overall, while the given conditions do apply to the input and seem relevant for the transformation, they lack clarity on their relevance in determining the changes. Moreover, the description of the pattern covers most aspects of the transformation, though applying it precisely requires understanding of various configurations between colors 8 and 0. Thus, I would rate the provided pattern a 7 out of 10 due to ambiguities and room for improvement.
------
 Here's the JSON format evaluation of the given pattern based on the three examples provided:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given conditions for Example_1 are relevant since they describe how pixels change when color 8 comes in contact with color 0, which is the key to this transformation.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output for Example_1 by providing clear rules about how color 5 appears depending on the arrangement of colors 8 and 0.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output for Example_1 because it provides specific rules for various scenarios involving color 8 and 0 arrangements.",
    "value": 9 // Given the detailed and accurate description of the transformation process, I would rate the pattern highly for Example_1.
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the given conditions are relevant for Example_2 due to their focus on the interaction between colors 8 and 0, leading to the formation of color 5.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern correctly explains the transformation from input to output for Example_2 with its straightforward rule governing the creation of color 5.",
    "precision_analysis": "Given the simple nature of the input in Example_2, the overall pattern demonstrates sufficient precision to generate an appropriate output.",
    "value": 8 // Since the transformation in this case is simpler than Example_1, I would rate the pattern slightly lower but still positively for Example_2.
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "As before, the given conditions remain relevant to Example_3, focusing on interactions between colors 8 and 0 resulting in the appearance of color 5.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern continues to accurately depict the relationship between input and output for Example_3. It successfully illustrates how the positioning of color 8 impacts the final layout of color 5.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern remains precise in describing the transformation from the given input of Example_3 to the expected output.",
    "value": 9 // Overall, the given pattern effectively outlines the transformation rules and continues to demonstrate high accuracy and precision.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, I will analyze the relationship between the input and output grids for each example and provide ratings for the precision and correctness of the overall pattern.

Example\_1:
{'conditions\_analysis': 'The given description does not explicitly mention any conditions related to the input grid. However, it infers that smaller clusters of pixels (color 5) may appear within or near larger structures, and the task involves changing certain colors while preserving symmetry and alignment.',
'overall\_pattern\_analysis': 'The overall pattern appears to involve finding and modifying specific patterns in the input grid based on their geometric properties, such as symmetries and alignments, without explicitly referring to a fixed rule set.',
'precision\_analysis': 'Considering the complexity and apparent randomness of the modifications, the overall pattern seems insufficiently precise to generate the exact output for a novel input grid.',
'value': 6}

Example\_2:
{'conditions\_analysis': 'Similar to Example\_1, there are no explicit conditions mentioned in the description. It suggests that small clusters of pixels (color 5) may be present within or near larger structures, and the desired result includes altering certain colors while maintaining symmetries and alignments.',
'overall\_pattern\_analysis': 'The overall pattern resembles applying geometrical principles like reflecting, rotating, or resizing parts of the input grid selectively, according to predefined criteria.',
'precision\_analysis': 'Given the intricate nature of the color conversions, the overall pattern lacks precision in predicting the outcome for a fresh input grid.',
'value': 6}

Example\_3:
{'conditions\_analysis': 'As in previous instances, the description omits specifying direct conditions pertinent to the input grid. It implies that small clusters of pixels (color 5) may emerge within or close to bigger structures, requiring alterations adhering to geometrical rules.',
'overall\_pattern\_analysis': 'The overall pattern entails applying geometrical principles, including reflections, rotations, and adaptable pattern recognition, governed by implicit rules that affect specific regions in the input grid.',
'precision\_analysis': 'Considering the subtlety and seemingly arbitrary color modifications, the overall pattern falls short in providing enough precision to deduce the expected output for a unique input grid.',
'value': 6}

In summary, the overall pattern fails to exhibit sufficient precision to anticipate the required transformations accurately when dealing with previously unseen data. Still, the presence of geometrical principles ensures a decent level of consistency across examples. Given this analysis, assigning an average value rating across the three examples seems appropriate.
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given pattern based on the provided examples:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given condition about specific colors (8 and 5) is mentioned in the description but not used in determining the changes in this example. However, the concept of connectedness is relevant for this example.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The given overall pattern does not describe the transformation from input to output for this example. There are no explicit rules mentioned except for identifying certain colors and their positions.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern is not precise enough to transform a new input to its output, because there are no clear rules defined beyond recognizing patterns.",
    "value": "3"
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example 1, the conditions specified do not directly apply to this example. Although colors (8 and 5) are identified, the role they play in the transformation process remains unclear.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Again, the given overall pattern fails to capture the essence of the transformation seen in this example due to the absence of precise rules.",
    "precision_analysis": "The lack of clear rules makes the pattern imprecise when attempting to generate an output for a new input.",
    "value": "3"
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "As before, the stated conditions are insufficiently applied to this particular example. Identifying colors alone doesn't sufficiently characterize the required transformation.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The given overall pattern still lacks precision and applicability to deduce the relationship between the given input and output.",
    "precision_analysis": "With ambiguous rules, the pattern falls short of providing accurate guidance for generating a new output from an input.",
    "value": "3"
  }
}
```

In summary, the given overall pattern struggles to accurately represent the connection between the input and output grids across the various examples. It lacks both precision and clear relevant conditions necessary for a successful mapping of new inputs to their expected outputs.

In summary, without a clear overall pattern, I cannot provide a thorough evaluation of the given pattern's ability to describe the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Additionally, due to the lack of precision in the description, it is difficult to assess whether the given pattern would be effective in transforming new inputs to their desired outputs.
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given pattern based on the provided input-output pairs and description:

Example\_1:
{'conditions\_analysis': 'The given condition does not explicitly refer to the input, but it is clear from the context that the transformation depends solely on the position and value of the elements in the input.\nRelevant conditions such as identifying blocks of specific colors (8) and smaller clusters (5) are applicable and help determine the changes.',
'overall\_pattern\_analysis': 'Although there is no explicit overall pattern provided, we can observe a consistent replacement pattern where certain blocks of color (8) are replaced by patterns containing the target color (5) while maintaining symmetry.\nThis implies that the overall pattern could be described as identifying and replacing block configurations with their corresponding symmetric replacements containing the target color.',
'precision\_analysis': 'Since the overall pattern relies on identifying shapes and applying transformations based on those shapes, precision will depend heavily on proper shape identification. As long as the algorithm accurately detects and categorizes shapes in the input, the transformation process should yield accurate results.',
'value': 8}

Example\_2:
{...}

Unfortunately, I am unable to provide evaluations for Example\_2 and Example\_3 due to the lack of information about the overall pattern relating them to the given description. To perform a complete assessment, additional context or a clearer connection between the provided description and the remaining examples would be necessary.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that form solid blocks or lines of specific colors (usually 8), interspersed with gaps or areas of color 0. Smaller clusters of pixels (usually color 5) may appear within or near these larger structures.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that create more complex structures using specific colors (usually 5). These structures include squares, borders, and distinct groups, exhibiting symmetries and alignments throughout.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixel or object changes occur when there exists an isolated group of pixels with a specific value (usually 5) in the input grid.
overall pattern: For any given input grid, if there exist separated clusters or pixels of a unique value (commonly 5), they will merge and connect to each other, creating larger and more intricate structures in the output grid. This process results in the dissolution of smaller constituent structures and the emergence of expanded, contiguous ones. In essence, the pixel value found in isolated clusters serves as a catalyst for structure formation in the output grid.

There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixel or object changes depend on the presence of color 5. Horizontal connections among these pixels lead to a solid band, influencing surrounding pixels to take on the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input grid containing pixels or objects with color 5, search for patterns where these elements connect horizontally. Simultaneously, identify areas affected by the transformation, leading to a wider band of color 5 accompanied by changes in the surrounding pixels.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change according to their color (5) and position within the grid. Input grids typically display more complex arrangements of pink or yellow pixels, while output grids feature simpler compositions of these colors.
overall pattern: The input grids contain pink or yellow pixels organized in intricate patterns. During the transformation, these highlighted pixels migrate towards a corner determined by their color (pink moves diagonally to the bottom right corner, while yellow moves towards the top left corner), leading to simplified configurations of these colors in the output grids.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.

There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.


overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels or objects change when they are part of the initial color 5 regions in the input grids. This change depends on the position and connectivity of these pixels, as well as their proximity to other color 5 pixels.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, identify any connected regions consisting of color 5 pixels. Replace each connected region with a larger connected region made up of color 5 pixels in the output grid. All pixels neighboring these new regions will become color 0. The relative placement and orientation of the original color 5 regions determine the final arrangement of the connected regions in the output grid.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Here's the evaluation of the given pattern based on the three provided examples:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes. The presence of color 5 and its connectivity play a crucial role in determining how the output grid is formed.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output for this example. It captures the idea of identifying connected regions of color 5 and replacing them with a larger connected region while turning neighbors into color 0.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output by specifying the conditions under which pixels or objects change. However, there could be more specific rules about how large the new connected region should be and how its placement and orientation depend on the original regions.",
    "value": "8"
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": "8"
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": "7"
  }
}
```

In general, the given overall pattern seems to capture the essence of the relationship between the input and output grids; however, depending on the exact implementation, there might be slight variations in how the new connected regions are placed and oriented. Therefore, I gave a value of 8 for Examples 1 and 2 but a slightly lower value of 7 for Example 3 due to minor differences in the output compared to the expected result.

 Here's the evaluation of the given pattern based on the three examples provided:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer specifically to the presence of color 5 regions in the input grids, which aligns with the input grids given. However, the relevance of the conditions to determining the changes could be more explicitly stated.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output by identifying connected regions of color 5 pixels and replacing them with larger connected regions while turning neighboring pixels to color 0.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern seems precise enough to transform a new input to its output, but there is room for improvement in specifying how the size and placement of the new connected regions are determined.",

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": 8
  }
}
```

Overall, the given pattern is mostly accurate and provides a good starting point for understanding the transformation process. However, it lacks precision in certain areas, particularly in describing how the new connected regions are formed and positioned. To improve the pattern, consider providing more specific rules for generating the output grids, including details about the connection rules for creating larger connected regions and the influence of neighboring pixels on the output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixel or object changes depend on the presence of color 5. Horizontal connections among these pixels lead to a solid band, influencing surrounding pixels to take on the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input grid containing pixels or objects with color 5, search for patterns where these elements connect horizontally. Simultaneously, identify areas affected by the transformation, leading to a wider band of color 5 accompanied by changes in the surrounding pixels.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.

Value Outputs:
 Here's the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Regarding the first example, there are no explicit transformation steps provided. Based on the description and comparison of input and output grids, we observe that color 5 pixels expand horizontally and convert connected 8 pixels into 0 pixels. This results in simpler geometric structures.",
    "value": 7
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Regarding the second example, there are no explicit transformation steps provided. By analyzing the input and output grids, we find that color 5 pixels grow horizontally while converting connected 8 pixels into 0 pixels, leading to simpler geometrical arrangements.",
    "value": 7
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Regarding the third example, there are no explicit transformation steps provided. However, by examining the input and output grids, we notice that color 5 pixels extend horizontally, turning connected 8 pixels into 0 pixels, thus creating simpler geometrical forms.",
    "value": 7
  }
}
```

In the above evaluation, I gave a general value of 7 for all examples since the transformation steps were not explicitly provided. The value reflects the fact that the high-level description matches the observed changes in input-output grids but lacks specific step-by-step instructions for verifying accuracy.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.



transformation steps: ['1. Identify connected pixels with color 5 that have at least one side without any color 0 pixels.', '2. Create a continuous horizontal band using these identified pixels with color 5.', '3. Change the color of the newly created horizontal band to 5.', '4. Convert all pixels to color 0 around this new band, but exclude the pixels that originally had color 8 and formed horizontal lines surrounded by color 0 pixels.']

Value Outputs:
 Here's the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

Example_1:
transformation\_analysis: Regarding the first example, the transformation steps do not correctly transform the input grid into its output grid. While step 2 creates a continuous horizontal band of 5 correctly, step 3 changes the color of the newly created horizontal band back to 5 instead of 8. Additionally, step 4 does not seem to convert the correct set of pixels to 0 since there are still non-zero pixels left near the edges of the original 5 regions.
value: 3

Example_2:
transformation\_analysis: For the second example, the transformation steps again fail to accurately transform the input grid into its output grid. Similar to Example_1, step 3 changes the color of the newly created horizontal band to 5 instead of 8. Step 4 fails to convert the correct set of pixels to 0 as well, leaving more complex structures than intended.
value: 4

Example_3:
transformation\_analysis: As observed previously, the transformation steps fail to produce the desired output grid. Step 3 sets the color of the newly created horizontal band to 5 instead of 8, and step 4 has issues properly identifying the pixels to convert to 0. This results in a more intricate structure compared to the target output grid.
value: 4

A critical assessment of the provided transformation steps suggests inconsistencies in applying the described process across the examples, specifically concerning changing the color of horizontal bands (step 3) and converting the correct set of pixels to 0 (step 4). To improve the transformation steps, consider addressing these two aspects while maintaining consistency in applying the rules throughout the examples.
------
 Here's the evaluation of the given transformation steps for each example:

Example\_1:
transformation\_analysis: Regarding the first example, there seems to be an issue with step 2. The identified pixels with color 5 do not necessarily create a continuous horizontal band as described, resulting in incorrect output. Additionally, step 3 appears unnecessary, since no changes occur in the provided input-output pair. Step 4 has some discrepancies too; while converting pixels to color 0 works fine, it doesn't properly exclude pixels that originally had color 8 and were part of horizontal lines surrounded by color 0 pixels.
value: 3

Example\_2:
transformation\_analysis: For the second example, the transformation steps seem to work well. They result in a correct identification and manipulation of the pixels with color 5, forming a continuous horizontal band and converting appropriate pixels to color 0.
value: 8

Example\_3:
transformation\_analysis: Similar to Example\_1, the third example faces issues in step 2 and step 4. The creation of a continuous horizontal band (step 2) isn't accurate, leading to improper conversion of pixels to color 0 in step 4.
value: 3

These evaluations conclude the analysis for the given transformation steps across the three examples.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:

Explanation:

In Example_1, the transformation steps are accurate but lack precision. For instance, step 1 does not specify how many horizontally consecutive 8's constitute a region, nor does it clarify what qualifies as 'horizontally across the grid'. Step 2 omits mentioning the requirement for color 0 pixels to be directly beneath the color 5 pixels. Despite these ambiguities, the steps do lead to the correct output because there is only one way to interpret them in this context.

In Example_2, the transformation steps work perfectly since there is only one interpretation for each step.

In Example_3, however, the steps fail to produce the desired result due to their vague nature. This example highlights the importance of clear definitions in the steps, especially considering real-world applications where ambiguity could lead to significant errors.

overall pattern: Given an input grid containing pixels or objects with color 5, search for patterns where these elements connect horizontally. Simultaneously, identify areas affected by the transformation, leading to a wider band of color 5 accompanied by changes in the surrounding pixels.

Without specific transformation steps, I cannot critically assess whether the described pattern is accurately implemented in each example. It's essential to provide concrete transformation rules to allow for proper evaluation.

 Here's the evaluation of the given transformation steps in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Regarding the first example, there are no explicit transformation steps provided. Based on comparing the input and output grids, it appears that when pixels with value 5 form a horizontal line (or close to horizontal), they transform into a wider band of connected pixels with value 5. Additionally, surrounding pixels change to match this new pattern.",
    "value": 7
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, there are no explicit transformation steps provided. In this case, when pixels with value 5 form a horizontal line (or close to horizontal) near the bottom of the grid, they transform into a wider band of connected pixels with value 5. Surrounding pixels change to match this new pattern.",
    "value": 7
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "transformation_analysis": "Again, there are no explicit transformation steps provided. When pixels with value 5 form two separate horizontal lines (or close to horizontal) near the bottom of the grid, they transform into a single wider band of connected pixels with value 5. Surrounding pixels change to match this new pattern.",
    "value": 7
  }
}
```

While the transformation steps field was empty, I analyzed the transformation pattern based on the description and overall pattern. The transformation occurs when pixels with value 5 form (close to) horizontal lines, resulting in a wider band of connected pixels with value 5, along with changes in surrounding pixels. Due to the lack of specific transformation steps, my evaluations were based solely on observing the differences between input and output grids. Consider providing more detailed transformation steps for further accuracy in future assignments.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixel or object changes depend on the presence of color 5. Horizontal connections among these pixels lead to a solid band, influencing surrounding pixels to take on the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input grid containing pixels or objects with color 5, search for patterns where these elements connect horizontally. Simultaneously, identify areas affected by the transformation, leading to a wider band of color 5 accompanied by changes in the surrounding pixels.



transformation steps: ['1. Identify any continuous horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of pixels with color 5.', '2. Expand the lines or groups of pixels with color 5 vertically and horizontally by changing the color of adjacent pixels.', '3. Set the color of all non-zero pixels not connected to the expanded lines or groups to 0.']

}

Here's my analysis for each example:

Example_1:
1. The transformation steps accurately identify continuous horizontal lines of pixels with color 5. However, it fails to recognize diagonal or vertical lines. In this case, there are no such lines, so it doesn't impact the result.
2. Expanding the lines or groups of pixels with color 5 works well but results in a slightly narrower band of color 5 compared to the target output. This step needs improvement.
3. Setting the color of all non-zero pixels not connected to the expanded lines or groups to 0 works fine, creating the desired horizontal band of color 5.

Example_2:
1. This example has no continuous horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines of pixels with color 5. Instead, we have two separate groups of pixels. The transformation steps handle this situation adequately.
2. Expanding the lines or groups of pixels with color 5 works well and creates a more accurate band of color 5 compared to Example_1.
3. As before, setting the color of all non-zero pixels not connected to the expanded lines or groups to 0 gives the correct output.

Example_3:
1. Similar to Example_2, this example contains two separate groups of pixels with color 5 without forming any lines. The transformation steps perform satisfactorily here too.
2. Expanding the lines or groups of pixels with color 5 successfully forms a wide enough band of color 5 while maintaining other aspects of the grid.
3. Again, setting the color of all non-zero pixels not connected to the expanded lines or groups to 0 produces the correct result.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.', '2. Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.', '3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.', '4. Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5. Since there are no other color 8 regions in the grid except for the outer boundary and inner nested rectangles, we keep the existing color 8 pixels unchanged.\n\

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given example input-output pairs with respective descriptions.
Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'describe the test input grid and identify all objects and pixel pattern', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps to the test input grid, detailing how each condition of the transformation rules applies to the current task and respond to every step in detail.', 'transformation_result': 'describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.', 'output': 'return only the resulting test output grid as numpy array'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixel or object changes depend on the presence of color 5. Horizontal connections among these pixels lead to a solid band, influencing surrounding pixels to take on the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input grid containing pixels or objects with color 5, search for patterns where these elements connect horizontally. Simultaneously, identify areas affected by the transformation, leading to a wider band of color 5 accompanied by changes in the surrounding pixels.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify connected components of color 5.', '2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components.', '3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5.', '4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or are part of the expanded color 5 zones.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's analyze the problem and perform the requested transformation. We will describe the input, apply the transformation steps, and present the output.

First, we will provide a description of the test input grid and identify objects and pixel patterns.

```json
"input_description": "The test input grid consists of three main regions separated horizontally by rows of zeros (0). The uppermost region has alternating columns of 8 and 0. Beneath this section are two regions with stripes of 8 bordered by vertical lines of 0. In the lower right corner of the grid, there are two sets of neighboring 5s."
```

Next, we will iterate through the transformation steps and describe how they apply to the current task.

Step 1: Identify connected components of color 5
```json
"transformation": "We look for connected components consisting solely of color 5 pixels. Here, we find two such components located in the bottom-right corner of the input grid."
```

Step 2: Check for any horizontal connections within the components
```json
"transformation": "Examining the first component of 5s, we observe no horizontal connections. Similarly, analyzing the second component of 5s confirms no horizontal connections. As a result, both components remain disconnected without forming a solid band."
```

Step 3: Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5
```json
"transformation": "Since neither of the two components exhibits horizontal connections, expanding them vertically does not apply in this scenario."
```

Step 4: Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or were part of the expanded color 5 zones
```json
"transformation": "As previous steps did not reveal any changes to the grid, updating surrounding pixels isn't required here."
```

Now, we will describe the resulting pixel pattern or objects in the test output grid.

```json
"transformation_result": "No changes occurred in the input grid due to none of the conditions triggering transformations. Therefore, the output grid remains identical to the original input grid."
```

Finally, return the resulting test output grid as a NumPy array.

```python
import numpy as np
test_case = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],

As described in the `transformation_result`, since there were no horizontal connections among the color 5 regions, no expansion or pixel update took place, so the output remains the same as the input.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid according to the given transformation steps:

1. Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.
   - This condition appears to be met. The two groups of color 5 pixels are surrounded by color 0 pixels.

2. Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.
   - This condition is met for both groups of color 5 pixels. To the left and right of each group, there are horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8.

3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.
   - This step seems to be partially incorrect. While the horizontal lines of color 8 have been extended downwards using color 5, no pixels between these lines have been changed. Therefore, this step has not been fully applied.

4. Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.
   - It's unclear what constitutes the original group since it wasn't specified in previous steps. However, we do see that non-group pixels of color 5 in the bottom row have been changed to color 0, so part of this step has been applied correctly.

Given the observations made during our evaluation, it seems like some errors occurred while applying the transformation steps. Due to the partial application of certain steps and incorrect implementation of others, I would rate the test output as a 6 out of 10. Improvement in understanding and adherence to the instructions is needed.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid according to the given transformation steps:

1. Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.
   - This condition is met, as there are two separate groups of connected pixels with color 5 (in the bottom right corner), both surrounded by pixels with color 0.

2. Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.
   - This condition is met. The pixels with color 8 directly below the first group of connected pixels with color 5 form a horizontal line. Similarly, the pixels with color 8 above and below the second group of connected pixels with color 5 form horizontal lines.

3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.
   - We see no changes made to pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines. Therefore, it seems like this step has not been executed properly.

4. Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.
   - Since step 3 wasn't carried out correctly, this step cannot be evaluated accurately.

Due to incorrect implementation of transformation step 3, it appears that the given test output grid doesn't match the desired outcome after applying all the transformation rules. With this analysis, I would rate the test output quality as 3 out of 10 since only parts of the initial conditions were fulfilled but without proper execution of the transformation itself.

Value Outputs:
 To evaluate the test output grid, we will consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.

Transformation Step 1: Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.
In the test input grid, there are two separate groups of connected pixels with color 5, both surrounded by pixels with color 0. This condition is satisfied, so no issues here.

Transformation Step 2: Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.
There is a horizontal line of connected pixels with color 8 above and below the first group of connected pixels with color 5. For the second group of connected pixels with color 5, there is also a horizontal line of connected pixels with color 8 above it but none below it. Although this does not perfectly match Step 2, we can still proceed with the rest of the evaluation.

Transformation Step 3: Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.
Pixels between and including the horizontal lines of color 8 around the first group of connected pixels with color 5 have been changed to color 5 appropriately. However, only pixels between the horizontal line of color 8 above the second group and the edge of the grid have been changed to color 5; pixels below the second group remain unchanged as color 0 instead of changing to color 5. This is incorrect according to Step 3.

Transformation Step 4: Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.
No additional pixels of color 5 appear in the test output grid beyond the original groups present in the test input grid, so this step seems to have been followed correctly.

Overall, while most transformation steps seem to have been followed, there is an issue in Step 3 regarding the application of changes to pixels of color 0 near the second group of connected pixels with color 5. Due to this inconsistency, I cannot give a high rating for the accuracy of applying the transformation steps.

------
 Based on the analysis of the provided transformation steps and comparison with the test input and output grids, here's the evaluation:

The transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Below is a breakdown of how each step affected the test output grid:

1. Connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0 are identified: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`.
2. Neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group with connected pixels of color 8 above or below them are examined: `[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]]`.
3. Pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) are changed to color 5: `[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]]` becomes `[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 8, 8, 0, 0]]`.
4. Remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group are converted to color 0: `[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 8, 8, 0, 0]]` remains unchanged.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.', '2. Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.', '3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.', '4. Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.']

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the provided transformation steps and comparing the input and output grids, it seems like there was no change made to the test input grid during the transformation process, as the test output grid matches exactly with the original input grid. Here's the evaluation:

```json
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.",
  "value": 0
}
```

Since the output grid has remained unchanged after applying the given transformation steps, I would rate the accuracy of the test output as 0 out of 10.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid against the given transformation steps.

The test input grid is:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
And the test output grid is:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Now, let's go through the transformation steps and compare them with the test output grid:

1. Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.
   - There are two connected pixels of color 5 at `[8,4]` and `[8,5]`, and they are indeed surrounded by pixels with color 0. So far so good.

2. Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.
   - Above and below the identified pixels of color 5, there are multiple horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8. This is consistent with the test output grid.

3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.
   - Comparing the test input and output grids, no pixels of color 0 have been changed to color 5. It seems like this step has not been followed correctly.

4. Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.
   - Since step 3 hasn't been executed properly, it would be difficult to judge the correctness of this final step. But considering the results so far, we cannot say that this step has been performed accurately.

Given our evaluation, it appears that some of the transformation steps were not carried out correctly. As a result, I cannot provide a high rating for this test output grid. Therefore, the answer is:
```json
{"test_output_analysis": "Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.", "value": 3}
```

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixels tend to change when they meet certain criteria related to their color, position, and neighbors. In this case, neighboring pixels with color 0 determine whether connected pixels with color 5 should become a continuous band or stay separated.
overall pattern: Given an input grid, search for pixels with color 8 organized in horizontal patterns. These regions indicate where the color 5 pixels will form new continuous horizontal bands in the output grid. Pixels surrounding these areas will be converted to color 0, simplifying the overall structure.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0.', '2. Examine the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them.', '3. Change pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5.', '4. Convert all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the provided transformation steps and comparing the test input grid with the test output grid, here's the evaluation:

The transformation starts by identifying connected pixels of color 5 surrounded by pixels with color 0 (step 1). In the test input grid, there are two groups of color 5 pixels meeting this condition: one at the bottom left corner (coordinates [8, 7] and [8, 8]) and another at the bottom right corner (coordinates [9, 7] and [9, 8]).

Next, the algorithm examines the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them (step 2). For both groups of color 5 pixels, there are indeed horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 both above and below.

Then, the algorithm changes pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5 (step 3). This results in extending the horizontal lines towards the original color 5 pixels. However, in the test output grid, all zeros between the color 8 pixels were changed to color 5, including areas beyond the detected horizontal lines. It seems like the implementation interpreted "between" more liberally than expected, covering a broader area than just the pixels located strictly between the lines of color 8.

Lastly, the algorithm converts all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0 (step 4). But in the test output grid, all remaining pixels of color 5 (the ones that didn't satisfy step 1) remained unchanged, although they should have been switched to color 0 as specified in the last step.

Considering the discrepancies mentioned above, it's clear that some parts of the instructions weren't adhered to accurately during the transformation process. Therefore, I cannot provide a perfect score. Instead, I would rate the test output grid as a 3 out of 10 due to significant deviations from the expected outcomes.

 Based on the analysis of the provided transformation steps and comparison of the test input grid with the test output grid, here's the evaluation:

The transformation starts by identifying connected pixels of color 5 that are surrounded by pixels with color 0 (step 1). In the test input grid, there are two groups of color 5 pixels satisfying this condition: one at the bottom right corner and another at the top right corner.

Next, the algorithm examines the neighboring pixels of the identified color 5 group for horizontal lines of connected pixels with color 8 above or below them (step 2). For both groups of color 5 pixels, there are indeed horizontal lines of color 8 pixels above and below them.

Then, the algorithm changes pixels of color 0 between the detected horizontal lines of color 8 (including the lines) to color 5 (step 3). This results in connecting the initial color 5 pixels horizontally. Comparing the test input grid to the test output grid reveals that this step has been carried out correctly.

Finally, the algorithm converts all remaining pixels of color 5 that were not originally part of the group to color 0 (step 4). This ensures that no isolated color 5 pixels remain. By comparing the test input grid with the test output grid, it appears that this final step has not been executed since there are still isolated color 5 pixels present. It seems like the test output grid contains errors regarding this last transformation step.

As a result, I would rate the test output grid as 7 out of 10 due to inconsistencies in applying the complete set of rules. To improve the score, ensure consistent application of all transformation steps.#############################

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output for the given test input grid using the specified transformation steps. Since no potential test output grid has been provided, I will assume that we need to determine whether the described transformation should result in any changes to the input grid.

Given transformation steps:
1. Identify connected components of color 5.
2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components.
3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5.
4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or are part of the expanded color 5 zones.

Examining the test input grid, it contains two separate connected components of color 5 without any horizontal connections (step 2) between them. Therefore, none of the components would expand vertically (step 3). As a result, no updates would occur for surrounding pixels (step 4), and the grid remains unchanged after applying the transformation steps.

Since the given test input grid is unaffected by the transformation process, we consider the output to be correct for this particular test case. However, keep in mind that evaluating whether the transformation steps themselves are complete or accurate wasn't possible due to missing reference outputs for comparison.

Output JSON format answer:
{
  'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each transformation step, the test input grid does not require any modifications since it does not contain connected components of color 5 with horizontal connections.',
  'value': '10'
}
------
 Based on the provided information, I will evaluate the test case considering each transformation step and provide a rating out of 10 for the test output.

Transformation step analysis:

1. Identify connected components of color 5.
   - In the test input grid, two connected components of color 5 are identified: one component consisting of four pixels (two rows, two columns) at position [8,6] to [9,7]; another component with two pixels (one row, two columns) at position [8,8] to [9,9]. This step has been executed correctly.

2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components.
   - For both components, there are no horizontal connections since they don't extend beyond a single row. This step has been executed correctly.

3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5.
   - Since there are no horizontal connections present in any of the components, this step doesn't apply to the test input grid. The existing components remain unchanged.

4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or are part of the expanded color 5 zones.
   - As no vertical expansion occurred in step 3, there is no need to update the surrounding pixels in this case.

Since no actual change occurs in the test input grid based on the given transformation steps, a suitable output would still be the original input grid. If the expected output is empty or `None`, it suggests that even the smallest modification invalidates the result. Thus, I cannot approve the test output based on the given criteria.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the given test output grid using the provided transformation steps, the following observations are made:

1. Identify connected components of color 5: In the test input grid, there are two connected components of color 5 (in rows 8 and 9). This has been identified correctly in the test output grid.

2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components: There are indeed horizontal connections present within both components in the test input grid. This has been identified correctly in the test output grid.

3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5: Since there are horizontal connections, the components should expand vertically forming solid bands of color 5. However, this hasn't been done in the test output grid. Both components still remain limited to their original rows, instead of expanding vertically.

4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or are part of the expanded color 5 zones: Although the vertical expansion did not occur properly, updating the surrounding pixels based on their original color could still provide insight about correct implementation. Unfortunately, no updates have been observed in the test output grid.

In summary, while the first two steps appear to be implemented correctly, the crucial third and fourth steps show inconsistencies compared to the expected outcome. It seems like the connected components haven't expanded vertically when there are horizontal connections, and the surrounding pixels haven't been updated accordingly. Therefore, the transformation seems incorrectly applied.

------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid against the given transformation steps.

First, we identify the connected components of color 5. In both the input and output grids, we see two separate components of color 5. So far, so good.

Next, we check for any horizontal connections within the components. This appears to be true for both components in the input grid (there are columns of color 5 next to columns of other color 5). However, in the output grid, the two components of color 5 do not seem to have any horizontal connection.

In step 3, we expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections. Since this condition wasn't met in step 2 for the output grid, it seems like no expansion occurred here. If we look back at our examples, none of them involved vertical expansion without horizontal connections.

Finally, in step 4, we update the surrounding pixels based on their original color. In the transition from input to output grid, regions with color 8 changed around the second component of color 5, while leaving the first component untouched. It seems unclear why one instance of color 5 was updated but not the other, especially considering neither appear to meet the stated conditions for modification.

Overall, although certain aspects align with the rules described, inconsistencies arise regarding horizontal connections and updates to surrounding pixels. Due to these discrepancies, I cannot confidently say the test output was derived using the provided transformation steps. Therefore, a low rating would be appropriate until further clarification is offered.

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid against the given transformation steps. The test input grid and output grid are identical, so we need to check if applying the transformation steps to the test input grid would result in the same output grid.

1. Identify connected components of color 5. In this case, there are two connected components of color 5 (two groups of consecutive 5s) in rows 9 and 10.

2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components. We find that both components do not have any horizontal connections since the 5s appear only in columns 4 and 5.

3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections. This step does not apply here because no horizontal connections were found in step 2.

4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately. Since no expansion occurred in step 3, there is no need for updating surrounding pixels.

After evaluating the transformation steps, it appears that no actual modifications took place during the process. Therefore, the test output grid remains unchanged compared to the initial test input grid. Considering that the expected output should show broader horizontal bands of color 5 surrounded by updated pixels, the provided transformation steps did not yield the desired outcome. Thus, I cannot approve the correct application of the transformation steps to the test input grid.

Given my analysis, I recommend a value of 1 out of 10 for the test output.

description:
input: A typical input grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in various geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be scattered pixels or groups of pixels colored 5. These elements often exhibit some degree of symmetry or regularity.
output: A typical output grid shows pixels that are predominantly colored either 8 or 0, arranged in simple geometric configurations such as horizontal bands or rectangles. There may also be a horizontal band or scattered pixels/groups of color 5. However, these elements are generally fewer and less complex than those found in the input grids.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pixel or object changes depend on the presence of color 5. Horizontal connections among these pixels lead to a solid band, influencing surrounding pixels to take on the same color.
overall pattern: Given an input grid containing pixels or objects with color 5, search for patterns where these elements connect horizontally. Simultaneously, identify areas affected by the transformation, leading to a wider band of color 5 accompanied by changes in the surrounding pixels.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify connected components of color 5.', '2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components.', '3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5.', '4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or are part of the expanded color 5 zones.']


Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output grid.

First, we analyze the transformation steps:

1. Identifying connected components of color 5 is done correctly since there are no changes made to the isolated '5' regions in the test case.
2. Checking for horizontal connections within the components is also performed accurately, as evidenced by the unaltered horizontal chains of '5'.
3. Expansion of components vertically does not happen, as indicated by the lack of vertical connections of '5'. This aligns with the correct application of this step because there are no horizontal connections for any component of '5' in the test case.
4. Updating surrounding pixels is not necessary for the test case due to the absence of horizontal connections and subsequent expansion of '5' regions.

Given the above observations, it appears that the transformation steps were indeed applied correctly to the test input grid. Therefore, our evaluation is as follows:

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each transformation step, the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': '10'}
------
 Based on the analysis of the given test output grid using the provided transformation steps, the following observations are made:

1. Identify connected components of color 5:
   - In the test input grid, two connected components of color 5 are found at coordinates ([8,4], [8,5]) and ([9,4], [9,5]).

2. Check for any horizontal connections within the components:
   - Both components do not have horizontal connections.

3. Expand the components vertically when there are horizontal connections to form solid bands of color 5:
   - Since no horizontal connections exist, this step does not apply.

4. Update the surrounding pixels appropriately based on whether they originally had color 0 or are part of the expanded color 5 zones:
   - As the previous step did not apply, this step does not apply either.

Since no actual changes occurred during the transformation process according to the given transformation steps, it appears that the test output grid was not generated through their application. Therefore, the test output can be considered incorrect with respect to the provided rules.

Based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as 0 out of 10.
