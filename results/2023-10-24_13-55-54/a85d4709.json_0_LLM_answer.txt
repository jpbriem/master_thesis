LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, the middle letter is replaced by the letter to its right, while the first and third letters remain unchanged.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

a, a, f
f, a, a
a, f, a

The output for each row would be:

1st row: a -> d
2nd row: f -> e
3rd row: a -> c

So, the test output would be:

d, e, c

Solution:
d, d, d
c, c, c
e, e, e
