LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that each letter in the input corresponds to a row of letters in the output. Specifically, it appears that each letter in the input is repeated a certain number of times in the corresponding row of the output, with the number of repetitions being determined by the number of letters in the input that are the same as the current letter.

For example, in the first train input, the letter "e" appears three times, so it is repeated three times in the corresponding row of the output. Similarly, the letter "d" appears twice, so it is repeated twice in the output.

Using this pattern, we can create a rule for generating the output from a given input. Here's one way to formalize the rule:

1. For each letter in the input, repeat it as many times as there are letters in the input that are the same as that letter.
2. Place the repeated letters in a row to form the output.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input:

test input: b, g, g

We start by applying the rule to the first letter, "b". There are two other letters in the input that are the same as "b", namely "g" and "g". Therefore, we repeat "b" twice in the output.

Next, we move on to the second letter, "g". There is only one other letter in the input that is the same as "g", namely "g". Therefore, we repeat "g" once in the output.

Finally, we come to the third letter, "g". There are still only two letters in the input that are the same as "g", namely "g" and "b". Therefore, we repeat "g" twice in the output.

The resulting output using this pattern would be:

test output: b, b, g, g, g

Therefore, the answer to the test output is b, b, g, g, g.
