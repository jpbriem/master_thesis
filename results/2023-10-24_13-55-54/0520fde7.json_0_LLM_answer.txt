LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
b, a, a, f, a, b, a
a, b, a, f, b, b, b
b, a, a, f, a, a, a
train output:
a, a, a
a, c, a
a, a, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, the first letter is repeated three times, followed by a different letter (which is sometimes the same as one of the previous letters), and then the first letter is repeated again three times.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

b, a, b, f, b, a, b
a, b, a, f, b, a, b
b, a, b, f, a, b, a

The test output would be:

a, a, a
a, c, a
a, a, c
################################################################

Solution:
c, a, c
a, a, a
a, a, a
