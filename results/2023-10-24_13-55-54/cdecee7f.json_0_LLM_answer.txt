LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, based on the position of the letter in the alphabet.

The mapping from input letters to output letters is as follows:

* 'a' becomes 'd' (4th letter becomes 4th letter)
* 'b' becomes 'e' (2nd letter becomes 5th letter)
* 'c' becomes 'f' (3rd letter becomes 6th letter)
* 'd' becomes 'g' (4th letter becomes 7th letter)
* 'e' becomes 'h' (5th letter becomes 8th letter)
* 'f' becomes 'i' (6th letter becomes 9th letter)
* 'g' becomes 'j' (7th letter becomes 10th letter)
* 'h' becomes 'k' (8th letter becomes 11th letter)
* 'i' becomes 'l' (9th letter becomes 12th letter)
* 'j' becomes'm' (10th letter becomes 13th letter)
* 'k' becomes 'n' (11th letter becomes 14th letter)
* 'l' becomes 'o' (12th letter becomes 15th letter)
*'m' becomes 'p' (13th letter becomes 16th letter)
* 'n' becomes 'q' (14th letter becomes 17th letter)
* 'o' becomes 'r' (15th letter becomes 18th letter)
* 'p' becomes's' (16th letter becomes 19th letter)
* 'q' becomes 't' (17th letter becomes 20th letter)
* 'r' becomes 'u' (18th letter becomes 21st letter)
*'s' becomes 'v' (19th letter becomes 22nd letter)
* 't' becomes 'w' (20th letter becomes 23rd letter)
* 'u' becomes 'x' (21st letter becomes 24th letter)
* 'v' becomes 'y' (22nd letter becomes 25th letter)
* 'w' becomes 'z' (23rd letter becomes 26th letter)

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

c, e, f
b, j, d
f, b, d
