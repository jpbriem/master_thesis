LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing certain cells with new values based on their current values and the values of neighboring cells.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. If there are three consecutive cells of the same value (either 'a', 'b', or 'c') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, replace the middle cell with the next value in the sequence ('a' -> 'b' -> 'c').
2. If there are two cells of the same value (either 'a' or 'c') adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, replace one of them with the opposite value.
3. If there is a cell of value 'a' surrounded by three cells of value 'c', replace the 'a' cell with 'b'.
4. If there is a cell of value 'c' surrounded by three cells of value 'a', replace the 'c' cell with 'b'.
5. If there is a cell of value 'b' surrounded by three cells of value 'a', replace the 'b' cell with 'c'.
6. If there is a cell of value 'b' surrounded by three cells of value 'c', replace the 'b' cell with 'a'.
7. If there is a cell of value 'a' or 'c' surrounded by four cells of the opposite value, replace the center cell with the opposite value.
8. If there is a cell of value 'a' or 'c' surrounded by five cells of the opposite value, replace the center cell with the opposite value, and also replace the surrounding cells with the opposite value.
9. If there is a cell of value 'a' or 'c' surrounded by six cells of the opposite value, replace the center cell with the opposite value, and also replace the surrounding cells with the opposite value, but only if the center cell is not already surrounded by three cells of the opposite value.

Based on these observations, we can create a set of rules to apply to the input grid to generate the output grid. Here are the rules in a more formalized format:

1. Replace any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three identical cells (either 'a', 'b', or 'c') with the next value in the sequence ('a' -> 'b' -> 'c').
2. Replace any pair of adjacent cells of the same value (either 'a' or 'c') with the opposite value, unless they are part of a larger sequence of three or more identical cells.
3. Replace any cell of value 'a' surrounded by three cells of value 'c' with 'b'.
4. Replace any cell of value 'c' surrounded by three cells of value 'a' with 'b'.
5. Replace any cell of value 'b' surrounded by three cells of value 'a' with 'c'.
6. Replace any cell of value 'b' surrounded by three cells of value 'c' with 'a'.
7. Replace any cell of value 'a' or 'c' surrounded by four cells of the opposite value with the opposite value.
8. Replace any cell of value 'a' or 'c' surrounded by five cells of the opposite value with the opposite value, and also replace the surrounding cells with the opposite value.
9. Replace any cell of value 'a' or 'c' surrounded by six cells of the opposite value with the opposite value, and also replace the surrounding cells with the opposite value, but only if the center cell is not already surrounded by three cells of the opposite value.

Now, let's apply these rules to the test input grid:
```
c, a, b, a, c, a, c, c, i, c, a, a, a, a
c, c, c, a, a, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, c

a, c, b, a, a, a, a, a, i, c, c, a, c, c
