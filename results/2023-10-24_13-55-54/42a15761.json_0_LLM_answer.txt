LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Based on the patterns observed in the training data, it appears that each row of the input grid is being transformed into a new row by shifting the elements one position to the right, wrapping around to the beginning of the row when necessary. Additionally, some elements are being changed to their complement (i.e., 'a' becomes 'c' and vice versa).

Therefore, to obtain the test output, we can apply the same transformation to each row of the test input. Here's the resulting test output:

c, c, c, a, c, c, c, a, c, c, c, a, c, c, c, a, c, c, c
c, c, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c
