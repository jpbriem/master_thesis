LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, if there are two or more 'a's, then the middle letter (if there is one) is replaced by 'c'. Otherwise, the middle letter remains unchanged.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input:
a, b, a
a, a, a
a, b, a

We can see that the first row has two 'a's, so the middle letter 'b' should be replaced by 'c', resulting in:
c, b, a

The second row has only one 'a', so the middle letter 'a' remains unchanged, resulting in:
a, a, a

The third row also has only one 'a', so the middle letter 'b' remains unchanged, resulting in:
a, b, a

Therefore, the test output would be:
c, b, a
a, a, a
a, b, a

Solution:
c, c, a
a, a, a
a, a, a
