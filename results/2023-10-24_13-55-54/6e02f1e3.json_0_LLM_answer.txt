LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
c, c, c
d, c, d
d, d, d

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row of the input, if there are two or more identical letters, then the corresponding letter appears twice in the output row. If there are three identical letters, then the middle letter is skipped in the output.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

test input: e, e, e
c, d, c
d, c, d

Applying the pattern, we get:

test output: e, e, e
a, f, a
a, a, f

Therefore, the test output is: e, e, e
a, f, a
a, a, f
################################################################

Solution:
a, a, f
a, f, a
f, a, a
