LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, i
a, a
a, i
train output:
i, a, a, i
a, a, a, a
i, a, a, i
i, a, a, i
a, a, a, a
i, a, a, i
i, a, a, i
a, a, a, a
i, a, a, i
End of example.
train input:
c, a
c, c
c, a
train output:
a, c, c, a
c, c, c, c
a, c, c, a
a, c, c, a
c, c, c, c
a, c, c, a
a, c, c, a
c, c, c, c
a, c, c, a
End of example.
train input:
a, a
a, f
f, a
train output:
a, f, f, a
f, a, a, f
a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a
f, a, a, f
a, f, f, a
a, f, f, a
f, a, a, f
a, a, a, a
End of example.
test input:
d, d
d, a
d, d
test output:[/INST]
################################################################

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, the letter in the first column is repeated three times, followed by the letter in the second column, which is also repeated three times. This is true for all three rows in every training example.

Therefore, the test output for the test input "d, d" would be:

d, d, d, a, a, a
################################################################

Solution:
d, d, d, d
a, d, d, a
d, d, d, d
d, d, d, d
a, d, d, a
d, d, d, d
d, d, d, d
a, d, d, a
d, d, d, d
