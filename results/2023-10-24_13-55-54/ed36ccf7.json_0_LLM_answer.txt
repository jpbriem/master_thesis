LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
j, a, a
j, j, j
j, j, j
train output:
a, j, j
a, j, j
j, j, j
End of example.
train input:
g, g, g
a, a, a
g, g, a
train output:
g, a, a
g, a, g
g, a, g
End of example.
train input:
a, a, j
a, a, j
j, j, j
train output:
j, j, j
a, a, j
a, a, j
End of example.
train input:
c, a, c
a, a, c
a, c, c
train output:
c, c, c
a, a, c
c, a, a
End of example.
test input:
a, a, a
f, a, a
a, f, f

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that the output letter is determined by the majority vote of the three input letters for each row. If two or more of the input letters are the same, then the output letter is the same as well. Otherwise, if one letter appears twice in the row, it will be the output letter. If none of these conditions are met (i.e., there is no clear majority), then the output letter is the third letter in the row.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to get the test output:

test input: a, a, a
The majority vote for this row is "a", so the output letter would be "a".

test input: f, a, a
The majority vote for this row is "a", so the output letter would be "a".

test input: a, f, f
The majority vote for this row is "f", so the output letter would be "f".

Therefore, the test output would be:
a, a, a
a, a, a
f, f, f

Solution:
a, a, f
a, a, f
a, f, a
