LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that each row of the input corresponds to a letter in the output. Specifically:

* The first row of the input corresponds to the first letter of the output.
* The second row of the input corresponds to the second letter of the output.
* The third row of the input corresponds to the third letter of the output.

Using this pattern, we can predict the test output as follows:

test input: e, e, e
d, c, d
i, i, i

Applying the pattern, we get:

test output: f, f, f
a, a, a
a, a, a

Therefore, the predicted test output is f, f, f a, a, a.

Solution:
f, f, f
a, a, a
f, f, f
