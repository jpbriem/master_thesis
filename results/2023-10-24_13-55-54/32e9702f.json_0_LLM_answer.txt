LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be that each row of letters is either all the same letter (such as "e" or "a") or a sequence of letters that alternates between two letters (such as "a" and "d"). In addition, there are certain positions in the grid where the letter changes, such as the center position in the first two train inputs.

Based on this observation, we can try to apply the pattern to the test input to predict the test output. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. Start by filling in the top and bottom rows of the grid with the same letter (for example, "a").
2. For each row, starting from the second row, compare the letter in the current position to the letter in the previous position. If they are the same, keep the current letter the same. If they are different, change the current letter to the other letter.
3. Repeat step 2 for each row until the end of the grid is reached.
4. The resulting grid of letters should be the test output.

Here's an example of how this process would work for the test input:

1. Fill in the top and bottom rows with "a".
2. Starting from the second row, compare the letters in each position to the previous position:
* Second row: "g" (different from "a"), so change "a" to "g".
* Third row: "g" (different from "g"), so change "g" to "a".
* Fourth row: "g" (different from "a"), so change "a" to "g".
* Fifth row: "g" (different from "g"), so change "g" to "a".
* Sixth row: "a" (different from "g"), so change "g" to "a".
* Seventh row: "a" (different from "a"), so change "a" to "g".
* Eighth row: "a" (different from "g"), so change "g" to "a".
3. Repeat step 2 for each row until the end of the grid is reached.
4. The resulting grid of letters should be the test output:

g, g, g, a, a, a, g, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, g, g, g, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, g, g, g, g, g
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Therefore, the predicted test output is:

g, g, g, a, a, a, g, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, g, g, g, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, g, g, g, g, g
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Note that this is just one possible way to apply the pattern to the test input. There may be other ways to interpret the pattern and arrive at a different solution.
