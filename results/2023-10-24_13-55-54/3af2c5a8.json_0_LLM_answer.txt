LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, a, i, a
a, i, a, i
a, a, i, a
train output:
a, a, i, a, a, i, a, a
a, i, a, i, i, a, i, a
a, a, i, a, a, i, a, a
a, a, i, a, a, i, a, a
a, i, a, i, i, a, i, a
a, a, i, a, a, i, a, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, the letter in the first column is repeated until a different letter is encountered. The exception to this rule is when there is a letter 'd' in the second column, which causes the rest of the row to be filled with 'd's.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

e, a, a, a, e, a, a, a
a, a, a, e, a, a, a, e
e, e, a, a, e, e, a, a

Here's how the pattern applies to the test input:

1. First row: 'e' in the first column, so repeat 'e' until a different letter is encountered (which doesn't happen in this row).
2. Second row: 'a' in the first column, so repeat 'a' until a different letter is encountered ('e' in the third column).
3. Third row: 'e' in the first column, so repeat 'e' until a different letter is encountered ('a' in the fourth column).
4. Fourth row: 'a' in the first column, so repeat 'a' until a different letter is encountered ('e' in the sixth column).
5. Fifth row: 'e' in the first column, so repeat 'e' until a different letter is encountered ('a' in the seventh column).
6. Sixth row: 'a' in the first column, so repeat 'a' until a different letter is encountered ('e' in the eighth column).
7. Seventh row: 'e' in the first column, so repeat 'e' until a different letter is encountered ('a' in the ninth column).
8. Eighth row: 'a' in the first column, so repeat 'a' until a different letter is encountered ('e' in the tenth column).
9. Ninth row: 'e' in the first column, so repeat 'e' until a different letter is encountered ('a' in the eleventh column).
10. Tenth row: 'a' in the first column, so repeat 'a' until a different letter is encountered ('e' in the twelfth column).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
