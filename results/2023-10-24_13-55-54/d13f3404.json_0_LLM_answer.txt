LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each letter in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output grid, based on their positions.

The first train input and output pair shows a straightforward mapping, where each letter in the input grid is replaced by the same letter in the output grid, but shifted one position to the right.

The second train input and output pair introduces a new element, 'i', which is mapped to the letter 'e' in the output grid. Additionally, there is a shift of two positions to the right in the output grid.

The third train input and output pair introduces another new element, 'g', which is mapped to the letter 'a' in the output grid. There is also a shift of three positions to the right in the output grid.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce the following general rule for transforming an input grid into an output grid:

1. For each row of the input grid, shift the letters one position to the right.
2. If the letter in the input grid is 'a', replace it with 'a' in the output grid.
3. If the letter in the input grid is 'b', replace it with 'g' in the output grid.
4. If the letter in the input grid is 'c', replace it with 'i' in the output grid.
5. If the letter in the input grid is 'd', replace it with 'e' in the output grid.
6. If the letter in the input grid is 'e', replace it with 'a' in the output grid.
7. If the letter in the input grid is 'j', replace it with 'a' in the output grid.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

test input: a, a, d

Shifting the letters one position to the right gives us:

a, a, d, a

Replacing 'a' with 'a' and 'd' with 'e' gives us:

a, a, e, a

Therefore, the test output would be:

a, a, e, a

Solution:
a, a, d, a, a, a
a, a, a, d, a, a
a, e, j, a, d, a
a, a, e, j, a, d
a, a, a, e, j, a
a, a, a, a, e, j
