LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, if there are any 'i's in the row, they are replaced by the letter that appears immediately to their right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary). Otherwise, the row remains unchanged.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test output:
a, a, a, a, a
a, i, i, a, a
a, a, i, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
################################################################

Solution:
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, c, a, a
a, c, c, a, a
a, a, c, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
