LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
i, g
g, e
train output:
i, g, i, g, i, g
g, e, g, e, g, e
g, i, g, i, g, i
e, g, e, g, e, g
i, g, i, g, i, g
g, e, g, e, g, e
End of example.
train input:
h, j
e, d
train output:
h, j, h, j, h, j
e, d, e, d, e, d
j, h, j, h, j, h
d, e, d, e, d, e
h, j, h, j, h, j
e, d, e, d, e, d
End of example.
test input:
d, c
h, i

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, the letters in the input are repeated a certain number of times, then the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary) is added to the end of the row.

For example, in the first training input, "i" appears twice, followed by "g", which appears three times, followed by "i" again. In the second training input, "h" appears twice, followed by "j", which appears three times, followed by "h" again.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

Test input: d, c

* D appears once, followed by C, which appears twice. Therefore, the first row of the test output would be "d, c, c".

Test input: h, i

* H appears twice, followed by I, which appears once. Therefore, the second row of the test output would be "h, i, h".

Therefore, the complete test output would be:

d, c, c
h, i, h

Solution:
d, c, d, c, d, c
h, i, h, i, h, i
c, d, c, d, c, d
i, h, i, h, i, h
d, c, d, c, d, c
h, i, h, i, h, i
