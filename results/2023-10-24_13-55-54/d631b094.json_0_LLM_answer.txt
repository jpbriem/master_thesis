LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
a, a, a
b, a, a
a, b, a
train output:
b, b
End of example.
train input:
a, c, a
c, a, a
a, c, a
train output:
c, c, c
End of example.
train input:
a, h, a
a, a, a
a, a, a
train output:
h
End of example.
train input:
a, i, a
i, i, a
i, a, a
train output:
i, i, i, i
End of example.
test input:
e, e, a
e, a, e
a, a, e
test output:[/INST]

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that the output is the letter that appears most frequently in the input row.

Therefore, the solution for the test input would be:

test input: e, e, a
e, a, e
a, a, e

The most frequent letter in the input row is "e", so the test output would be:

test output: e, e, e
################################################################

Solution:
e, e, e, e, e
