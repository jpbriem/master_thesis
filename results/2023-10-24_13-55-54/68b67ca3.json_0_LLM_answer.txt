LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, based on the position of the letter in the input.

The first letter in the input (representing the top-left corner of the grid) is always replaced by the same letter in the output (top-left corner). The second letter in the input (representing the next row down) is replaced by the corresponding letter in the output, and so on.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can apply the same substitution to each letter in the test input, using the corresponding letter in the train output. Here's how it would look step-by-step:

1. Substitute the first letter 'd' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'c' from the train output.
2. Substitute the second letter 'a' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'a' from the train output.
3. Substitute the third letter 'd' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'a' from the train output.
4. Substitute the fourth letter 'e' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'b' from the train output.
5. Substitute the fifth letter 'a' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'a' from the train output.
6. Substitute the sixth letter 'h' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'g' from the train output.
7. Substitute the seventh letter 'a' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'a' from the train output.
8. Substitute the eighth letter 'b' in the test input with the corresponding letter 'a' from the train output.

The resulting test output would be:

c, a, a, b, g, a, a, a

Therefore, the answer for the test input is:

c, a, a, b, g, a, a, a
