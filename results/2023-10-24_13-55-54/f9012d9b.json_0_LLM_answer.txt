LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
c, b, c, b, c
b, b, b, b, b
c, b, c, b, c
a, a, b, b, b
a, a, c, b, c
train output:
b, b
c, b
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, based on the position of the letter in the input.

The first letter in the input (in this case, "c") is replaced by the second letter in the output ("b"). The second letter in the input (in this case, "b") is replaced by the third letter in the output ("c"). The third letter in the input (in this case, "c") is replaced by the fourth letter in the output ("b"), and so on.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can apply the same substitution pattern to each letter in the test input. Here's how it would work:

1. The first letter in the test input is "i". According to the pattern, the first letter in the output should be the second letter after "i" in the alphabet, which is "k". So, the first letter in the test output would be "k".
2. The second letter in the test input is "b". According to the pattern, the second letter in the output should be the third letter after "b" in the alphabet, which is "d". So, the second letter in the test output would be "d".
3. The third letter in the test input is "i". According to the pattern, the third letter in the output should be the fourth letter after "i" in the alphabet, which is "l". So, the third letter in the test output would be "l".
4. The fourth letter in the test input is "a". According to the pattern, the fourth letter in the output should be the fifth letter after "a" in the alphabet, which is "e". So, the fourth letter in the test output would be "e".
5. The fifth letter in the test input is "a". According to the pattern, the fifth letter in the output should be the sixth letter after "a" in the alphabet, which is "f". So, the fifth letter in the test output would be "f".
6. The sixth letter in the test input is "a". According to the pattern, the sixth letter in the output should be the seventh letter after "a" in the alphabet, which is "g". So, the sixth letter in the test output would be "g".
7. The seventh letter in the test input is "i". According to the pattern, the seventh letter in the output should be the eighth letter after "i" in the alphabet, which is "j". So, the seventh letter in the test output would be "j".
8. The eighth letter in the test input is "b". According to the pattern, the eighth letter in the output should be the ninth letter after "b" in the alphabet, which is "n". So, the eighth letter in the test output would be "n".
9. The ninth letter in the test input is "i". According to the pattern, the ninth letter in the output should be the tenth letter after "i" in the alphabet, which is "o". So, the ninth letter in the test output would be "o".

Therefore, the test output would be: k, d, l, e, f, g, j, n, o.
