LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a sequence of simple transformations that can be applied to each row of the input separately. Each transformation consists of a single operation (such as substitution or reversal) applied to a contiguous block of letters in the row.

The specific transformations used in the train examples are:

1. Substitution: replacing a letter with another letter, such as f -> d or a -> f.
2. Reversal: reversing the order of a contiguous block of letters, such as f, a, a -> a, a, f.
3. Insertion: inserting a new letter into a contiguous block of letters, such as f, a, a -> f, a, a, a.
4. Deletion: removing a letter from a contiguous block of letters, such as f, a, a -> f, a.

To solve the test input, we need to apply these transformations in the correct order to each row of the input. The order of operations matters, since some operations may undo or modify the effects of previous operations.

Here's one possible solution for the test input:

Row 1:
f, a, a, a, a, a

* Apply substitution: f -> d
* Result: d, a, a, a, a, a

Row 2:
a, f, a, a, a, a

* Apply reversal: a, f, a, a, a, a -> a, a, a, f, a, a
* Result: a, a, a, f, a, a

Row 3:
d, d, f, a, a, a

* Apply insertion: d, d, f, a, a, a -> d, d, f, a, a, a
* Result: d, d, f, a, a, a, a

Row 4:
a, a, a, f, a, a

* Apply deletion: a, a, a, f, a, a -> a, a, a, f
* Result: a, a, a, f

Row 5:
c, a, i, i, f, a

* Apply substitution: c -> g
* Result: g, a, i, i, f, a

Row 6:
c, a, g, a, b, f

* Apply reversal: g, a, g, a, b, f -> a, b, f, g, a, g
* Result: a, b, f, g, a, g

Therefore, the test output would be:

d, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, f, a, a
d, d, f, a, a, a
a, a, a, f
g, a, i, i, f, a
a, b, f, g, a, g
