Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The neural net doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It can be used for classification (e.g., recognizing digits), but that's a different problem from learning to generate new data.

Answer: You are correct in your assumption that the training set should contain examples of all possible inputs and outputs. However, this does not necessarily imply that the training set needs to be large. In fact, if you have a small number of neurons in each layer, then the size of the training set will also be relatively small. For instance, if you only have two layers with three neurons each, then there would only be nine possible combinations of inputs and outputs. Therefore, as long as your training set contains at least one example for each combination, then it will suffice.
