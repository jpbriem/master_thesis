Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two bits are the same". Do you mean that they have the same value? Or do you mean that they appear in the same position (i.e., the first bit is always the leftmost one)?

Answer: You can use a regular expression to match the pattern and then replace it with your desired string.

For example, if you want to replace all occurrences of `0` or `1` at the beginning of each line with `a`, you could use this regex: `/^[01]/g`. This will match any character at the start of each line that is either `0` or `1`. Then, you would just need to replace those matches with `a`.
