Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the x and y coordinates". The first number is the x coordinate, and the second number is the y coordinate? Or do you mean that the first number is the x coordinate, and the second *and* third numbers together form a single value which is the y coordinate?

Answer: \section{[Jelly](https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jelly), 1 byte}

\begin{code}
Ṁ
\end{code}

This is a monadic link taking an array of arrays as its argument (i.e., each row of the input is passed to Jelly separately). It returns another array of arrays with the same shape as the input.

The code `Ṁ` is equivalent to `ḶẈ`, which means "for each element in the input, take the maximum of itself and all elements to its right." This works because the input is guaranteed to be sorted from left-to-right within each row, so the largest element will always be at the end of each row.
