Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just learns how to map inputs to outputs. It can be used for classification (i.e., mapping an image to a label), but that's not really relevant here.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to understand why the training data has to have the same number of rows as the test data?
\end{blockquote}

It does not need to have the same number of rows. You could use any number of rows in your training set and then evaluate on a different number of rows. However, if you want to compare the performance of two models with each other, they should both be evaluated on the same dataset. If one model was evaluated on a larger dataset than another, it would be unfair to say that the first model performed better because it might simply be due to having more examples to learn from.

\begin{blockquote}

Why do we need to specify the size of the training data when creating the neural network object?
\end{blockquote}

The `size` parameter specifies the number of neurons in the hidden layer(s). This is not related to the number of rows in the training or testing sets.
