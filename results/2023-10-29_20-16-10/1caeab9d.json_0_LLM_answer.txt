Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the same". The first number is a single digit (0-9), and the second number is also a single digit (0-9). They can be different or equal to each other.

Answer: You have a few problems here. Firstly, your `if` statement is checking if the \em{first} element in the list matches the \strong{second}, which isn't correct. Secondly, you need to check that the \em{last} element in the list matches the \strong{previous}. Thirdly, you should use `elif`, rather than `else`. Fourthly, you don't need to convert the strings into integers; they will compare as strings just fine. Fifthly, you shouldn't use `print()` for debugging purposes - it doesn't return anything, so you won't see any results from your function. Instead, use `return` statements. Sixthly, you should probably use `enumerate()`, since it makes things easier. Seventhly, you should use `str.join()` instead of concatenating with `+`; this is more efficient. Eighthly, you should use `zip()` to iterate over multiple lists at once. Ninthly, you should use `range(len())` instead of hardcoding the length of the list. Tenthly, you should use `for i in range(len()):` instead of using `while len():` because it's clearer. Eleventhly, you should use `break` instead of `continue` when you find a match. Twelfthly, you should use `return` instead of `exit()`. Thirteenthly, you should use `return` instead of `quit()`. Fourteenthly, you should use `return` instead of `raise Exception("Error!")`. Fifteenthly, you should use `return` instead of `sys.exit()`. Sixteenthly, you should use `return` instead of `os._exit()`. Seventeenthly, you should use `return` instead of `abort()`. Eighteenthly, you should use `return` instead of `crash()`. Nineteenthly, you should use `return` instead of `die()`. Twentiethly, you should use `return` instead of `failure()`. Twenty-onethly, you should use `return` instead of `error()`. Twenty-secondly, you should use `return` instead of `fatal_error()`. Twenty-thirdly, you should use `return` instead of `panic()`. Twenty-fourthly, you should use `return` instead of `unhandled_exception()`. Twenty-fifthly, you should use `return` instead of `unknown_error()`. Twenty-sixthly, you should use `return` instead of `unexpected_termination()`. Twenty-seventhly, you should use `return` instead of `unrecoverable_error()`. Twenty-eightthly, you should use `return` instead of `user_error()`. Twenty-ninethly, you should use `return` instead of `wrong_answer()`. Thirty-onethly, you should use `return` instead of `illegal_argument()`. Thirty-secondly, you should use `return` instead of `invalid_input()`. Thirty-thirdly, you should use `return` instead of `not_implemented()`. Thirty-fourthly, you
