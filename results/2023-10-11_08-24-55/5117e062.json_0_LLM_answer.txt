LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a row of zeros with a copy of a neighboring row, possibly shifted by one position. Specifically, the transformations are applied in the following order:

1. Copy the second row and paste it after the first row.
2. Copy the fourth row and paste it after the third row.
3. Copy the sixth row and paste it after the fifth row.
4. Copy the eighth row and paste it after the seventh row.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until no more rows can be copied.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

test output:
2, 2, 2
0, 2, 0
2, 2, 0
