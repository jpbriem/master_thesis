LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a certain operation (such as rotation, reflection, or permutation) to the shifted grid.

The specific transformations used in each example are:

* Example 1: Shift left by 2 positions, rotate 90 degrees clockwise, and permute the top and bottom rows.
* Example 2: Shift right by 2 positions, rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, and permute the top and bottom rows.
* Example 3: Shift up by 2 positions, rotate 90 degrees clockwise, and permute the left and right columns.
* Example 4: Shift down by 2 positions, rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, and permute the left and right columns.
* Example 5: Shift left by 1 position, rotate 90 degrees clockwise, and permute the top and bottom rows.
* Example 6: Shift right by 1 position, rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, and permute the top and bottom rows.
* Example 7: Shift up by 1 position, rotate 90 degrees clockwise, and permute the left and right columns.
* Example 8: Shift down by 1 position, rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, and permute the left and right columns.

Applying these transformations to the test input grid should result in the following test output:

test output:
3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3
3, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0, 5
0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 2, 9
8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7
0, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3
0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0
