LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions, and then the elements in each row are modified based on their position.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the pattern:

1. Shift each row by a certain number of positions:
	* The first row remains unchanged.
	* The second row is shifted one position to the right.
	* The third row is shifted two positions to the right.
	* The fourth row is shifted three positions to the right.
	* The fifth row is shifted four positions to the right.
	* The sixth row is shifted five positions to the right.
	* The seventh row is shifted six positions to the right.
	* The eighth row remains unchanged.
2. Modify the elements in each row based on their position:
	* If an element is in the first column (i.e., its index is 0), it remains unchanged.
	* If an element is in the second column (i.e., its index is 1), it becomes 4 if it was previously 0.
	* If an element is in the third column (i.e., its index is 2), it becomes 7 if it was previously 0.
	* If an element is in the fourth column (i.e., its index is 3), it becomes 4 if it was previously 0.
	* If an element is in the fifth column (i.e., its index is 4), it becomes 7 if it was previously 0.
	* If an element is in the sixth column (i.e., its index is 5), it becomes 4 if it was previously 0.
	* If an element is in the seventh column (i.e., its index is 6), it becomes 7 if it was previously 0.
	* If an element is in the eighth column (i.e., its index is 7), it remains unchanged.

Based on this pattern, we can create a new matrix that has the same dimensions as the test input, and fill it with the transformed values according to the above rules. Here's the resulting test output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
