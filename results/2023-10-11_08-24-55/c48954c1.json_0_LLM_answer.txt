[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output grid is created by applying a series of "moves" to the input grid, where each move consists of shifting the cells in the input grid by a certain number of positions in a specific direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by identifying the moves that need to be made to transform the test input into the test output. We can then use these moves to create the test output grid by shifting the cells in the test input grid accordingly.

Here are the moves that I have identified based on the train inputs and outputs:

* Move 1: Shift the cells in the input grid horizontally by 1 position to the right.
* Move 2: Shift the cells in the input grid vertically by 1 position down.
* Move 3: Shift the cells in the input grid diagonally by 1 position down and to the right.

Using these moves, we can now create the test output grid by applying them to the test input grid. Here's how the test output grid would look like after applying each move:

Move 1:

8, 8, 6
6, 3, 6
6, 8, 8

Move 2:

8, 8, 6
3, 6, 6
6, 8, 8

Move 3:

8, 8, 6
6, 3, 6
8, 6, 8

As you can see, the resulting grids are not the same as the test output grid. It seems that there might be more than one way to transform the input grid into the output grid, and the moves I identified may not be the correct ones. Can you please provide me with more information about the pattern you want me to identify?
