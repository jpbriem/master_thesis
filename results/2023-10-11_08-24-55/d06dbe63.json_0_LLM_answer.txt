LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, we can observe that the pattern involves filling up the 2D grid with values following a specific arrangement. The first row has eight 0s followed by a single 5. The second row has eight 0s, followed by a single 0, and then five 5s. The third row has seven 0s, followed by a single 0, and then five 5s. The fourth row has six 0s, followed by two 0s, and then five 5s. The fifth row has five 0s, followed by three 0s, and then five 5s. The sixth row has four 0s, followed by four 0s, and then five 5s. The seventh row has three 0s, followed by five 0s, and then five 5s. The eighth row has two 0s, followed by six 0s, and then five 5s. Finally, the ninth row has one 0, followed by seven 0s, and then five 5s.

Using this pattern, we can fill up the test input to get the test output:
