LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern for generating the output is as follows:

1. Take the maximum value from the leftmost three cells in the input row.
2. If the maximum value is greater than 4, set the output cell to 9. Otherwise, set the output cell to 4.
3. Set the remaining cells in the output row to 0.

Using this pattern, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

Test input:
8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0

Maximum value in leftmost three cells: 8
Output: 9

Therefore, the test output would be:
9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
