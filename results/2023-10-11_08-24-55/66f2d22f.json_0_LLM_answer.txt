LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the input values to the output values. Each row of the input grid seems to correspond to a specific value in the output grid.

Here's a possible way to generate the output for the given test input:

1. Start with an empty output grid.
2. For each row of the input grid:
a. If the first value in the row is non-zero, set the corresponding value in the output grid to 5.
b. Otherwise (i.e., if the first value is zero), set the corresponding value in the output grid to 0.
c. If the second value in the row is non-zero, set the next value (second column) in the output grid to 5.
d. Otherwise (i.e., if the second value is zero), set the next value (second column) in the output grid to 0.
e. Repeat steps c and d for the remaining values in the row.
3. Return the filled output grid.

Using this approach, we can generate the test output as follows:

| 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Note that this pattern might not be the only solution, but it seems to work for the given examples.
