LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is shifted and/or mirrored to create the output grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can follow these steps:

1. Shift the first row of the input grid one position to the right (wrapping around to the left if necessary).
2. Mirror the second row of the input grid horizontally (i.e., swap the values of adjacent cells).
3. Shift the third row of the input grid one position to the left (wrapping around to the right if necessary).
4. Mirror the fourth row of the input grid horizontally (swapping the values of adjacent cells).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the remaining rows of the input grid.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

test output:
5, 0, 5
0, 5, 0
5, 0, 5
3, 0, 3
0, 3, 0
3, 0, 3
6, 0, 6
6, 6, 0
6, 0, 6
4, 0, 4
0, 4, 0
4, 0, 4
8, 0, 8
0, 8, 0
8, 0, 8
