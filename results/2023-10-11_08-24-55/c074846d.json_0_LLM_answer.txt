LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves filling in values in a 2D grid based on the following rules:

1. If there is a value in the top-left corner (row 1, column 1), copy it to the bottom-right corner (row 4, column 6).
2. If there is a value in the middle row (row 2 or 3), copy it to the bottom-left corner (row 5, column 1) and the top-right corner (row 1, column 6).
3. If there is a value in the bottom-left corner (row 5, column 1), copy it to the top-left corner (row 1, column 1).
4. If there is a value in the top-right corner (row 1, column 6), copy it to the bottom-right corner (row 4, column 6).

Here's how these rules can be applied to the test input:

1. There is no value in the top-left corner (row 1, column 1), so nothing needs to be copied.
2. There is a value in the middle row (row 2, column 2), which should be copied to the bottom-left corner (row 5, column 1) and the top-right corner (row 1, column 6).
3. There is already a value in the bottom-left corner (row 5, column 1), so nothing needs to be copied.
4. There is a value in the top-right corner (row 1, column 6), which should be copied to the bottom-right corner (row 4, column 6).

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this solution assumes that the grid has at least 6 columns and 4 rows. If the grid has fewer columns or rows, then some of the rules may need to be adjusted accordingly.
