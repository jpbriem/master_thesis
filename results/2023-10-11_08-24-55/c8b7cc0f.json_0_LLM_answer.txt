[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output, according to the following rules:

* 0 becomes 4
* 1 becomes 1
* 2 becomes 3
* 3 becomes 0
* 4 becomes 6
* 5 is unused
* 6 becomes 0
* 7 is unused
* 8 is unused
* 9 is unused

Using this cipher, we can decrypt the test input to get the test output:

test input: 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0

Substituting each digit according to the above rules, we get:

test output: 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is: 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
