LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 3s, with an occasional 7 or 4 thrown in. It's not clear what the exact logic behind this pattern is, but it seems to be based on the positions of the digits in the input grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by converting the input into a 2D grid representation, where each row corresponds to a digit in the input string. For example:

| 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 7 | 7 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | 0 | 7 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Next, we can apply the pattern to each row of the grid, starting from the top left corner and moving rightward, then downward. Whenever we encounter a 7, we replace it with a 3. If the result of this replacement would be a duplicate value (i.e., two 3s in the same position), we change the second occurrence of the value to 0. Here's how the test input would look after applying the pattern:

| 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Finally, we convert the modified grid back into a single string, which gives us our predicted test output:

3, 3, 3, 3
0, 3, 3, 3
3, 0, 0, 0
3, 0, 3, 0
4, 4, 4, 4
0, 2, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 0
2, 0, 2, 2

Note that this prediction is purely based on the pattern observed in the training data, and does not take into account any other factors that might affect the outcome. In particular, it's possible that the test input may contain values outside the range of 0-9, or that the pattern may break down for certain input combinations.
