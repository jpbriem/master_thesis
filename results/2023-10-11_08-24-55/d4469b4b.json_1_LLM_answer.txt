LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the number of 5's in that row corresponds to the number of 5's in the corresponding position in the output row. In particular, it seems that for each row, the first occurrence of 5 is followed by a sequence of 5's equal in length to the number of 5's in that row, and then the remaining elements in the row are filled with 0's.

Therefore, to determine the output for the test input, we can simply count the number of 5's in each row of the input and use that information to construct the output row. Here's how this would work for the test input:

Row 1: 0, 3, 0, 3, 3
Number of 5's in this row: 2
Output for this row: 5, 5, 0

Row 2: 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
Number of 5's in this row: 1
Output for this row: 5, 0, 0

Row 3: 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
Number of 5's in this row: 0
Output for this row: 0, 0, 0

Row 4: 0, 0, 3, 0, 3
Number of 5's in this row: 2
Output for this row: 5, 0, 5

Row 5: 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
Number of 5's in this row: 1
Output for this row: 5, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:
5, 5, 0
5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
5, 0, 5
5, 0, 0
