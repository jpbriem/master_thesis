LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple shift operation. In each example, a certain number of elements are shifted to the right, and the remaining elements remain unchanged.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by shifting the first element (0) three positions to the right, resulting in the second element (0) moving to the first position, the third element (0) moving to the second position, and the fourth element (3) moving to the third position. This gives us the following output:

0, 0, 3

Next, we can shift the second element (0) four positions to the right, resulting in the third element (0) moving to the second position, the fourth element (3) moving to the third position, and the fifth element (0) moving to the fourth position. This gives us the following output:

0, 3, 0

Finally, we can shift the third element (0) three positions to the right, resulting in the fourth element (3) moving to the third position, the fifth element (0) moving to the fourth position, and the sixth element (0) moving to the fifth position. This gives us the following output:

3, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 3, 0
3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
