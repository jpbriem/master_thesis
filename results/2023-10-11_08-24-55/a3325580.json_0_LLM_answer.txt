LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used to generate the output is a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output grid, based on a fixed mapping.

The mapping can be represented as follows:

| Input Digit | Output Digit |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 6 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 9 |

Using this mapping, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

| Test Input | Substitution | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 | 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 |
| 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 | 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 |
| 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0 |
| 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

| Test Input | Substitution | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 | 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 |
| 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 | 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 |
| 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
