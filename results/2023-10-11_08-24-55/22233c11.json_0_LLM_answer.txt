LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the current state of those cells.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Replace a group of cells with a copy of the same size, shifted by some amount (e.g., 3 cells right).
2. Replace a group of cells with a rotated version of the same size (e.g., rotate 90 degrees clockwise).
3. Replace a group of cells with an inverted version of the same size (e.g., flip upside down).
4. Replace a group of cells with a mirrored version of the same size (e.g., mirror horizontally).
5. Replace a group of cells with a scaled version of the same size (e.g., double the size).
6. Replace a group of cells with a translated version of the same size (e.g., move 3 cells down).
7. Replace a group of cells with a randomized version of the same size (e.g., change some cells to random values).

The order of these transformations seems to be important, as the output for one transformation is used as the input for the next transformation.

Given this pattern, we can now apply these transformations to the test input to produce the test output. Here's how the transformations would be applied to the test input:

1. Shift the entire grid 3 cells to the right.
2. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Invert the grid (flip upside down).
4. Mirror the grid horizontally.
5. Double the size of the grid.
6. Move the grid 3 cells down.
7. Randomize some cells in the grid.

After applying these transformations, the resulting grid would be the test output.
