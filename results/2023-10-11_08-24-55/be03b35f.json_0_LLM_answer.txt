[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each row of the input grid is transformed into a corresponding row of the output grid by shifting the digits by one position to the right, wrapping around to the beginning of the row when necessary.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a new 2D grid with the same dimensions as the test input, and fill it with the values from the test input. Then, we can shift the digits in each row of the grid by one position to the right, wrapping around to the beginning of the row when necessary, to obtain the corresponding row of the test output.

Here's how the transformation would look for each row of the test input:

1. 1, 1, 0, 0, 1 -> 1, 0, 1, 1, 0
2. 0, 1, 0, 1, 1 -> 0, 1, 1, 0, 1
3. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4. 1, 0, 0, 2, 2 -> 1, 0, 2, 2, 0
5. 1, 1, 0, 2, 2 -> 1, 1, 2, 2, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

1, 0
1, 1
0, 1
1, 0
1, 1
