LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be based on the positions of the digits in the input grid. The output for each row is determined by the number of digits in that row, counting from left to right.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

1. If there are 4 digits in a row (regardless of their value), the output for that row is 5.
2. If there are 3 digits in a row (regardless of their value), the output for that row is 6.
3. If there are 2 digits in a row (regardless of their value), the output for that row is 9.
4. If there is only one digit in a row (regardless of its value), the output for that row is 0.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

test output:
5, 5, 5, 5
6, 6, 6, 6
9, 9, 9, 9
0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:
5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0
