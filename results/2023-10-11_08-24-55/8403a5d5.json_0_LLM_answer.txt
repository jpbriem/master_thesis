LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a row of zeros with a row of ones, starting from the top row and moving downwards. The number of rows that are replaced in each transformation is determined by the value in the last column of the current row, which increases by 1 for each transformation.

Here's a summary of the patterns observed in the training data:

* Train input 1: No transformation is applied.
* Train input 2: One row of zeros is replaced with a row of ones, starting from the top row.
* Train input 3: Two rows of zeros are replaced with two rows of ones, starting from the top row.
* Train input 4: Three rows of zeros are replaced with three rows of ones, starting from the top row.

Based on this pattern, we can predict the output for the test input as follows:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1

Applying the pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

Test output:
0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 2, 5, 2

Therefore, the predicted output for the test input is:

0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 2, 5, 2, 0, 2
