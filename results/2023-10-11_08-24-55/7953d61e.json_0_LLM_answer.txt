LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  It appears that the pattern in the train input and output pairs is a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each element in the output grid is determined by the corresponding element in the input grid and possibly other adjacent elements. Specifically, it seems that each element in the output grid is equal to the number of neighboring elements (up, down, left, right) that have the same value as the element itself.

For example, in the first train input and output pair, the output element at position (1, 1) is equal to 4 because there are four neighboring elements (at positions (1, 0), (1, 2), (0, 1), and (2, 1)) that have the same value as the element itself. Similarly, the output element at position (3, 3) is equal to 6 because there are six neighboring elements (at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 4)) that have the same value as the element itself.

Based on this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input grid to create a complete grid, and then apply the same transformation to obtain the test output grid. Here's one possible way to do this:

test input:
4, 6, 4, 4
4, 6, 4, 4
7, 6, 7, 9
9, 4, 9, 7

Complete test input:
4, 6, 4, 4
4, 6, 4, 4
7, 6, 7, 9
9, 4, 9, 7
4, 6, 7, 9
4, 6, 7, 9
7, 6, 7, 9
9, 4, 9, 7

Applying the transformation:

test output:
4, 6, 4, 4
4, 6, 4, 4
7, 6, 7, 9
9, 4, 9, 7
4, 6, 7, 9
4, 6, 7, 9
7, 6, 7, 9
9, 4, 9, 7
