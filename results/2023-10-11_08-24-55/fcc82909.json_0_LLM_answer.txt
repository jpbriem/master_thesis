LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple rotation of the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise, followed by a possible reflection (flip) of the rotated grid about the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by rotating the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise:

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
| 9 | 0 | 1 |

Next, we can reflect the rotated grid about the main diagonal (if necessary):

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
| 9 | 0 | 1 |

Finally, we can translate the resulting grid back to the original position:

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
| 9 | 0 | 1 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
| 9 | 0 | 1 |

Note that this pattern does not take into account the specific values of the cells, only their positions in the grid. Therefore, the same pattern can be applied to any 2D grid of the same size, regardless of the values contained within.
