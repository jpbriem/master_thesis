LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be that for each row, the value of each cell is determined by the number of cells with the same value in the previous row.

Here's how the pattern works:

* If a cell has the same value as the cell immediately above it, then its value remains unchanged.
* If a cell has a different value than the cell immediately above it, then its value changes to match the value of the cell above it.
* If a cell is at the top of a row and has no value above it, then its value remains unchanged.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to get the test output:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0
0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0
0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
