LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 4s, with occasional appearances of other digits. In the first two examples, the output is always 4, except for the last row, which is always 0. In the third example, the output is 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, except for the last row, which is 0.

Based on this pattern, the test output would likely be:

0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the last row of each input is always 0, so the corresponding output should also be 0.
