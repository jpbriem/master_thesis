LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in the input grid to corresponding values in the output grid, based on their positions in the grid. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input grid is mapped to a corresponding value in the output grid, according to the following rules:

1. If the value in the input grid is 0, then the corresponding value in the output grid is also 0.
2. If the value in the input grid is 8, then the corresponding value in the output grid is 5.
3. If the value in the input grid is not 0 or 8, then the corresponding value in the output grid is 2.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

test output:
0, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2
2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0
2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5
5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0
5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2
2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0
5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

0, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2
2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0
2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5
5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0
5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2
2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0
5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0
