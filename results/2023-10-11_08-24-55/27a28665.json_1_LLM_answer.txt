LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that the output is equal to the number of unique values in the input row, minus the number of times the value 5 appears in the input row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can first count the number of unique values in the input row:

Unique values in test input: 7, 7, 0
Number of unique values: 3

Next, we count the number of times the value 5 appears in the input row:

Number of 5s in test input: 0

Now, we can apply the pattern to get the test output:

Test output = Number of unique values - Number of 5s
= 3 - 0
= 3

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is 3.
