LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the first occurrence of a value greater than 0 (in this case, 9) is replaced by 0, and all subsequent occurrences of that value are replaced by 8. Additionally, any values less than 0 (in this case, 0) are replaced by 0.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0
9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9
0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9

The resulting test output is:

0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0
