LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. Each row of the input grid is transformed into the corresponding row of the output grid by applying the following operations:

1. If the first element of the row is equal to 1, then set the first element of the output row to 3. Otherwise, set it to 0.
2. Set the second element of the output row to the value of the second element of the input row.
3. Set the third element of the output row to the value of the third element of the input row.
4. Set the fourth element of the output row to the value of the fourth element of the input row.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input can be calculated by applying the above operations:

test input:
1, 0, 1, 1
0, 1, 1, 1
0, 0, 1, 0
1, 0, 1, 1
4, 4, 4, 4
2, 2, 0, 2
0, 0, 2, 0
2, 0, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2

test output:
3, 0, 3, 3
0, 3, 3, 0
0, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 0, 3
4, 4, 4, 4
2, 2, 0, 2
0, 0, 2, 0
2, 0, 0, 2
0, 2, 0, 2
