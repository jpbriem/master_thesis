LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each row of the output grid is created by shifting the corresponding row of the input grid to the right by a certain number of positions. Specifically, it seems that each row of the output grid is created by taking the last n elements of the corresponding row of the input grid, where n is the number of elements in the row, and appending them to the beginning of the row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a 3x3 grid from the three rows of input values, and then apply the same shifting operation to each row to obtain the three rows of output values. Here's how the calculation would work out:

Row 1 (input): 0, 0, 3
Row 1 (output): 0, 0, 3 (no shift)

Row 2 (input): 0, 0, 0
Row 2 (output): 0, 0, 0 (no shift)

Row 3 (input): 0, 4, 9
Row 3 (output): 4, 9, 0 (shifted by 2 positions)

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 3
0, 0, 0
4, 9, 0
