LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is:

* If there are three consecutive identical digits in the input row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the corresponding output value for that position is the same as the input value.
* Otherwise, the output value for that position is zero.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test output:
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5
5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0

Note that the test input contains several instances of three consecutive identical digits, such as "5, 5, 5" and "4, 4, 4", which would result in non-zero output values according to the pattern.
