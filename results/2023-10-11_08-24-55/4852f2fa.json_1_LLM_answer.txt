LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern that can be observed is that the output is a combination of certain elements from the input row, where each element is either 0 or 8. The specific combination seems to be:

* Take the first two elements of the input row (in this case, 0 and 0).
* Skip the next two elements (in this case, 0 and 0).
* Take the next two elements (in this case, 8 and 8).
* Skip the next two elements (in this case, 0 and 0).
* Take the last two elements (in this case, 0 and 0).

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

First two elements: 0, 0
Skip next two elements: 0, 0
Next two elements: 4, 0
Skip next two elements: 0, 0
Last two elements: 0, 0

Output: 0, 0, 4, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 4, 0
