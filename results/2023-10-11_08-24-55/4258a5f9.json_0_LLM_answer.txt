LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple logic gate circuit. Each row of the input represents a binary digit (bit) that is fed into a circuit, and the corresponding row of the output represents the result of the computation performed by the circuit on those bits.

The circuit consists of three gates: AND, OR, and NOT. The AND gate takes two inputs and produces an output of 1 only if both inputs are 1. The OR gate takes two inputs and produces an output of 1 if either input is 1. The NOT gate takes a single input and produces an output that is the opposite of the input (i.e., 1 if the input is 0, and 0 if the input is 1).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a truth table that describes the behavior of the circuit for each possible combination of inputs:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Using this truth table, we can compute the output for each row of the test input:

Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0

Row 2: 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0

Row 3: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
Output: 0

Row 4: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0

Row 5: 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 1

Row 6: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0

Row 7: 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
Output: 1

Row 8: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1

Note that this solution assumes that the input and output pairs provided in the training data are correct and complete. If there are any errors or missing information, the solution may not work as expected.
