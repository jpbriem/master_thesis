LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the number of cells in the corresponding row and column of the input grid that contain the value 9 (or 8, or 7). Specifically:

* If no cells in the row or column contain the value 9 (or 8, or 7), then the output cell contains 0.
* If exactly one cell in the row or column contains the value 9 (or 8, or 7), then the output cell contains 9 (or 8, or 7).
* If two or more cells in the row or column contain the value 9 (or 8, or 7), then the output cell contains 0.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the train outputs as follows:

train input:
9, 9, 0
0, 0, 9
0, 9, 0

train output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9
0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0
9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0
9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9

train input:
8, 8, 0
0, 8, 8
0, 8, 0

train output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8

train input:
7, 0, 7
7, 7, 7
0, 7, 0

train output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7

Now we can apply this pattern to the test input to obtain the test output:

test input:
1,
