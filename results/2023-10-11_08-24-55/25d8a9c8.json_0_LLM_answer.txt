LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, and then followed by a different value. The number of times each row is repeated seems to be random, but the order of the rows is consistent.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by repeating each row of the input a random number of times, and then following it with a different value. Here's one possible way to do this:

test input:
4, 4, 4
3, 2, 3
8, 8, 8

Repeated rows:
4, 4, 4 (repeated 3 times)
3, 2, 3 (repeated 2 times)
8, 8, 8 (repeated 4 times)

New values:
5, 5, 5 (following the repeated rows)
0, 0, 0 (following the repeated rows)
5, 5, 5 (following the repeated rows)

Test output:
5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0
5, 5, 5

Therefore, the test output would be:
5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0
5, 5, 5
