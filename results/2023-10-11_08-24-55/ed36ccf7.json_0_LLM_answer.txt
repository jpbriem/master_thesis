LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
9, 0, 0
9, 9, 9
9, 9, 9
train output:
0, 9, 9
0, 9, 9
9, 9, 9
End of example.
train input:
6, 6, 6
0, 0, 0
6, 6, 0
train output:
6, 0, 0
6, 0, 6
6, 0, 6
End of example.
train input:
0, 0, 9
0, 0, 9
9, 9, 9
train output:
9, 9, 9
0, 0, 9
0, 0, 9
End of example.
train input:
2, 0, 2
0, 0, 2
0, 2, 2
train output:
2, 2, 2
0, 0, 2
2, 0, 0
End of example.
test input:
0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0
0, 5, 5
test output:[/INST]

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that the output values are always the maximum value among the input values for each row.

Therefore, the solution to the test input would be:

test output:
0, 5, 5

Can you please provide more information or clarify the question?
