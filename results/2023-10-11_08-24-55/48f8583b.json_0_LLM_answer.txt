LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves placing the largest number in the top-left corner, then placing the second-largest number in the middle row, and finally placing the third-largest number in the bottom-right corner.

Therefore, for the test input:
9, 7, 9
9, 9, 7
7, 9, 7

The test output would be:
9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible solution based on the given training data. There may be other valid ways to solve the problem.
