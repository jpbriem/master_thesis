LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves filling in the missing values in the input grid with the numbers in the output grid, starting from the top-left corner and moving right and then down.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 6, 7, 8, 9

The first row is filled in with the numbers in the order they appear in the input grid, starting from the top-left corner (0, 6). The second row is filled in similarly (7, 8), and the third row is filled in with the remaining number (9).
