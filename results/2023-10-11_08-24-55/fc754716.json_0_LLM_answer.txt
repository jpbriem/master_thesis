LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, with some elements modified, and then the resulting rows are combined into a single output.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by identifying the repeating patterns in each row. For example, the first row has three consecutive zeros, followed by three consecutive eights. We can repeat this pattern three times, with the second and fourth rows being identical to the first row, and the third row having the same pattern but shifted by one position (i.e., 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0).

The second row has two consecutive zeros, followed by a six, and then four more zeros. We can repeat this pattern twice, with the fifth and seventh rows being identical to the second row, and the sixth row having the same pattern but shifted by one position (i.e., 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0).

The third row has three consecutive zeros, followed by a six, and then three more zeros. We can repeat this pattern twice, with the eighth and tenth rows being identical to the third row, and the ninth row having the same pattern but shifted by one position (i.e., 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0).

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0

This answer assumes that the pattern in the training data is applicable to the test input, and that there are no errors or inconsistencies in the data.
