LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the highest number of consecutive zeros in each row to the corresponding output value.

For each row, we can calculate the number of consecutive zeros by scanning the row from left to right and counting the number of zeros encountered before the first non-zero digit. If the row contains only zeros, the output value is 0. Otherwise, the output value is the number of consecutive zeros minus 1 (since the last zero in the row is not part of the consecutive sequence).

Here's a summary of the pattern in tabular form:

| Input Row | Output Value |
| --- | --- |
| All zeros | 0 |
| Non-zero followed by zeros | Number of consecutive zeros - 1 |

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

| Test Input | Output Value |
| --- | --- |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0 |
| 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 3 |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 2 |
| 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 2 |
| 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 | 0 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 2, 0
