LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be that each row is either all 0s or all 6s, except for one row that has a single non-zero value (either 1, 4, or 8). The non-zero value is always in the same position (sixth) in each row.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can simply copy the pattern from the train input and output pairs to the test input. The result will be a 3x3 grid with a single non-zero value in the sixth position, surrounded by all 0s.

Test output:

0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0
