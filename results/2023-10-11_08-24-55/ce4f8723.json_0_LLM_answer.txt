[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions, then the elements in each row are permuted in a specific way.

To explain this in more detail, let's call the input matrix "A" and the output matrix "B". We can represent the transformation as follows:

B = P(A)

where "P" is a permutation matrix that depends on the specific example.

For the first example, the permutation matrix "P" is:

P = [1 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 0 0 1]

This means that we permute the elements in each row of A as follows:

* Row 1: no change (just copy the elements as they are)
* Row 2: swap the first two elements
* Row 3: swap the first three elements
* Row 4: no change (just copy the elements as they are)

Applying this permutation matrix to the input matrix A gives us the output matrix B:

B = P(A) = [3 3 3 3]
[0 3 3 3]
[3 3 0 0]
[3 0 3 3]

The second example has a similar pattern, but with a different permutation matrix:

P = [1 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 0 0 1]

This time, we have:

* Row 1: no change (just copy the elements as they are)
* Row 2: swap the first two elements
* Row 3: swap the first three elements
* Row 4: no change (just copy the elements as they are)

Applying this permutation matrix to the input matrix A gives us the output matrix B:

B = P(A) = [3 3 3 3]
[0 3 3 3]
[3 3 0 0]
[3 3 3 3]

The third example is similar, but with a different permutation matrix:

P = [1 0 0 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 0 0 1]

This time, we have:

* Row 1: no change (just copy the elements as they are)
* Row 2: swap the first two elements
* Row 3: swap the first three elements
* Row 4: no change (just copy the elements as they are)

Applying this permutation matrix to the input matrix A gives us the output matrix B:

B = P(A) = [3 3 0 3]
[3 3 3 3]
[3 3 3 0]
[3 3 3 3]

Finally, the test input is:

A = [1 0 1 0]
[1 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[1 0 1 0]
[4 4 4 4]
[2 2 0 0]
[0 0 2 0]
[0 2 0 2]
[2 2 2 0]

We can apply the same permutation matrix "P" to the test input matrix A to get the test output matrix B:

B = P(A) = [3 3 3 3]
[3 3 3 3]
[3 3 0 0]
[3 3 3 3]
[4 4 4 4]
[2 2 0 0]
[0 0 2 0]
[0 2 0 2]
[2 2 2 0]

Therefore, the test output is:

B = [3 3 3 3]
[3 3 3 3]
[3 3 0 0]
[3 3 3 3]
[4 4 4 4]
[2 2 0 0]
[0 0 2 0]
[0 2 0 2]
[2 2 2 0]
