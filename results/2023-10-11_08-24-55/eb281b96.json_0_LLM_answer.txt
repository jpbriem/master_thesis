[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 2s (or 3s in the last row of the test input), with each digit being determined by the corresponding digit in the previous row. Specifically, if the previous digit was 0, the current digit is 2 (or 3), and if the previous digit was 2 (or 3), the current digit is 0.

Therefore, starting from the first row of the test input, where all digits are 0, we can generate the next row by changing each 0 to 2, resulting in the second row of the test input. We can then repeat this process for each subsequent row, alternating between 0s and 2s (and 3s in the last row) to obtain the entire test output.

So, the test output would be:

0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3

Note that this solution assumes that the pattern continues indefinitely, and does not take into account any potential boundary conditions that may affect the output for extremely large grids.
