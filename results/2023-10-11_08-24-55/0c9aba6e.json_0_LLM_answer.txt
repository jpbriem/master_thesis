LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions to the left or right, and then the resulting grid is rotated by 90 degrees.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by shifting each row by the number of positions specified in the corresponding train output. For example, the first row of the test input (0, 0, 0, 2) should be shifted 3 positions to the left, since the first three elements of the first row of the train output are 0, 0, and 0. This gives us the shifted row (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0).

Next, we need to rotate the shifted grid by 90 degrees. To do this, we can simply transpose the matrix, so that the rows become columns and vice versa. This gives us the rotated grid:

(0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2)

Finally, we can apply the same reflection symmetry as in the train output, by flipping the rotated grid over the main diagonal. This gives us the final test output:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
(2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
