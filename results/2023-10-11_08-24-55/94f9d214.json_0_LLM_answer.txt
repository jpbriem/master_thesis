LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions to the left or right, and then the resulting grid is rotated by 90 degrees.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by shifting each row by the number of positions specified in the corresponding output row. For example, the first row of the test input is shifted 3 positions to the left (since the first output row has a value of 3), and the second row is shifted 3 positions to the right (since the second output row has a value of 0).

After shifting each row, we rotate the resulting grid by 90 degrees clockwise. This gives us the final test output, which should match the expected output for the given test input.

Here's the detailed calculation for each row of the test input:

1. 0, 3, 0, 3 -> shifted by -3, then rotated 90 degrees = 3, 0, 0, 3
2. 3, 3, 3, 0 -> shifted by 3, then rotated 90 degrees = 0, 3, 3, 0
3. 0, 0, 0, 3 -> shifted by -3, then rotated 90 degrees = 0, 0, 3, 0
4. 3, 3, 3, 0 -> shifted by 3, then rotated 90 degrees = 0, 0, 0, 3
5. 0, 0, 1, 1 -> shifted by -1, then rotated 90 degrees = 1, 1, 0, 0
6. 0, 0, 1, 1 -> shifted by -1, then rotated 90 degrees = 1, 1, 0, 0
7. 0, 1, 0, 0 -> shifted by -1, then rotated 90 degrees = 0, 1, 0, 0
8. 1, 1, 0, 0 -> shifted by -1, then rotated 90 degrees = 0, 0, 1, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

3, 0, 0, 3
0, 3, 3, 0
0, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 3
