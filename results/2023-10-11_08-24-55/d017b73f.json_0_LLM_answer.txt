LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the number of cells in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output cell at position (i, j) is equal to the number of cells in row i of the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to j.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a 3x3 grid for the input and output, and then use the same rules to fill in the output grid based on the values in the input grid. Here's how the test input and output would look after applying the pattern:

Test Input:
0, 2, 0
2, 2, 0
0, 0, 3

Test Output:
0, 2, 1
2, 2, 0
0, 0, 3
