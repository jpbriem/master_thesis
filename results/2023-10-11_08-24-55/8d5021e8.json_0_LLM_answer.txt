[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is either a copy of the corresponding cell in the input grid, or a copy of a neighboring cell in the input grid, depending on the value of that cell. Specifically, it seems that if the value of a cell in the input grid is 0, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will have the same value (0) regardless of what its neighbors' values are. If the value of a cell in the input grid is nonzero (8 or 2), then the corresponding cell in the output grid will take on the value of one of its neighbors, specifically the nearest neighbor to the northwest (top-left) of the input grid cell.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by creating an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. We can then iterate over each cell in the input grid, applying the following rules to determine the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid:

1. If the value of the current cell in the input grid is 0, set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to 0.
2. Otherwise (i.e., if the value of the current cell in the input grid is 8 or 2), look at the four nearest neighbors of the current cell in the input grid (the cells directly to the north, south, east, and west of the current cell). Set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to the value of whichever of these four neighbors has the highest value. If there are multiple neighbors with the same highest value, choose the one that is closest to the northwest (top-left) of the input grid cell.

Here's how this would work for the test input you provided:

| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |

First, we would examine the top-left corner of the input grid, which contains the value 3. Since this value is nonzero, we would look at the four nearest neighbors of this cell in the input grid: the cells directly to the north, south, east, and west of it. These cells have values 3, 3, 0, and 3, respectively. Since the highest value among these neighbors is 3, and the closest of these neighbors to the northwest (top-left) of the input grid cell is the cell with value 3 directly to the north, we would set the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid to 3.

Next, we would move clockwise around the input grid, repeating this process for each cell. The resulting output grid would be:

| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

3, 3, 3, 3
