LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each number in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding number in the output grid, based on a fixed mapping.

The mapping can be represented as follows:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 4 |
| 6 | 0 |

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can substitute each number in the input grid with the corresponding number in the output grid, using the mapping above. Here's the resulting test output:

| Test Input | Substitution | Test Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 4 | 4 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 4 | 4 |

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 4
