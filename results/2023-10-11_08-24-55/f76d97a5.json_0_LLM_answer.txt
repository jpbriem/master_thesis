[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary. Specifically, it seems that each row is shifted by the number of positions equal to the second value in the row, modulo the length of the row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can first convert the input into a 2D grid representation, where each row is represented by a list of values. We can then apply the shifting transformation to each row, using the second value in the row as the shift amount, modulo the length of the row. Finally, we can convert the resulting 2D grid back into a single row representation, which will give us the test output.

Here's how this would work for the test input you provided:

Test input:
3, 3, 3, 5, 3
3, 5, 3, 3, 3
3, 5, 5, 3, 5
3, 3, 3, 5, 3
5, 5, 5, 3, 3

First, we convert the input into a 2D grid representation:

Grid:
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]
[3, 5, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 5, 5, 3, 5]
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]
[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]

Next, we apply the shifting transformation to each row, using the second value in the row as the shift amount, modulo the length of the row. For example, the first row has a shift amount of 3 (the second value), so we shift the row by 3 positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the row since we're at the end of the row. This gives us:

Shifted grid:
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]
[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]
[5, 5, 5, 3, 5]
[3, 3, 3, 5, 3]
[1, 5, 5, 3, 3]

Finally, we convert the shifted grid back into a single row representation, which gives us the test output:

Test output:
1, 5, 5, 3, 3
