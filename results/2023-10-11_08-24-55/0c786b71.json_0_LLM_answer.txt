[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output value at position (i, j) is equal to the number of cells in the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to i + j - 1.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a 2D grid with the same dimensions as the test input, and initialize all cells to 0. Then, for each cell in the test input, we can increment the corresponding cell in the output grid by 1 if the value of the cell in the test input is greater than or equal to the row index plus the column index minus 1. Finally, we can return the contents of the output grid as the test output.

Here's an example of how this would work for the first test input:

Test input: 8, 5, 7, 8

Output grid initialization:
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

For the first cell in the test input (8), we increment the cell at position (1, 1) in the output grid by 1, since 8 >= 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.

Output grid after first iteration:
[1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

For the second cell in the test input (5), we do not increment any cells in the output grid, since 5 < 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.

Output grid after second iteration:
[1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

For the third cell in the test input (7), we increment the cell at position (1, 2) in the output grid by 1, since 7 >= 1 + 2 - 1 = 2.

Output grid after third iteration:
[1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

For the fourth cell in the test input (8), we increment the cell at position (2, 1) in the output grid by 1, since 8 >= 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.

Output grid after fourth iteration:
[1, 0, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the test output for the first test input would be:

[1, 0, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]

We can apply this process to the remaining test inputs using the same method.
