LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple copy operation, where each element in the input grid is copied to the corresponding position in the output grid. Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible solution based on the given training data. There may be other valid solutions or patterns that can be derived from the given data.
