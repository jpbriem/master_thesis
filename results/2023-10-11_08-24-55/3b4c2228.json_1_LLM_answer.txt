LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 1s and 0s, with some occasional 2s and 3s. There doesn't seem to be any complex logic or rule governing the transformation of the input into the output.

Based on the provided examples, here's a possible approach to generate the output for a given input:

1. Initialize an empty output array of the same size as the input.
2. Iterate through each row of the input.
3. If the first element of the current row is non-zero (i.e., 1, 2, or 3), set the corresponding element of the output array to 1. Otherwise (i.e., if the first element is 0), set the corresponding element of the output array to 0.
4. For the remaining elements of the current row (i.e., starting from the second element), copy the value of the corresponding element from the previous row's output array.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all rows have been processed.
6. Return the completed output array.

Using this approach, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
3, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0

test output:
1, 0, 0
0, 1, 0
0, 0, 1
0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0
