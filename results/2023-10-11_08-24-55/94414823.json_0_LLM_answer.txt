LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a rotation to the shifted grid. The rotations are always by multiples of 90 degrees (i.e., 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees).

The first transformation is always a horizontal shift of 4 positions, followed by a rotation of 90 degrees. The second transformation is either a vertical shift of 2 positions or a diagonal shift of 2 positions in a clockwise direction, followed by a rotation of 180 degrees. The third transformation is either a horizontal shift of 4 positions or a diagonal shift of 2 positions in a counterclockwise direction, followed by a rotation of 270 degrees. The fourth transformation is always a horizontal shift of 4 positions, followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following sequence of transformations:

1. Horizontal shift of 4 positions + Rotation of 90 degrees
2. Diagonal shift of 2 positions in a clockwise direction + Rotation of 180 degrees
3. Horizontal shift of 4 positions + Rotation of 270 degrees
4. Diagonal shift of 2 positions in a counterclockwise direction + Rotation of 90 degrees

After applying these transformations to the test input, we get the following output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
