LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

test output:[/INST]
################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shift.

The modifications appear to be as follows:

* When the grid is shifted horizontally or vertically by 1 position, the values in the grid are unchanged.
* When the grid is shifted horizontally or vertically by 2 positions, the values in the grid are swapped.
* When the grid is shifted diagonally by 1 position, the values in the grid are rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.
* When the grid is shifted diagonally by 2 positions, the values in the grid are rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

1. Shift the input grid by (3, 0) to obtain the first row of the output grid.
2. Shift the input grid by (0, 3) to obtain the second row of the output grid.
3. Shift the input grid by (-1, -1) to obtain the third row of the output grid.
4. Shift the input grid by (-1, 0) to obtain the fourth row of the output grid.
5. Shift the input grid by (0, -1) to obtain the fifth row of the output grid.
6. Shift the input grid by (1, -1) to obtain the sixth row of the output grid.
7. Shift the input grid by (1, 0) to obtain the seventh row of the output grid.
8. Shift the input grid by (0, 1) to obtain the eighth row of the output grid.
9. Shift the input grid by (-1, 1) to obtain the ninth row of the output grid.

Therefore, the test output would be:

5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
