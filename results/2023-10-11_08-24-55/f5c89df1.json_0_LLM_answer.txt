LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is being transformed into a single number, with the following rules:

1. If there are no 8s in the row, the output is 0.
2. If there is exactly one 8 in the row, the output is 8.
3. If there are two or more 8s in the row, the output is the number of 8s minus 1.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the last row of the test input to get:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Which would give us an output of:

0
