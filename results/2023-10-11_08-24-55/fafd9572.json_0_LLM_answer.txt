LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 2 positions
2. Shift up (vertically) by 2 positions
3. Shift right (horizontally) by 1 position
4. Shift down (vertically) by 1 position
5. Apply logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid

The resulting grid is then used as the input for the next iteration of the pattern. This process is repeated for a total of 5 iterations.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input grid:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 2 positions:

| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

2. Shift up (vertically) by 2 positions:

| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

3. Shift right (horizontally) by 1 position:

| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

4. Shift down (vertically) by 1 position:

| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

5. Apply logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:

| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 7 | 4 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

Note that the above explanation is based on the provided training data, and it may not necessarily generalize well to other input grids.
