[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in the input grid to corresponding values in the output grid, based on their positions in the grid. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input grid is mapped to a corresponding value in the output grid, based on the following rules:

1. If the value in the input grid is equal to 0, then the corresponding value in the output grid is also 0.
2. If the value in the input grid is greater than 0, then the corresponding value in the output grid is equal to the number of positions that the value appears in the input grid, starting from the top-left corner and moving right and then down.

For example, in the first train input and output pair, the value 3 appears three times in the input grid, so the corresponding value in the output grid is 3. The value 8 appears twice in the input grid, so the corresponding value in the output grid is 2.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input grid to get the test output:

test input:
4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0

test output:
4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0
