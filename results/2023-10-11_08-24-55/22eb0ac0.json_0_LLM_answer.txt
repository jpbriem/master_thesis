LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves copying the input values into the output row by row, but with some modifications. Specifically, the output values are shifted by one position to the right, so that each value is placed in the next position to the right of its corresponding input value. Additionally, the last value of each row is wrapped around to the beginning of the next row.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
