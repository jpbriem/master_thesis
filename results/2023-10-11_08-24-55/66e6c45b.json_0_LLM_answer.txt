LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple rotation of the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise, followed by a possible reflection (flip) of the rotated grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by rotating the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise:

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 3, 0
0, 4, 9, 0
0, 0, 0, 0

This gives us:

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 4, 0
0, 4, 9, 0
0, 0, 0, 0

Next, we can reflect the rotated grid horizontally (flipping it over):

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 9, 0
0, 3, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0

Finally, we can rotate the reflected grid back to its original orientation (counterclockwise by 90 degrees):

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 4, 0
0, 4, 9, 0

The resulting grid is the test output:

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 4, 0
0, 4, 9, 0
