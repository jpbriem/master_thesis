LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each row of the output grid is a cyclic shift of the corresponding row of the input grid. Specifically, it seems that each element of the output grid is equal to the element in the same position in the input grid, but shifted by some number of positions to the right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply perform the same cyclic shifts on each row of the test input to obtain the test output. Here's how the shifts would work out for the three rows of the test input:

Row 1: No shift needed, since the first element of the row is already at the beginning.
Row 2: Shift by 2 positions to the right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row), so the second element becomes the first element, the third element becomes the second, and so on.
Row 3: Shift by 3 positions to the right (again wrapping around to the beginning of the row), so the third element becomes the first element, the fourth element becomes the second, and so on.

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0
5, 5, 5
