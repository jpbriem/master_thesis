[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in each row of the input to a corresponding value in the output. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input is replaced by a fixed value in the output, based on its position in the row.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. The first value in each row of the input is mapped to the first value in the corresponding row of the output.
2. The second value in each row of the input is mapped to the second value in the corresponding row of the output, and so on.
3. If a value in the input is equal to 0, its corresponding value in the output is also 0. Otherwise, the corresponding value in the output is equal to 6 (for the first two train examples) or 5 (for the third train example).

Based on this pattern, we can create a simple algorithm to generate the output for a given input. Here's an example of how to apply the pattern to the test input:

test input:
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
9, 0, 1, 1, 0, 9
9, 0, 1, 1, 0, 9
9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9

First, we apply the mapping described above to each row of the input:

1. The first value in each row is mapped to the first value in the corresponding row of the output. Since the first value in each row of the test input is 9, the first value in each row of the test output will be 9.
2. The second value in each row of the input is mapped to the second value in the corresponding row of the output. Since the second value in each row of the test input is either 0 or 1, the second value in each row of the test output will be either 0 or 6 (or 5, for the third train example).
3. If a value in the input is equal to 0, its corresponding value in the output is also 0. Since there are several 0s in the test input, these values will be mapped to 0s in the test output.

Using this algorithm, we can generate the test output as follows:

test output:
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6
0, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6
0, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9

Therefore, the test output is:

9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6
0, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6
0, 6, 1, 1, 0, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
