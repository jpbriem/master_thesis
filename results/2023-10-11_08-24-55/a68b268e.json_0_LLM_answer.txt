LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern for generating the output for a given input appears to be:

1. Take the first row of the input (7, 7, 7, 0, 1) and copy it as is.
2. For each subsequent row, shift the elements one position to the right, wrapping around to the beginning of the row when necessary.
3. Place the last element of each row at the beginning of the next row.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all rows have been processed.
5. The resulting grid is the output.

Using this pattern, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

Test Input:
7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 0

Step 1: Copy the first row as is:
7, 7, 7, 0, 1

Step 2: Shift the elements of the second row one position to the right:
7, 7, 0, 1, 4

Step 3: Place the last element of the second row at the beginning of the third row:
7, 0, 1, 4, 7

Step 4: Shift the elements of the third row one position to the right:
0, 1, 4, 7, 7

Step 5: Place the last element of the third row at the beginning of the fourth row:
1, 4, 7, 7, 0

Step 6: Shift the elements of the fourth row one position to the right:
4, 7, 7, 0, 1

Step 7: Place the last element of the fourth row at the beginning of the fifth row:
7, 7, 0, 1, 4

Step 8: Repeat the process for the remaining rows.

The resulting grid is the test output:
7, 7, 7, 4, 1
7, 4, 1, 7, 7
7, 1, 7, 7, 0
7, 7, 0, 1, 4
7, 7, 4, 4, 7
7, 4, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7, 4
7, 7, 7, 4, 1
7, 7, 7, 1, 7
7, 7, 7, 7, 7

Therefore, the test output is:
7, 7, 7, 4, 1
7, 4, 1, 7, 7
7, 1, 7, 7, 0
7, 7, 0, 1, 4
7, 7, 4, 4, 7
7, 4, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7, 4
7, 7, 7, 4, 1
7, 7, 7, 1, 7
