[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each example, the output values are derived from the corresponding input values by applying a set of basic operations, such as shifting, rotating, and reflecting.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can perform the following steps:

1. Shift the input grid one position to the right (wrapping around at the edges).
2. Rotate the resulting grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Reflect the rotated grid across the diagonal (i.e., swap the top-left and bottom-right corners, and vice versa).
4. Shift the reflected grid back to the left by one position (again wrapping around at the edges).

Here's how these operations would affect the test input:

1. Shifting the input grid one position to the right results in:
0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1. Rotating the resulting grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees gives us:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1. Reflecting the rotated grid across the diagonal produces:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1. Finally, shifting the reflected grid back to the left by one position yields the test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
