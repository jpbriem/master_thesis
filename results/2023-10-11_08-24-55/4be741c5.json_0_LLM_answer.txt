LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of numbers, where each number is repeated a certain number of times before changing to the next number in the sequence.

The sequence starts with 4, then changes to 2, then 8, then back to 4, and so on. Each number is repeated a fixed number of times (4 times in the first two examples) before switching to the next number.

Based on this pattern, we can predict the next number in the sequence for the test input provided:

3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8

The pattern suggests that the next number would be 4, since we have had three consecutive 3s followed by two 2s. Therefore, the predicted output for the test input is:

4

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
