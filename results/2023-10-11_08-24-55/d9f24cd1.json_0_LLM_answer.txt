LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a row of zeros with a row of twos, while keeping the remaining rows unchanged.

Here's a summary of the transformations applied to each input grid in the training data:

1. Train Input 1: No transformation is applied.
2. Train Input 2: A single transformation is applied, replacing the first row of zeros with a row of twos.
3. Train Input 3: Two transformations are applied: first, the second row of zeros is replaced with a row of twos; then, the third row of zeros is replaced with a row of twos.
4. Train Input 4: Three transformations are applied: first, the fourth row of zeros is replaced with a row of twos; then, the fifth row of zeros is replaced with a row of twos; finally, the sixth row of zeros is replaced with a row of twos.

Based on this pattern, we can predict the output for the test input as follows:

Test Input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0

Test Output:
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0

Therefore, the predicted output for the test input is:

0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
