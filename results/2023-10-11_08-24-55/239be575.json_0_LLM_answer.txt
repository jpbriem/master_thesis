LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each row of the input grid consists of a sequence of up to six digits, with each digit being either 0, 2, 8, or a repeat of the previous digit. The corresponding output for each row is always the last digit of the row.

Therefore, to determine the test output, we can simply apply this pattern to the test input row by row:

1. The first row of the test input is 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 8. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 8.
2. The second row of the test input is 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 0.
3. The third row of the test input is 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 8.
4. The fourth row of the test input is 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 8.
5. The fifth row of the test input is 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 8.
6. The sixth row of the test input is 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 0.
7. The seventh row of the test input is 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 0.
8. The eighth row of the test input is 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8. Following the pattern, the output for this row would be 8.

Therefore, the test output would be: 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8.
