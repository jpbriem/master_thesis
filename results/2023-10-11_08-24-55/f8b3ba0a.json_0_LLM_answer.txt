LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves counting the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, and 8s in each row, and then using those counts to determine the corresponding output value.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern for each digit:

* 1: Appears 4 times in the first row, 3 times in the second row, 2 times in the third row, and 1 time in the fourth row. Output value is 1.
* 2: Appears 3 times in the first row, 2 times in the second row, 1 time in the third row, and 2 times in the fourth row. Output value is 2.
* 3: Appears 2 times in the first row, 1 time in the second row, 2 times in the third row, and 1 time in the fourth row. Output value is 3.
* 4: Appears 1 time in the first row, 2 times in the second row, 3 times in the third row, and 2 times in the fourth row. Output value is 4.
* 5: Does not appear in the first four rows. Output value is 0.
* 6: Appears 1 time in the first row, 1 time in the second row, 2 times in the third row, and 1 time in the fourth row. Output value is 6.
* 7: Does not appear in the first four rows. Output value is 0.
* 8: Appears 2 times in the first row, 1 time in the second row, 1 time in the third row, and 2 times in the fourth row. Output value is 8.

Based on this pattern, we can create a simple algorithm to generate the output for a given input:

1. Initialize an empty array to store the output values.
2. Iterate through each row of the input.
3. For each row, count the number of occurrences of each digit (1-8).
4. Use the counted values to determine the corresponding output value for that row.
5. Add the output value to the end of the output array.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all rows.
7. Return the completed output array.

Using this algorithm, we can now generate the output for the test input:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
