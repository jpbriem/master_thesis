LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 2s, with an occasional 6 thrown in. It seems that the output for a given row is determined by the number of 2s in that row, with the following rules:

* If there are an even number of 2s in the row, the output is 0.
* If there are an odd number of 2s in the row, the output is 6.
* If there are no 2s in the row, the output is 0.

Using this pattern, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0
output: 0

test input: 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
output: 6

test input: 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0
output: 0

test input: 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0
output: 0

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
output: 0

test input: 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2
output: 6

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0
