LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is transformed independently. The transformation involves replacing each digit in the row with a different digit, based on a fixed mapping.

To determine the mapping, we can analyze the train inputs and outputs. In the first train input, the digits in the first row are replaced by the corresponding digits in the second row, shifted by one position to the right. Similarly, in the second train input, the digits in the first two rows are replaced by the corresponding digits in the third and fourth rows, respectively, shifted by one position to the right. In the third train input, the digits in the first three rows are replaced by the corresponding digits in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows, respectively, shifted by one position to the right.

Based on this observation, we can infer that the mapping is a cyclic shift of the digits in each row, with a wrapping around at the end of the row. Specifically, if we denote the digits in the ith row of the input grid as ai, b_i, c_i,..., m_i (where a_i is the leftmost digit and m_i is the rightmost digit), then the corresponding digits in the ith row of the output grid would be b_i+1, c_i+1, d_i+1,..., n_i+1 (where n_i+1 is the rightmost digit in the output grid).

Therefore, to obtain the test output from the test input, we can apply the same transformation to each row of the test input. Here's how the test output would look like:

test output:
7, 6, 2, 4, 5
0, 4, 0, 6, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 2, 0
5, 0, 0, 0, 7

Note that the mapping preserves the relative positions of the digits within each row, but changes the absolute positions of some digits. Therefore, the resulting output grid will have the same shape as the input grid, but with possibly different contents.
