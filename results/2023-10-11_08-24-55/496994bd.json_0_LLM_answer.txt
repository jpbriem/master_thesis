LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each element in the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

In other words, the test output will be the same as the test input, since the pattern involves simply copying the input elements to the output.
