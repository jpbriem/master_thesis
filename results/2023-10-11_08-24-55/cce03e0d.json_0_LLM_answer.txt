LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input values. Each row of the input is transformed into a corresponding row of the output, with the following rules:

1. If the first value in a row is non-zero, set the second value to zero.
2. Set the third value to the first value.
3. Set the fourth value to the second value.
4. Set the fifth value to the third value.
5. Set the sixth value to the fourth value.
6. Set the seventh value to the fifth value.
7. Set the eighth value to the sixth value.
8. Set the ninth value to the seventh value.

Using this pattern, we can transform each row of the test input into a corresponding row of the test output:

1. 1, 2, 2 becomes 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
2. 2, 0, 1 becomes 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
3. 1, 2, 0 becomes 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
