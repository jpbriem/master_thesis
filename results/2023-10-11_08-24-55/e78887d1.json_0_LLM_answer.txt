LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying the following operations to the input grid:

1. Shifting the grid upwards by some number of positions (indicated by the presence of zeroes at the top of the grid).
2. Rotating the grid clockwise by some number of positions (indicated by the presence of non-zero values in the first column).
3. Reflecting the grid horizontally (indicated by the presence of non-zero values in the last column).
4. Adding a constant value to each row (indicated by the presence of non-zero values in the first row).

Using these operations, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

1. Shift the input grid upwards by 2 positions, so that the top two rows become zeroes.
2. Rotate the grid clockwise by 1 position, so that the second column becomes non-zero.
3. Reflect the grid horizontally, so that the last column becomes non-zero.
4. Add 2 to each row, so that every element in the grid increases by 2.

The resulting test output would be:

2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5
2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0
2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5
2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 0
2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5
0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5
2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5
0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5
2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible solution based on the provided training data. There may be other valid ways to generate the test output using different combinations of shifts, rotations, reflections, and additions.
