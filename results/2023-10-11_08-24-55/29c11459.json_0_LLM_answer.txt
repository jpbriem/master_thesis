LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of each number in the input to a corresponding number in the output, based on their positions in the grid.

Here's a possible way to describe the pattern:

1. For each row of the input, find the maximum value in that row.
2. If the maximum value is greater than 0, then set the corresponding position in the output to the maximum value plus 1. Otherwise, set it to 0.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row of the input until the entire output has been filled.

Using this pattern, we can now fill in the missing values in the test input to get the test output:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9
