LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shifted grid relative to the original grid.

The first transformation shifts the grid by two positions to the right and then sets the value at position (0,0) to 2.
The second transformation shifts the grid by three positions down and sets the value at position (0,0) to 0.
The third transformation shifts the grid by four positions to the left and sets the value at position (0,0) to 0.
The fourth transformation shifts the grid by five positions up and sets the value at position (0,0) to 7.
The fifth transformation shifts the grid by six positions to the right and sets the value at position (0,0) to 3.
The sixth transformation shifts the grid by seven positions down and sets the value at position (0,0) to 0.
The seventh transformation shifts the grid by eight positions to the left and sets the value at position (0,0) to 9.
The eighth transformation shifts the grid by nine positions up and sets the value at position (0,0) to 1.

Applying these transformations in sequence to the test input grid produces the test output grid:

Test Input:
0, 6, 6, 0, 8
0, 6, 6, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 7
8, 8, 1, 7, 9

Test Output:
2, 6, 6, 2, 8
2, 6, 6, 2, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 7
