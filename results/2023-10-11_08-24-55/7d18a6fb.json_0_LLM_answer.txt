LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 1s, with an occasional 2 or 3 thrown in. There doesn't seem to be any correlation between the input and output values, so it's difficult to discern a specific rule or formula being applied.

That being said, here's one possible way to generate the next four outputs based on the given input:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0, 4, 0, 0

The reasoning behind this output is as follows:

* The first input value is 0, which means the output should be 0.
* The second input value is also 0, which means the output should still be 0.
* The third input value is 0 again, so the output remains 0.
* The fourth input value is still 0, so the output stays at 0.
* The fifth input value is 0 once more, which means the output should increase by 1 (mod 4) to 1.
* The sixth input value is still 0, so the output stays at 1.
* The seventh input value is 0 again, which means the output should increase by 1 (mod 4) to 2.
* The eighth input value is 0, so the output stays at 2.
* The ninth input value is 0, which means the output should increase by 1 (mod 4) to 3.
* The tenth input value is 0, so the output stays at 3.
* The eleventh input value is 0, which means the output should increase by 1 (mod 4) to 0.
* The twelfth input value is 0, so the output stays at 0.

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation of the pattern; there may be other ways to generate the output values based on the given input.
