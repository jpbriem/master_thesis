LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 8s, with occasional appearances of 2s. In each row, the digits seem to alternate between 0 and 8, with an occasional 2 in the middle.

Based on this observation, the test output for the given test input would be:

0
8
0
8
0
8
0
8
0
8

Therefore, the answer for the test input is:

0
8
0
8
0
8
0
8
