[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation is determined by the value of a certain cell in the grid.

The first transformation is a rotation of the grid by 90 degrees clockwise, which is indicated by a value of 5 in the top-left corner of the grid. This is followed by a reflection of the grid over the vertical axis (value of 5 in the middle row), and then a rotation of the grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise (value of 5 in the bottom-right corner).

After these initial transformations, the pattern seems to involve alternating between two types of transformations:

1. A "shift" transformation, where the grid is shifted left or right by one cell, depending on the value of the cell in the top-left corner (0 for left shift, 5 for right shift).
2. A "mirror" transformation, where the grid is reflected over either the horizontal or vertical axis, depending on the value of the cell in the middle row (0 for horizontal mirror, 5 for vertical mirror).

These transformations are applied repeatedly, with the order of operations being determined by the values in the grid. Specifically, the order is:

1. Rotation (if necessary)
2. Shift (if necessary)
3. Mirror (if necessary)
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more transformations can be applied.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following sequence of transformations:

1. Rotation by 90 degrees clockwise (since the top-left corner has a value of 5)
2. Reflection over the vertical axis (since the middle row has a value of 5)
3. Rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise (since the bottom-right corner has a value of 5)
4. Shift left by one cell (since the top-left corner now has a value of 0)
5. Mirror horizontally (since the middle row now has a value of 5)
6. Shift right by one cell (since the top-right corner now has a value of 5)
7. Mirror vertically (since the bottom-left corner now has a value of 5)
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until no more transformations can be applied.

The resulting test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 6
0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 6, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
