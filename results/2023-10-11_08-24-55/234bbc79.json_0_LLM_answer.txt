[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the number of cells in the corresponding row and column of the input grid that contain a value greater than zero.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. For each row of the input grid, count the number of cells that contain a value greater than zero.
2. For each column of the input grid, count the number of cells that contain a value greater than zero.
3. Place the counts for each row and column into a two-dimensional array, where the first dimension corresponds to the rows and the second dimension corresponds to the columns.
4. Apply a threshold to the counts in the array, such that any cell with a count greater than zero is set to 1, and any cell with a count of zero is set to 0.
5. Convert the resulting binary array into a decimal number, and you have the corresponding cell in the output grid.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to obtain the test output:

test input:
0, 5, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 8
2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

First, let's count the number of cells in each row and column that contain a value greater than zero:

Row 1: 3 cells with values greater than zero (5, 1, and 0)
Row 2: 2 cells with values greater than zero (2 and 1)
Row 3: 1 cell with a value greater than zero (5)
Column 1: 2 cells with values greater than zero (5 and 1)
Column 2: 2 cells with values greater than zero (2 and 1)
Column 3: 1 cell with a value greater than zero (5)

Next, we place these counts into a two-dimensional array:

[ [3, 2],
[2, 2],
[1, 1] ]

Now, we apply a threshold to the counts, setting any cell with a count greater than zero to 1, and any cell with a count of zero to 0:

[ [1, 1],
[1, 1],
[1, 0] ]

Finally, we convert the resulting binary array into decimal numbers to obtain the test output:

test output:
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0
