LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the number of cells in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output cell value is equal to the number of cells in the same row as the input cell, multiplied by the number of cells in the same column as the input cell.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a 3x3 grid for each row of the input, and then apply the above rule to determine the output cell values. Here's how the test input and output would look like:

Test Input:
7, 6, 1
6, 7, 6
6, 2, 2

Output Grid:
[7, 6, 1]
[6, 7, 6]
[6, 2, 2]

Applying the pattern, we get:

Test Output:
2, 6, 1
6, 7, 2
2, 7, 6
