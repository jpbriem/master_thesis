LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves filling in values in a 2D grid based on the input values. Here's a summary of the pattern observed in the training data:

* The first row of the output grid contains the same values as the first row of the input grid.
* Each subsequent row of the output grid contains the same values as the corresponding row of the input grid, shifted one position to the right.
* If a value in the input grid is non-zero, then the corresponding value in the output grid is set to zero.
* If a value in the input grid is zero, then the corresponding value in the output grid remains unchanged.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input grid to obtain the test output grid as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is identical to the test input.
