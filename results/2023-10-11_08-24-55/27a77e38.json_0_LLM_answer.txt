LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output value at position (i, j) is equal to the minimum value among the input values at positions (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), and (i+1, j+1).

Here's an example of how this pattern would work for the first train input:

| 2 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 5 | 5 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

The output for this input would be:

| 2 | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 5 | 5 |
| 0 | 2 | 0 |

Notice that the only difference between the input and output grids is that the bottom-left corner has been changed from 0 to 2. This is because the minimum value among the input values at positions (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), and (i+1, j+1) is 2.

Using this pattern, we can now fill in the missing values in the train outputs:

train output:
2, 2, 3
5, 5, 5
0, 2, 0

train output:
3, 6, 4, 2, 4
8, 4, 3, 3, 4
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 0, 0

train output:
1, 9, 9, 6, 1, 8, 4
4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7, 1
9, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 6
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0

Now we can apply this pattern to the test input:

test input:
9, 1, 2, 8, 4, 9, 8, 2, 1
4, 4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 6, 7, 9
2, 1, 6, 9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 6
9, 8, 6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1, 7
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The resulting test output would be:

test output:
9, 1, 2, 8, 4, 9, 8, 2, 1
4, 4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 6, 7, 9
2, 1, 6, 9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 6
9, 8, 6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1, 7
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
