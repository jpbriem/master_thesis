LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a simple transformation to the input grid to produce the output grid. Specifically, the transformation involves replacing each digit in the input grid with a certain number of adjacent digits (including diagonally adjacent digits) that have the same value as the original digit. The number of adjacent digits used for replacement varies for each digit in the input grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Starting from the top-left corner of the input grid, consider a 3x3 subgrid containing the current digit and its eight neighbors.
2. If the current digit is equal to any of its eight neighbors, replace the current digit with the value of one of those neighbors (chosen arbitrarily).
3. If the current digit is not equal to any of its eight neighbors, leave it unchanged.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each digit in the input grid, starting from the next available digit after the previous one.
5. The resulting grid is the output grid.

Based on this pattern, here's the expected output for the test input you provided:
