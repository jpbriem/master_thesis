LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each row of the input grid consists of five consecutive digits that are either all 5 or all 0, followed by a single digit that is either 5 or 0. The corresponding output for each row is a single digit that corresponds to the state of the middle cell (the cell that is not on the boundary) in the row.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can simply apply this pattern to the test input. The result will be a 3x3 grid of output digits, where each output digit corresponds to the state of the middle cell in its respective row.

Here's how the pattern applies to the test input:

1st row:
The first row of the test input is 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5. Following the pattern, we can see that the middle cell is 5, so the output for this row should be 2.

2nd row:
The second row of the test input is 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0. Following the pattern, we can see that the middle cell is 0, so the output for this row should be 3.

3rd row:
The third row of the test input is 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0. Following the pattern, we can see that the middle cell is 0, so the output for this row should be 3.

4th row:
The fourth row of the test input is 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5. Following the pattern, we can see that the middle cell is 5, so the output for this row should be 2.

Therefore, the test output is:

2, 3, 3
3, 3, 2
2, 2, 2
