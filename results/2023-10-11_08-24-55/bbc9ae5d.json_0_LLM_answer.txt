[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, with the last digit of each row being filled in with zeros. The number of times each row is repeated is determined by the number of digits in the corresponding output row.

For example, in the first training example, the input row "1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0" is repeated three times, resulting in an output row of "1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0". In the second training example, the input row "2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0" is repeated four times, resulting in an output row of "2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0".

Applying this pattern to the test input, we can see that it consists of five rows, each with a single non-zero digit (1, 1, 1, 0, 0). Therefore, we would expect the output to consist of five rows, each with five repeating digits (1, 1, 1, 1, 1), followed by five rows of zeros (0, 0, 0, 0, 0). This gives us a total of ten rows for the test output.

Therefore, the test output would be:

1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
