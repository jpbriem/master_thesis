LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be:

1. Take the first two elements of the input row (in this case, 3 and 8).
2. Append the minimum of those two elements to the end of the row (so the updated row would be 3, 8, 3).
3. If the third element of the row is less than or equal to the minimum of the first two elements, append it to the end of the row (in this case, 9, so the updated row would be 3, 8, 3, 9).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining elements of the row.

Using this pattern, we can now generate the test output for the given test input:

test input: 3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

First two elements: 3, 3
Minimum: 3
Append minimum to end of row: 3, 3, 3
Third element: 9
Less than or equal to minimum: True
Append 9 to end of row: 3, 3, 3, 9
Fourth element: 5
Less than or equal to minimum: False
Do not append anything to the row.

The resulting test output would be:
3, 3, 3, 9, 5

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
