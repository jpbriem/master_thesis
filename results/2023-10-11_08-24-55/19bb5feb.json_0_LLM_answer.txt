LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the previous state of those cells. Specifically, the pattern seems to be:

1. Start with an empty grid.
2. Replace the top row with a copy of the second row.
3. Replace the second row with a copy of the third row.
4. Replace the third row with a copy of the fourth row.
5. Replace the fourth row with a copy of the fifth row.
6. Replace the fifth row with a copy of the sixth row.
7. Replace the sixth row with a copy of the seventh row.
8. Replace the seventh row with a copy of the eighth row.
9. Replace the eighth row with a copy of the ninth row (if it exists).
10. Repeat steps 2-9 until no more rows can be replaced.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

test output:
1, 3
0, 2

Therefore, the answer to the puzzle is:

1, 3
0, 2
