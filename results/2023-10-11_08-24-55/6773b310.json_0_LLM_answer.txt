LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern for generating the output for a given input appears to be:

1. If the value at position (0,0) is 0, set the value at position (1,0) to 1.
2. If the value at position (0,0) is 6, set the value at position (1,0) to 0.
3. Set the value at position (0,1) to the value at position (0,0).
4. Set the value at position (1,1) to the value at position (1,0).
5. Set the value at position (0,2) to the value at position (0,1).
6. Set the value at position (1,2) to the value at position (1,1).
7. Set the value at position (2,0) to the value at position (0,2).
8. Set the value at position (2,1) to the value at position (1,2).
9. Set the value at position (2,2) to the value at position (2,1).

Using this pattern, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 6

1. Value at position (0,0) is 0, so set value at position (1,0) to 1.
2. Value at position (0,0) is still 0, so set value at position (1,0) to 1 again.
3. Value at position (0,1) is 0, so set value at position (0,2) to 0.
4. Value at position (1,1) is 1, so set value at position (1,2) to 1.
5. Value at position (0,2) is 0, so set value at position (2,0) to 0.
6. Value at position (1,2) is 1, so set value at position (2,1) to 1.
7. Value at position (2,0) is 0, so set value at position (2,2) to 0.

test output:
1, 0, 0
