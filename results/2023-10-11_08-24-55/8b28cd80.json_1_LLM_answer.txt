LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some modifications. Specifically:

* If there is a 4 in the input, it is changed to a 5 in the output.
* If there is a 0 in the input, it remains a 0 in the output.
* If there is a non-zero value (other than 4) in the input, it is increased by 1 in the output.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values of the test input to create a complete 3x3 grid:

test input:
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
3, 0, 0

Complete grid:
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
3, 0, 0

Applying the pattern to the complete grid, we get:

test output:
5, 0, 5
0, 0, 0
5, 0, 5
