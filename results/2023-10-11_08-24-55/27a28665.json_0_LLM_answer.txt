[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the first and last elements are equal, and the middle element is either equal to the first and last elements or is zero. In addition, the number of non-zero elements in each row is odd.

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern can be summarized as follows:

1. Take the first element of the input row.
2. Set the second element to the same value as the first element.
3. Set the third element to zero if the second element is non-zero, or set it to the same value as the first element otherwise.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for the remaining elements of the row.
5. The output for the row is the number of non-zero elements in the row.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test input: 0, 8, 0
8, 8, 8
0, 8, 0

Using the above pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

1. Take the first element of the input row: 0
2. Set the second element to the same value as the first element: 0
3. Set the third element to zero since the second element is non-zero: 0
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for the remaining elements of the row: 0, 8, 0
5. The output for the row is the number of non-zero elements in the row: 1

Therefore, the test output is 1.
