[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each row of the output grid is a cyclic shift of the corresponding row of the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the first element of each row is moved to the last position, the second element is moved to the first position, and so on.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can perform the same cyclic shifts on each row of the input grid to obtain the test output. Here's how the test output would look like based on the given test input:

test input:
9, 3, 4
9, 4, 4
9, 3, 4

test output:
4, 9, 3
4, 9, 4
4, 3, 9

So, the test output would be:
4, 9, 3
4, 9, 4
4, 3, 9
