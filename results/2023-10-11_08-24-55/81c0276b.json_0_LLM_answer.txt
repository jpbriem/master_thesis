LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of inputs corresponds to a specific output. Specifically, the first three inputs in each row seem to determine the output for that row.

Therefore, to solve the test case, we can simply apply this same pattern to the given test input. Here's how the test input can be transformed into a valid output based on the given pattern:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0

transformed output:
8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0

As you can see, the transformed output follows the same pattern as the training data, where the first three inputs in each row determine the corresponding output. Therefore, the solution to the test case is:

8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0
