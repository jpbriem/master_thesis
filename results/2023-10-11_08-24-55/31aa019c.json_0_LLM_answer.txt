LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be consistent across all the training examples.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. First, the input grid is shifted horizontally by some number of positions (specified by the first value in the input).
2. Next, the grid is shifted vertically by some number of positions (specified by the second value in the input).
3. After that, the grid is shifted diagonally by some number of positions (specified by the third value in the input).
4. Finally, the resulting shifted grid is logically ANDed with the original grid to produce the output.

Based on this pattern, we can create a simple algorithm to generate the output for a given input grid. Here's an example of how to apply this algorithm to the test input you provided:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
7, 4, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 0, 0
5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0, 7
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7

First, we apply the horizontal shift specified by the first value (0) to the input grid. This results in the following grid:

0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
7, 4, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 0, 0
5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 7, 0, 7
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7

Next, we apply the vertical shift specified by the second value (0) to the grid. This results in the following grid:

0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
