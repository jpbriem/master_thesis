LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, I observed a pattern that can be used to determine the next number in the sequence. The pattern involves looking at the previous four numbers and applying the following rules:

1. If the previous four numbers are all equal, then the next number is the same as the previous four numbers.
2. If three of the previous four numbers are equal, and the fourth number is different, then the next number is the same as the third number.
3. If two of the previous four numbers are equal, and the other two numbers are different, then the next number is the same as the second number.
4. If none of the previous four numbers are equal, then the next number is the same as the first number.

Using this pattern, I generated the test output as follows:

1. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 1, 1, so the next number is also 1.
2. The first four numbers are 1, 0, 2, 0, so the next number is 2.
3. The first four numbers are 1, 2, 2, 0, so the next number is 2.
4. The first four numbers are 1, 0, 0, 0, so the next number is 1.
5. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 1, 1, so the next number is 1.
6. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 1, 4, so the next number is 4.
7. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 4, 4, so the next number is 4.
8. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 4, 0, so the next number is 0.
9. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 1, 6, so the next number is 6.
10. The first four numbers are 1, 1, 1, 1, so the next number is 1.

Therefore, the test output is:

1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 0, 6, 1
