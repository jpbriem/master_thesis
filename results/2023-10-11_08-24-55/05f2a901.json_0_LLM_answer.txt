LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 2s, with occasional appearances of 8s.

Here's a possible way to generate the test output for the given test input:

1. Start with an initial 0.
2. For each row, alternate between 0 and 2, starting with 0.
3. Whenever there is a 2 in the current row, replace it with 8 if it is followed by a 0 in the next row.
4. If there is an 8 in the current row, replace it with 2 if it is followed by a 0 in the previous row.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the input.
6. End with a final 0.

Using this pattern, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible way to generate the test output based on the given pattern. There may be other valid ways to do so as well.
