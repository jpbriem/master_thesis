LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

9, 1, 4
9, 1, 4
2, 1, 1

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, followed by a third row that is identical to one of the first two rows. The order of the rows does not seem to matter.

Therefore, for the test input, we can expect the following output:

test output:
2, 9, 2
8, 5, 2
2, 2, 8
2, 9, 2
8, 5, 2
2, 2, 8

This is because the first two rows of the test input (2, 9, 2 and 8, 5, 2) will be repeated, followed by a third row that is identical to one of the first two rows (in this case, 2, 9, 2).
