LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and a fixed mask. The masks used in the training data are:

* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0
* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0
* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0
* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The first transformation shifts the grid by one position to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
The second transformation shifts the grid by two positions to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0.
The third transformation shifts the grid by three positions to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0.
The fourth transformation shifts the grid by four positions to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0.
The fifth transformation shifts the grid by five positions to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
The sixth transformation shifts the grid by six positions to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
The seventh transformation shifts the grid by seven positions to the right, and applies the mask 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
