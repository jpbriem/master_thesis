LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and non-0s. In each row, the first element is either 0 or a non-zero value (either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9). If the first element is 0, then all elements in that row are 0. Otherwise, the remaining elements in the row alternate between 0 and the non-zero value.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this pattern does not take into account the specific values of the non-zero elements in the input; only their presence or absence matters.
