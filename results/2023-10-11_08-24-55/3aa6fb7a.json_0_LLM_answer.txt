LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. Each element in the output grid is either the same as or one more than the corresponding element in the input grid, except for the corners, which are zero.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can transform it row by row, starting from the top left corner and moving rightward, then moving down to the next row. Here's how the test output would look like based on the given pattern:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the corners remain unchanged (zero) in both the train and test inputs and outputs.
