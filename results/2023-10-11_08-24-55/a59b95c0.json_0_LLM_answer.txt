LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input values. Each row of the input is transformed into a new row of the output by applying the following operations:

1. The first value of the input row is copied to the first position of the output row.
2. The second value of the input row is moved to the second position of the output row, but only if it is not already present in that position. If it is already present, then it is skipped and the next value is moved instead.
3. The third value of the input row is moved to the third position of the output row, but only if it is not already present in that position. If it is already present, then it is skipped and the next value is moved instead.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to obtain the test output:

test input:
4, 3, 2
2, 1, 4
3, 1, 2

First row:
4 -> 4
3 -> 3
2 -> 2

Second row:
2 -> 2
1 -> 1
4 -> 4

Third row:
3 -> 3
1 -> 1
2 -> 2

Therefore, the test output would be:

4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2
