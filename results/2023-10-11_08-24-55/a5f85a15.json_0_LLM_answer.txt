[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple rotation of the digits in each row by a certain number of positions. Specifically, it seems that each row is rotated by a number of positions equal to the number of digits in that row minus the number of digits in the previous row.

For example, in the first train input, the first row has two digits (2 and 0), so it is rotated by 1 position (since 2 - 1 = 1). The second row has three digits (0, 2, and 0), so it is rotated by 2 positions (since 3 - 1 = 2). The third row has two digits (0 and 2), so it is rotated by 1 position (since 2 - 1 = 1).

In the second train input, the first row has nine digits (0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), so it is rotated by 8 positions (since 9 - 1 = 8). The second row has eight digits (0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0), so it is rotated by 7 positions (since 8 - 1 = 7). The third row has seven digits (0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0), so it is rotated by 6 positions (since 7 - 1 = 6).

The pattern continues in this way for the remaining train inputs and outputs.

Therefore, to solve the test input, we need to rotate each row by the appropriate number of positions based on the number of digits in that row and the previous row. Here's how the test input and output would look after applying the pattern:

Test Input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6
6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0

Test Output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6,
