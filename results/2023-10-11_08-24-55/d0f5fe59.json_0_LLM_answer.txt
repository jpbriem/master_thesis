LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern appears to be:

1. If there are no 8's in the input row, the output is 0.
2. If there is one 8 in the input row, the output is 8.
3. If there are two 8's in the input row, the output is 0.
4. If there are three 8's in the input row, the output is 8.
5. If there are four 8's in the input row, the output is 0.
6. If there are five 8's in the input row, the output is 8.
7. If there are six 8's in the input row, the output is 0.
8. If there are seven 8's in the input row, the output is 8.
9. If there are eight 8's in the input row, the output is 0.
10. If there are nine 8's in the input row, the output is 8.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0 -> 8
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0 -> 8
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
