LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input corresponds to a specific number of positions down the grid, where the value at each position is either 0 (representing an empty space) or a non-zero value (representing a filled space).

To solve the puzzle, we need to determine the correct placement of the non-zero values in the output grid, based on the given input. Let's analyze the training data:

1. In the first row of the input, we have three consecutive zeroes, followed by five consecutive non-zero values. This suggests that the first three positions in the output grid should be filled with zeros, while the next five positions should be filled with the corresponding non-zero values.
2. In the second row of the input, we have two consecutive zeroes, followed by four consecutive non-zero values. This suggests that the first two positions in the output grid should be filled with zeros, while the next four positions should be filled with the corresponding non-zero values.
3. In the third row of the input, we have three consecutive zeroes, followed by five consecutive non-zero values. This suggests that the first three positions in the output grid should be filled with zeros, while the next five positions should be filled with the corresponding non-zero values.
4. In the fourth row of the input, we have four consecutive zeroes, followed by four consecutive non-zero values. This suggests that the first four positions in the output grid should be filled with zeros, while the next four positions should be filled with the corresponding non-zero values.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following general pattern for the puzzle:

* Fill the first n positions in the output grid with zeros, where n is the number of consecutive zeroes in the input.
* Fill the next m positions in the output grid with the corresponding non-zero values, where m is the number of consecutive non-zero values in the input.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

We fill the first four positions in the output grid with zeros:

0, 0, 0, 0

Then, we fill the next five positions with the corresponding non-zero values:

0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Can you please provide me with the actual output for the test input, so I can verify my answer?
