LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that the output is equal to the number of distinct values in the input row, minus the number of times that value appears in the row.

To explain this further, let's call the distinct values in the input row "A", "B", and "C". The output would be calculated as follows:

* If A appears once in the row, B appears once in the row, and C appears once in the row, then the output would be 3 (the number of distinct values).
* If A appears twice in the row, B appears once in the row, and C appears once in the row, then the output would be 2 (the number of distinct values minus the number of times A appears).
* If A appears three times in the row, B appears zero times in the row, and C appears once in the row, then the output would be 1 (the number of distinct values minus the number of times A appears plus the number of times C appears).

Using this pattern, we can now calculate the test output for the given test input:

Test input: 2, 0, 2

Distinct values: 2, 0, 2
Number of distinct values: 3
Output: 3 - 1 = 2

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is 2.
