LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits, where each digit is either 0, 2, 4, or 8. The digits are arranged in a 2D grid, with each row containing a sequence of digits that alternate between 0 and the other three digits.

To generate the test output, we can apply this pattern to the test input by starting with the first row and iteratively filling in the missing values based on the pattern. Here's one possible way to do it:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0

First row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
Fourth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
Fifth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
Sixth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
Seventh row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
Eighth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
Ninth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
Tenth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0

Based on this pattern, the test output would be:

test output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible way to generate the test output based on the pattern in the train inputs and outputs. There may be other ways to interpret the pattern and generate the output, depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
