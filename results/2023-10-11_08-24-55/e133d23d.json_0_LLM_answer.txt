LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row of the input, the corresponding row of the output is obtained by shifting the digits one position to the right, filling in any leading zeros, and then taking the last three digits.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can first convert it into a 2D grid representation:

0 6 6 4 0 0 8
0 6 0 4 8 8 8
6 0 6 4 0 0 0

Then, we can apply the shift and fill operation to obtain the test output:

0 6 6 4 0 0 8
0 6 0 4 8 8 8
6 0 6 4 0 0 0

The resulting test output would be:

2 0 2
0 2 2
2 2 0
