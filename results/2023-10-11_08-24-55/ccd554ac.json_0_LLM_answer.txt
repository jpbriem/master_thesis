[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shifted grid relative to the original grid.

The modifications appear to be applied in the following order:

1. If the shifted grid overlaps with the original grid, the values in the overlap region are replaced with the maximum value from the two grids (i.e., the larger of the two values at each position).
2. If the shifted grid does not overlap with the original grid, the values in the shifted grid are left unchanged.
3. The process is repeated for multiple shifts, with each shift being applied in a different direction (i.e., horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
4. Finally, the resulting grid is returned as the output.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rules for transforming the input grid into the output grid:

1. If the input grid has a value of 0 at a certain position, the output grid will have the same value (0) at that position.
2. If the input grid has a value of 2 at a certain position, the output grid will have a value of 2 at that position if the shifted grid overlaps with the original grid at that position, otherwise it will have a value of 0.
3. If the input grid has a value of 8 at a certain position, the output grid will have a value of 8 at that position if the shifted grid overlaps with the original grid at that position, otherwise it will have a value of 0.

Now, let's apply these rules to the test input:

test input: 0, 8, 8, 0, 0

First shift: (0, 1)
New grid: 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
Modified values: None

Second shift: (1, 0)
New grid: 0, 8, 8, 0, 8
Modified values: 8 -> 2

Third shift: (1, 1)
New grid: 0, 2, 8, 0, 8
Modified values: 8 -> 2, 8 -> 2

Fourth shift: (0, -1)
New grid: 0, 2, 8, 0, 2
Modified values: 2 -> 0

Final output: 0, 2, 8, 0, 2

Therefore, the test output would be:

test output: 0, 2, 8, 0, 2
