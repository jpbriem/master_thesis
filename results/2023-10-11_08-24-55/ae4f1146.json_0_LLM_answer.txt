LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each example, the output grid has the same shape as the input grid, but with some cells modified based on their position and value.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by examining the first row of the input grid. The first cell (8) remains unchanged in the output grid. The second cell (8) becomes an 8 in the output grid if it is located in the same column as the first cell, and otherwise it becomes a 1. The third cell (8) becomes an 8 in the output grid if it is located in the same row as the first cell, and otherwise it becomes a 1. The fourth cell (0) remains unchanged in the output grid.

Using this logic, we can fill out the rest of the output grid as follows:

* Second row: The first cell (8) becomes a 1, since it is in the same column as the first cell of the previous row. The second cell (8) becomes an 8, since it is in the same row as the first cell of the previous row. The third cell (8) becomes a 1, since it is in the same column as the first cell of the previous row. The fourth cell (0) remains unchanged.
* Third row: The first cell (1) becomes a 1, since it is in the same column as the first cell of the previous row. The second cell (8) becomes an 8, since it is in the same row as the first cell of the previous row. The third cell (8) becomes a 1, since it is in the same column as the first cell of the previous row. The fourth cell (0) remains unchanged.
* Fourth row: The first cell (8) becomes an 8, since it is in the same row as the first cell of the previous row. The second cell (1) becomes a 1, since it is in the same column as the first cell of the previous row. The third cell (8) becomes an 8, since it is in the same row as the first cell of the previous row. The fourth cell (0) remains unchanged.

Applying this logic to the entire test input grid, we obtain the following test output:

8, 1, 8, 0
1, 8, 1, 0
8, 1, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

8, 1, 8
1, 8, 1
8, 1, 8
0, 0, 0, 0
