[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the current state of those cells.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Replace a group of cells with a copy of a different group of cells (e.g., copying the top row to the bottom row).
2. Replace a group of cells with a modified version of the same group of cells (e.g., changing the value of every cell in a row by some amount).
3. Swap two groups of cells (e.g., swapping the left and right halves of a row).

The order in which these transformations are applied seems to be important, as the output for a particular transformation depends on the result of the previous transformation.

Given this information, we can now apply these transformations to the test input to obtain the test output:

1. Apply transformation 1 to the test input:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

After applying the first transformation, we get:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0
