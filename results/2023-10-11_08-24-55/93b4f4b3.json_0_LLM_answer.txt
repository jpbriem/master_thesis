[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the current state of the grid.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Repeatedly replace the top row with the value 1, until there are no more 1s in the top row.
2. Replace the second row with the value 2, but only if the first cell in the row is already 2.
3. Replace the third row with the value 3, but only if the first two cells in the row are already 3.
4. Replace the fourth row with the value 4, but only if the first three cells in the row are already 4.
5. Replace the fifth row with the value 5, but only if the first four cells in the row are already 5.
6. If there are any remaining cells in the grid that have not been replaced by the above transformations, set their value to 0.

Applying these transformations to the test input should result in the following output:
