[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output value at position (i, j) is equal to the number of cells in the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to i and less than or equal to j.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it with the values from the test input. Then, we can use the same rules as before to determine the output values for each cell in the grid.

Here's how the test input grid would look like:
```
2 8
1 4
3 4
```
And here's how the test output grid would look like, applying the pattern learned from the training data:
```
0 2 1 4 0
2 2 1 4 4
8 8 0 2 2
3 3 2 8 8
0 3 2 8 0
```
Therefore, the test output would be:

0 2 1 4 0
2 2 1 4 4
8 8 0 2 2
3 3 2 8 8
0 3 2 8 0
