LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 3 positions
2. Shift up (vertically) by 2 positions
3. Shift right (horizontally) by 3 positions
4. Shift down (vertically) by 2 positions
5. Apply logical AND operation to the resulting grid and the original grid

The test input does not contain any values other than 0 and 8, so we can assume that the logic applies to binary grids only. Therefore, the test output would be obtained by applying the same sequence of transformations to the test input and preserving the values (0 or 8) at each position. Here's how the test output would look like:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2
0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the last row of the test input contains only zeros, so the corresponding row in the test output will also contain only zeros.
