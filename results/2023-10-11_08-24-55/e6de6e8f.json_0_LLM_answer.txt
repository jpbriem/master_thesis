LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 2s, with an occasional 3 in the output. It can be described as follows:

1. Start with an arbitrary number of 0s.
2. Write a 2 followed by two 0s.
3. Write a 0 followed by two 2s.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the row.
5. For the last element of the row, write a 0 if the previous element was a 2, and a 2 if it was a 0.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0

Note that this pattern simply generates an alternating sequence of 0s and 2s, without any regard for the values in the input. Therefore, it does not matter what values are used in the input; the output will always follow the same pattern.
