LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in the input grid to the corresponding values in the output grid. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input grid is mapped to a specific value in the output grid, based on its position in the grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

* The first row of the input grid (index 0) always maps to the first column of the output grid (index 0).
* The second row of the input grid (index 1) always maps to the second column of the output grid (index 1).
* The third row of the input grid (index 2) always maps to the third column of the output grid (index 2).
* The fourth row of the input grid (index 3) always maps to the fourth column of the output grid (index 3).
* The fifth row of the input grid (index 4) always maps to the fifth column of the output grid (index 4).
* The sixth row of the input grid (index 5) always maps to the sixth column of the output grid (index 5).
* The seventh row of the input grid (index 6) always maps to the seventh column of the output grid (index 6).
* The eighth row of the input grid (index 7) always maps to the eighth column of the output grid (index 7).
* The ninth row of the input grid (index 8) always maps to the ninth column of the output grid (index 8).

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0, 1, 0
1, 1, 1
0, 1, 1
End of example.

Note that the pattern applies to each row of the input grid independently, so the values in each row are processed separately. Also, the pattern does not depend on the values themselves, but rather their positions in the grid. Therefore, the same pattern can be applied to any 2D grid of values, regardless of their actual values.
