LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern that can be observed is that the input grid is transformed into an output grid by applying a series of logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) to the input values. The specific operation applied to each cell depends on its position in the grid and the values of its neighbors.

To summarize, the pattern involves the following steps:

1. Starting from the top-left corner, iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each cell in the row, perform a logical AND operation with its neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
3. If the result of the AND operation is non-zero, set the output value of the current cell to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each row in the input grid.
5. Return the resulting output grid as the final answer.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input provided:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

test output:
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
