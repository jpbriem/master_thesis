LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
0, 5, 0
5, 5, 2
0, 0, 0
train output:
0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0
5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
train input:
3, 0, 0
2, 3, 0
2, 1, 8
0, 1, 0
train output:
3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
2, 3, 0, 2, 3, 0
2, 1, 8, 2, 1, 8
0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0
End of example.
train input:
5, 2, 3, 0

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some elements possibly being modified along the way. Specifically, it seems that whenever a value of 5 appears in the input, it is replaced by a value of 2 in the output.

Therefore, to get the test output from the test input, we can simply copy each row of the test input to the corresponding position in the test output, making sure to replace any occurrences of 5 with 2. Here's how this would look:

test input:
4, 0, 0, 0
4, 5, 0, 0
0, 5, 6, 0
6, 6, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 1

test output:
4, 0, 0, 0
4, 2, 0, 0
0, 2, 6, 0
6, 6, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 1

So the test output would be:

4, 0, 0, 0
4, 2, 0, 0
0, 2, 6, 0
6, 6, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 1
