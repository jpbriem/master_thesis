LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where the value in each cell is copied to its neighboring cells, with some exceptions.

The rules for this pattern are as follows:

1. If a cell has a value of 4, it will copy that value to its left, right, top, and bottom neighbors.
2. If a cell has a value of 0, it will copy the value of its left or right neighbor (whichever has a value of 4) to its top and bottom neighbors.
3. If a cell has a value of 4 and its left or right neighbor has a value of 0, it will copy the value of its top or bottom neighbor (whichever has a value of 4) to its left or right neighbor.

Applying these rules to the test input, we can determine the test output as follows:

1. The first row has a value of 0 in every cell, so the second row will have a value of 4 in every cell.
2. The third row has a value of 4 in every cell, so the fourth row will have a value of 4 in every cell.
3. The fifth row has a value of 0 in every cell, so the sixth row will have a value of 4 in every cell.
4. The seventh row has a value of 4 in every cell, so the eighth row will have a value of 4 in every cell.
5. The ninth row has a value of 0 in every cell, so the tenth row will have a value of 4 in every cell.

Therefore, the test output is:

0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
