LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the highest number in each row to the corresponding position in the output row, with the remaining positions filled with 0s.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply map the highest number in each row to the corresponding position in the output row, filling in the rest of the positions with 0s.

Here's how this would look for the test input:

| 3 | 8 | 8 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The highest number in each row is marked in bold.

Applying the pattern to the test input gives us the following test output:

| **3** | **8** | **8** | **3** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2** | **1** | **1** | **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **1** | **3** | **3** | **1** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **2** | **1** | **1** | **2** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Note that the test output has the same structure as the train outputs, with the highest number in each row mapped to the corresponding position in the output row, and the rest of the positions filled with 0s.
