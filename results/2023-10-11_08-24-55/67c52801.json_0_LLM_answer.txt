[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a row of zeros with a copy of a neighboring row, possibly shifted by one position. The goal seems to be to transform the input grid into a specific target grid.

Here's a summary of the observed patterns:

1. In the first two examples, the input grid has a single row of non-zero values, which is duplicated in the output grid.
2. In the third example, the input grid has multiple rows of non-zero values, but only the topmost row is duplicated in the output grid.
3. In the fourth example, the input grid has a single row of non-zero values, which is shifted one position to the right in the output grid.
4. In the fifth example, the input grid has multiple rows of non-zero values, but only the bottommost row is shifted one position to the right in the output grid.
5. In the sixth example, the input grid has a single row of non-zero values, which is both duplicated and shifted one position to the right in the output grid.

Based on these observations, it seems likely that the test input grid will also require some combination of duplication and shifting to produce the corresponding test output grid. Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to determine the exact transformation required for the test input grid.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer for the test output without additional context or information about the expected pattern. However, I can suggest some possible approaches to solving this problem:

1. Look for commonalities between the training examples and try to generalize a pattern that can be applied to the test input.
2. Try to find a way to represent the transformations applied to the training inputs in a more abstract or compact form, such as using matrices or functions.
3. Consider the possibility that the training data may not cover all possible cases, and that there may be other transformations that need to be applied to the test input.
4. If you have access to the source code or the person who created the training data, ask for clarification or additional information about the expected pattern.
