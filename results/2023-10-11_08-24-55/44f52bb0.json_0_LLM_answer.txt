[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that the output is equal to the number of 2's in the input row, as long as there are at least two 2's in the row. If there are fewer than two 2's, the output is 1.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test input: 2, 0, 2
Number of 2's: 2
Output: 2

test input: 2, 2, 2
Number of 2's: 3
Output: 3

test input: 2, 0, 2
Number of 2's: 2
Output: 2

So, the test output would be: 2, 3, 2.
