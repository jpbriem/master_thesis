LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 1s, where each row has exactly two 1s and all other elements are 0. The specific pattern seems to be:

* Start with a 0 in the first cell of each row.
* Place a 1 in the second cell of each row.
* Place a 0 in the third cell of each row.
* If the fourth cell of the row is 0, place a 1 there. Otherwise (i.e., if it's already 1), place a 0.
* Fill the rest of the row with alternating 0s and 1s, starting with whichever value (0 or 1) was just placed in the fourth cell.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values of the test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the above pattern to the test input yields the following output:

test output:
0, 0, 5, 9
7, 7, 5, 9
0, 5, 7, 0
