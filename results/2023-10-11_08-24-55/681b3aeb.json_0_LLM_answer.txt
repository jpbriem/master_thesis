LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the highest number in each row to the corresponding position in the output.

In the first set of examples, the output is simply the highest number in each row. In the second set, the output is the highest number in each row, shifted by one position to the right. In the third set, the output is the highest number in each row, shifted by two positions to the right.

Therefore, to determine the test output, we can simply find the highest number in each row of the test input and map it to the corresponding position in the output.

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Test output:
8, 8, 8
