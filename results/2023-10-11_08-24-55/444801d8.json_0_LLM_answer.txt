LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shift.

The modifications appear to be as follows:

* When the grid is shifted horizontally or vertically by a non-zero amount, the values in the grid are unchanged.
* When the grid is shifted diagonally by a non-zero amount, the values in the grid are either increased or decreased by 1, depending on the position of the shift.
* When the grid is shifted by a zero amount (i.e., no shift is applied), the values in the grid are modified such that all 0s become 1s, and all 1s become 0s.

Based on this pattern, we can create a general formula to describe the transformation being applied to the input grid:

Let G be the input grid, and let S be the shift vector (which can take on the values -1, 0, or 1). Let M be a mask that indicates which elements of G should be modified (M(i, j) = 1 if the element at position (i, j) should be modified, and M(i, j) = 0 otherwise).

Then, the transformed grid T can be calculated as follows:

T(i, j) = (1 - M(i, j)) * G(i + S(1), j + S(2)) + M(i, j) * (1 - G(i + S(1), j + S(2)))

where S(1) and S(2) are the horizontal and vertical components of the shift vector S, respectively.

Using this formula, we can transform the input grid according to the specified shift, and then apply the modification indicated by the mask M.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input grid:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0

We can start by calculating the shift vector S:

S = (1, 1)

This means that we need to shift the grid one position to the right and one position down.

Next, we can calculate the mask M:

M = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

This means that we need to modify all elements of the grid.

Now, we can apply the transformation using the formula above:

T(i, j) = (1 - M(i, j)) * G(i + S(1), j + S(2)) + M(i, j) * (1 - G(i + S(1), j + S(2)))

= (1 - 1) * G(i + 1, j + 1) + 1 * (1 - G(i + 1, j + 1))

= G(i + 1, j + 1) - G(i + 1, j + 1)

= 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

test output:
0, 0
