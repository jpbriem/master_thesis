[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each row of the input grid consists of a sequence of 0s and 1s, with each digit being determined by the previous two digits. Specifically, the pattern seems to be:

* If the previous two digits are the same (either both 0 or both 1), then the current digit is the opposite of the previous digit.
* If the previous two digits are different (one 0 and one 1), then the current digit is the same as the previous digit.

Using this pattern, we can generate the missing values for the test input as follows:

test input:
6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3

Using the pattern, we can start by looking at the first three digits: 6, 8, 6. The previous two digits are different (6 and 8), so the next digit should be the same as the previous digit, which is 6. Therefore, the fourth digit should be 6.

The fifth digit is also easy to determine since the previous two digits are the same (6 and 6). Following the pattern, the fifth digit should be the opposite of the previous digit, which is 6. Therefore, the fifth digit should be 1.

Finally, the sixth digit is also easy to determine since the previous two digits are different (1 and 6). Using the pattern again, the sixth digit should be the same as the previous digit, which is 1.

Therefore, the completed test input with the generated values is:
6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 6, 1

Based on the given training data, the expected test output would be:
3, 5, 7, 6, 3, 5, 7, 6
