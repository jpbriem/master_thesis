LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be that the output is the maximum value in the input row that is not zero.

Therefore, the answer for the test input would be:

3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9

The maximum value in each row that is not zero is 3, so the output for the test input would be:

3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9
