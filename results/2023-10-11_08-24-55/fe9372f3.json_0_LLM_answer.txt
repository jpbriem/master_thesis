LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, we can observe that the pattern involves filling in the missing values in the input grid with values from the surrounding cells. The output for each row is determined by the number of 2s in that row, with the following rules:

* If there are an odd number of 2s in the row, the output is 1.
* If there are an even number of 2s in the row, the output is 0.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1

The reasoning behind this solution is based on the observation that the patterns in the training data involve filling in the missing values with values from the surrounding cells. In each row, the output is determined by the number of 2s in that row, following the rules mentioned above. Therefore, by analyzing the test input, we can determine the missing values and fill them in accordingly to get the test output.
