LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a rotation to the resulting grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be consistent across all the training examples.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. First, the input grid is shifted horizontally by 3 positions to the right.
2. Next, the grid is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Then, the grid is shifted vertically by 2 positions down.
4. After that, the grid is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
5. Finally, the grid is shifted horizontally by 3 positions to the left.

Applying this pattern to the test input should give us the test output. Here's how the test input would be transformed at each step:

1. Shift horizontally by 3 positions to the right:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9
 becomes
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
2. Rotate clockwise by 90 degrees:
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9
becomes
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9
3. Shift vertically by 2 positions down:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9
becomes
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9
4. Rotate counterclockwise by 90 degrees:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9
becomes
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9
5. Shift horizontally by 3 positions to the left:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9
becomes
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9
