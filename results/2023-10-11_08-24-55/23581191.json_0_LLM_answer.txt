LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where the values in the input grid are copied to the corresponding positions in the output grid, with some minor modifications.

The modified values are:

* The top-left corner (0, 0) is changed to 8 in the first train output pair.
* The bottom-right corner (0, 0) is changed to 7 in the second train output pair.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
