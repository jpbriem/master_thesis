LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid represents a binary number (where 0s represent 0 and 1s represent 1). The task is to find the highest binary number in each row and then convert it into a decimal number.

To achieve this, we can start by scanning each row of the input grid from left to right and keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far. Whenever we encounter a 1, we increment the maximum value by 1. If we encounter a 0, we do nothing. At the end of each row, we output the maximum value encountered during that row.

Using this logic, the test output for the given test input would be:

4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the first row has a maximum value of 4, which is output as 4. The second row has a maximum value of 8, which is output as 8. The third and fourth rows have a maximum value of 2, which is output as 2. The fifth row has a maximum value of 4, which is output as 4. The remaining rows are all zero, so they output 0.
