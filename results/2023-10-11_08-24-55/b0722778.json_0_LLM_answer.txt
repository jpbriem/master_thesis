LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of numbers. Each number in the input is either 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, or 9, and the corresponding output is always two numbers after it in the sequence.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can simply apply this pattern to the test input. Here's how the pattern would look when applied to the test input:

test input:
1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4

Pattern:
2, 4, 0, 5, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4

Output:
6, 8

Next row:
2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4

Pattern:
4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 4

Output:
8, 8

And so on...

Therefore, the test output would be:
6, 8
8, 8
0, 0
4, 5
4, 5
0, 0
8, 8
8, 3

Note that this is just one possible way to arrive at a solution. There may be other ways to interpret the pattern in the train input and output pairs, but this seems like a straightforward and consistent approach.
