LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the number of 3s in each row to the corresponding output.

For each row, count the number of 3s. If there are no 3s, the output is 0. If there is one 3, the output is 1. If there are two or more 3s, the output is 2.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Number of 3s: 0
Output: 0

test input: 0, 3, 3, 0, 0
Number of 3s: 2
Output: 2

test input: 0, 3, 3, 0, 0
Number of 3s: 2
Output: 2

test input: 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
Number of 3s: 0
Output: 0

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
Number of 3s: 1
Output: 1

test input: 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
Number of 3s: 2
Output: 2

test input: 3, 3, 0, 2, 2
Number of 3s: 2
Output: 2

test input: 0, 0, 0, 2, 2
Number of 3s: 0
Output: 0

Therefore, the test output is:

1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0
