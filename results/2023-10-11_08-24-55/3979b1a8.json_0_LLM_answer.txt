[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the number of cells in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output cell value is equal to the number of cells in the same row as the input cell, multiplied by the number of cells in the same column as the input cell.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a 2D grid with the same dimensions as the test input, and fill it with the values from the test input. Then, we can transform the grid using the same rules as before, and produce the test output.

Here's how the test input and output would look like after applying the pattern:

Test Input:
5, 1, 1, 1, 5
1, 1, 9, 1, 1
1, 9, 9, 9, 1
1, 1, 9, 1, 1
5, 1, 1, 1, 5

Test Output:
5, 4, 4, 4, 5
4, 4, 7, 4, 4
4, 7, 7, 7, 4
4, 4, 7, 4, 4
5, 4, 4, 4, 5

Note that the values in the test output are not necessarily the same as the values in the train output, since the test input is different from the train input. However, the pattern used to generate the output should be consistent across both sets of data.
