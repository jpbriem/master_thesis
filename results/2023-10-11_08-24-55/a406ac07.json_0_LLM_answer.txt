LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a rotation to the resulting grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be consistent across all the training examples.

Here's a summary of the pattern I observed:

1. Shift the grid by (-1, -1) (i.e., one position to the left and one position up).
2. Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Shift the grid by (1, -1) (i.e., one position to the right and one position up).
4. Rotate the grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
5. Shift the grid by (-1, 1) (i.e., one position to the left and one position down).
6. Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
7. Shift the grid by (1, 1) (i.e., one position to the right and one position down).
8. Rotate the grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to obtain the test output:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3

1. Shift the grid by (-1, -1): 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
2. Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
3. Shift the grid by (1, -1): 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
4. Rotate the grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
5. Shift the grid by (-1, 1): 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
6. Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
7. Shift the grid by (1, 1): 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
8. Rotate the grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3

Therefore, the test output would be:

test output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
