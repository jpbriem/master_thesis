LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern that can be observed is that the output values are always equal to the maximum value among the input values, except for the cases where the input values are all zero, in which case the output value is also zero.

Therefore, to determine the output value for the given test input, we need to find the maximum value among the input values. The test input values are:

0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0
0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0

The maximum value among these input values is 8, which occurs three times in the third row. Therefore, the output value for this test input would be 8.
