[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 1 position
2. Shift up (vertically) by 1 position
3. Shift right (horizontally) by 1 position
4. Shift down (vertically) by 1 position
5. Apply logical AND operation to the resulting grid and the original grid

The test input does not contain any 2s or 3s, so we can't apply the same logic directly. However, we can modify the pattern slightly to accommodate this. Here's one possible way to solve the test input using the observed pattern:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 1 position
2. Shift up (vertically) by 1 position
3. Shift right (horizontally) by 1 position
4. Shift down (vertically) by 1 position
5. Apply logical AND operation to the resulting grid and the original grid
6. Since there are no 2s or 3s in the test input, we can simply fill the entire grid with 0s and apply the above operations. This will effectively "erase" the existing values in the grid and result in a new grid that contains only 0s and 1s.

Using this modified pattern, we can now apply the six steps to the test input:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 1 position:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
2. Shift up (vertically) by 1 position:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
3. Shift right (horizontally) by 1 position:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
4. Shift down (vertically) by 1 position:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
5. Apply logical AND operation to the resulting grid and the original grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
6. Fill the entire grid with 0s and apply the above operations:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the test output would be:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
