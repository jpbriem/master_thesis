[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple rotation of the digits in each row by a fixed number of positions (a Caesar cipher). The number of positions is different for each row, but it seems to increase by 1 for each row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we need to rotate each row by the corresponding number of positions. Here's how the rotations would look like:

Row 1: Rotate by 1 position (0 -> 4, 0 -> 2, 0 -> 0)
Row 2: Rotate by 2 positions (0 -> 0, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0)
Row 3: Rotate by 3 positions (0 -> 0, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0)
Row 4: Rotate by 4 positions (0 -> 4, 0 -> 2, 0 -> 0)
Row 5: Rotate by 5 positions (0 -> 0, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0)
Row 6: Rotate by 6 positions (0 -> 0, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0)
Row 7: Rotate by 7 positions (0 -> 0, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0)
Row 8: Rotate by 8 positions (0 -> 4, 0 -> 2, 0 -> 0)
Row 9: Rotate by 9 positions (0 -> 0, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0)

After applying these rotations, we get the following test output:
