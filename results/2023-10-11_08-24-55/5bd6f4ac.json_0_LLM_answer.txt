LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that each cell in the output grid is equal to the number of cells in the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to the value of the cell in the output grid.

For example, in the first train input and output pair, the output value at position (1, 1) is 9, which is the number of cells in the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to 9. Similarly, the output value at position (2, 2) is 7, which is the number of cells in the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to 7.

Based on this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the train input and output pairs as follows:

train input:
3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 7, 0
8, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 8, 4
1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
1, 1, 0, 9, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 0, 1, 7, 0, 8, 4, 0
0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 2, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0

train output:
9, 7, 0
4, 8, 4
4, 0, 0

The test input is:
6, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 8, 9
2, 9, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 0
9, 2, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 8
7, 7, 4, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 5, 7, 4
4, 1, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 9
9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
4, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0

Using the same pattern, we can predict the test output as follows:

test output:
18, 17, 0
13, 18, 4
13, 0, 0
17, 2, 6
17, 7, 4
18, 7, 0
18, 1, 0
17, 1, 4
18, 4, 0
18, 9, 2
