LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that every four digits, a new digit is introduced, and the previous four digits are repeated. Specifically:

* In the first row, the digits 0, 0, 0, and 0 are repeated four times.
* In the second row, the digit 8 is introduced, and the previous four digits (0, 0, 0, and 0) are repeated three times.
* In the third row, the digit 4 is introduced, and the previous four digits (0, 0, 0, and 8) are repeated three times.
* In the fourth row, the digit 6 is introduced, and the previous four digits (0, 0, 4, and 8) are repeated three times.
* In the fifth row, the digit 8 is reintroduced, and the previous four digits (0, 0, 6, and 8) are repeated three times.

Using this pattern, we can predict the next four digits for the test input:

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3
0, 0, 3, 3
0, 3, 3, 3

The predicted output for the test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3
0, 0, 3, 3
0, 3, 3, 3
