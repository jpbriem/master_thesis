LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each row of the input grid consists of eight digits, with each digit being either 0, 1, 2, 8, or a combination of these values. The output for each row is the last digit of the row, which is either 0, 1, 2, 8, or a combination of these values.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply look at the last digit of each row and use that as the output for that row. Here's how the test input and output would look:

Test Input:
2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0
1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 1, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0
0, 1, 2, 8, 2, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0
0, 8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Test Output:
2, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 1, 8
1, 2, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 2
8, 2, 8, 1
8, 1, 8, 8
2, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 1
8, 1, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0

The test output is simply the last digit of each row of the test input, which matches the pattern observed in the training data.
