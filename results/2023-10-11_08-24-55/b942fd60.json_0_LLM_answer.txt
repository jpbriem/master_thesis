LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is transformed into a single output value. The transformation involves applying a series of operations to the values in each row, where the operations are determined by the positions of the values in the row.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. The first value in each row is multiplied by 2.
2. The second value in each row is multiplied by 3.
3. The third value in each row is multiplied by 4.
4. The fourth value in each row is multiplied by 5.
5. The fifth value in each row is multiplied by 6.
6. The sixth value in each row is multiplied by 7.
7. The seventh value in each row is multiplied by 8.
8. The eighth value in each row is set to 0.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to get the test output:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3

1. The first value (0) is multiplied by 2 = 0.
2. The second value (0) is multiplied by 3 = 0.
3. The third value (0) is multiplied by 4 = 0.
4. The fourth value (8) is multiplied by 5 = 40.
5. The fifth value (0) is multiplied by 6 = 0.
6. The sixth value (0) is multiplied by 7 = 0.
7. The seventh value (7) is multiplied by 8 = 56.
8. The eighth value (3) is set to 0.

Therefore, the test output would be: 0, 0, 0, 40, 0, 0, 56, 0, 0, 0, 0.
