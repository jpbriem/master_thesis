LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
0, 0, 6
0, 4, 0
3, 0, 0
train output:
0, 0, 6
0, 4, 6
3, 4, 6
End of example.
train input:
0, 2, 0
7, 0, 8
0, 0, 0
train output:
0, 2, 0
7, 2, 8
7, 2, 8
End of example.
train input:
4, 0, 0
0, 2, 0
0, 0, 0
train output:
4, 0, 0
4, 2, 0
4, 2, 0
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some modifications. Specifically:

* The first element of the input is unchanged in the output.
* The second element of the input is incremented by 2 in the output.
* The third element of the input is unchanged in the output.

Therefore, the test output would be:

test output:
4, 0, 8
0, 2, 0
0, 7, 0

This can be achieved by applying the same logic to the test input as was applied to the training input.
