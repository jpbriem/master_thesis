LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 1s, with an occasional 2 or 4 thrown in. There doesn't seem to be any discernible logic behind the placement of these numbers, and the pattern doesn't appear to repeat after a certain number of steps.

Given this, it's difficult to predict what the next number in the sequence would be, especially since there doesn't seem to be any obvious rule governing the pattern. However, based on the given data, one possible continuation of the pattern could be:

8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

This continues the pattern of alternating between 0s and  eight, with the occasional 0 thrown in. Again, it's important to note that there doesn't seem to be any discernible logic behind this pattern, so it's impossible to say for sure what the "correct" next number would be.
