LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. Each row of the input grid is transformed into the corresponding row of the output grid by applying the following operations:

1. Shift the row four positions to the right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).
2. Replace each value in the shifted row with the value that is three positions to its left in the original row (again wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).
3. If the resulting value is zero, replace it with the value that is two positions to its left in the original row (wrapping around to the end of the row if necessary).

Here's an example of how this pattern would transform the first row of the input grid:

Input row: 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
Shifted row: 0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
Replace values: 0, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output row: 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying this pattern to the entire input grid produces the corresponding output grid. Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

Test output: 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
