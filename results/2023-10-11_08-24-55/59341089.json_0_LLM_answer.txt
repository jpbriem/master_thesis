LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, with some elements possibly being modified, and then the resulting rows are concatenated together.

In the first example, the first row (7, 5, 7) is repeated three times, followed by the second row (5, 5, 7) which is also repeated three times, and finally the third row (7, 7, 5) which is repeated twice.

In the second example, the first row (7, 7, 8) is repeated twice, followed by the second row (5, 8, 8) which is repeated twice, and finally the third row (5, 8, 8) which is repeated thrice.

In the third example, the first row (8, 8, 8) is repeated four times, followed by the second row (5, 5, 7) which is repeated thrice, and finally the third row (5, 7, 8) which is repeated twice.

Based on this pattern, the test output for the given test input would be:

test output:
8, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 8, 8, 5
