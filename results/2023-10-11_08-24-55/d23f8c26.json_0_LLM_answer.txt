[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is transformed independently. The transformation involves replacing each digit with a different digit, based on a fixed mapping.

The mapping can be represented as follows:

| Input Digit | Output Digit |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 9 |
| 4 | 0 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 1 |
| 7 | 7 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 2 |

Using this mapping, we can transform each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output row. Here's how the transformation would work for each row of the test input:

1. 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7 -> 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7 (since 3 becomes 9)
2. 8, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0 -> 8, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0 (no change)
3. 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 0, 3 -> 0, 0, 9, 0, 8, 0, 3 (since 3 becomes 9)
4. 0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0 -> 0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0 (no change)
5. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 -> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (no change)
6. 1, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0 -> 3, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0 (since 1 becomes 3)
7. 0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0 -> 0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0 (no change)

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7
8, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 9, 0, 8, 0, 3
0, 7, 0, 1, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
3, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0
