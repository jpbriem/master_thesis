LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of consecutive cells with a new value. Specifically:

1. Replace the first occurrence of five consecutive cells with the value 5.
2. Replace the second occurrence of five consecutive cells with the value 8.
3. Replace the third occurrence of five consecutive cells with the value 5.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more groups of five consecutive cells.

Applying this pattern to the test input should result in the following output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
