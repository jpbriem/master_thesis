LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input corresponds to a specific digit in the output, based on their position in the grid.

Here's a summary of the pattern:

* First row: 0 -> 0
* Second row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 6, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 0
* Third row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 6, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 0
* Fourth row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 6, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 0
* Fifth row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 6, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 0
* Sixth row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 6, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 0
* Seventh row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 7, 2 -> 7, 3 -> 7
* Eighth row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 7, 2 -> 7, 3 -> 7
* Ninth row: 0 -> 0, 1 -> 7, 2 -> 7, 3 -> 7

Based on this pattern, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible way to generate the output for the given input. There may be other ways to interpret the pattern, depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
