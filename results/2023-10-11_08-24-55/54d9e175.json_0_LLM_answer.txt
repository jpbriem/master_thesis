LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the digits in the input grid to corresponding output digits. Specifically, it seems that each digit in the input grid is mapped to a corresponding digit in the output grid, based on its position in the grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

* The first digit in the input grid (representing the top-left corner) is always mapped to the top-left corner of the output grid.
* The second digit in the input grid (representing the middle-left cell) is always mapped to the middle-left cell of the output grid.
* The third digit in the input grid (representing the bottom-left corner) is always mapped to the bottom-left corner of the output grid.
* The fourth digit in the input grid (representing the top-right corner) is always mapped to the top-right corner of the output grid.
* The fifth digit in the input grid (representing the middle-right cell) is always mapped to the middle-right cell of the output grid.
* The sixth digit in the input grid (representing the bottom-right corner) is always mapped to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to get the test output:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0

test output:
9, 9, 9, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9
7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9
7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9
7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9
