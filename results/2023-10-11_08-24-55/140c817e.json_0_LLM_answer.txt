LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be:

1. If there are three consecutive identical digits in the input row, replace the middle digit with 1.
2. If there are two consecutive identical digits in the input row, replace the second digit with 2.
3. If there is only one digit in the input row that is not repeated, replace it with 3.
4. If there are no repeating digits in the input row, leave the input unchanged.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

test input: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Applying the pattern, we get:

test output: 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is: 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
