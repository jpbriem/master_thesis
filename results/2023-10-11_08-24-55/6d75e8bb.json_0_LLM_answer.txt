LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be:

1. If there are no 8s in the input row, the output row will have 0s only.
2. If there is one 8 in the input row, the corresponding output row will have a 2 in that position.
3. If there are two or more 8s in the input row, the corresponding output row will have a 2 in the first position, followed by an 8 in the second position, and then alternating between 2 and 8 for the remaining positions.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this pattern assumes that the input and output rows are treated independently, and there is no relationship between the different rows.
