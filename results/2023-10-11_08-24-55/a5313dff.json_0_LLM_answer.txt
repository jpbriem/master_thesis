LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the current state of those cells.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Replace a group of cells with a 2x2 square of values (e.g., 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 2, 2, 2).
2. Replace a group of cells with a 2x3 rectangle of values (e.g., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).
3. Replace a group of cells with a 3x3 cube of values (e.g., 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).
4. Replace a single cell with a copy of a neighboring cell (e.g., 0 becomes 2 if one of its neighbors is 2).
5. Replace a group of cells with a mirrored version of themselves (e.g., 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 0, 0, 0, 2).

The test input you provided does not follow the same structure as the training data. It appears to be a single row of eight cells, with no obvious pattern or relationship between the values. Therefore, I cannot provide a correct test output for this input using the patterns observed in the training data.
