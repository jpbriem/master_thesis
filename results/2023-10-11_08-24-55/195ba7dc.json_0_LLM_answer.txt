LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 1s and 0s, with the number of 1s equal to the number of 7s in each row.

Therefore, the rule for generating the output from a given input is:

1. Count the number of 7s in each row of the input.
2. Alternate between 1 and 0 for each position in the output, starting from the leftmost position. If the number of 7s in the corresponding row is even, start with 1, otherwise start with 0.

Applying this rule to the test input, we get the following output:

test output:
1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1

Note that this is just one possible way to generate the output from the given input. There may be other valid ways to do it as well.
