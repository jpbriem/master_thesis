[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is transformed independently. The transformation involves replacing each number in the row with a new value based on a fixed mapping.

The mapping can be represented as follows:

0 -> 4
1 -> 3
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 4
5 -> 5
6 -> 6
7 -> 7
8 -> 8
9 -> 1

To apply this mapping to the test input, we simply replace each number in the input grid with the corresponding value from the mapping. Here's the resulting test output:

5 -> 4
4 -> 4
4 -> 4
3 -> 3
3 -> 3
2 -> 2
1 -> 1
1 -> 8
1 -> 8
1 -> 8

Therefore, the test output is:
4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4
3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3
2, 2, 2
1, 8, 8
1, 8, 8
