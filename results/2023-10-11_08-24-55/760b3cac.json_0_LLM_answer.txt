LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions. The shift amount is determined by the value in the first column of the row.

Here's a summary of the pattern:

* If the value in the first column is 0, the row remains unchanged.
* If the value in the first column is 8, the row is shifted one position to the right.
* If the value in the first column is 4, the row is shifted two positions to the right.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply iterate through each row and apply the appropriate shift based on the value in the first column.

Here's the resulting test output:

0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
