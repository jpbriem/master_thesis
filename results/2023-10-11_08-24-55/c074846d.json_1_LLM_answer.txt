LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the current state of the grid.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Replace a group of cells with a copy of a nearby group, shifted by some amount (e.g., left, right, up, down).
2. Replace a group of cells with a modified version of the same group, where each cell is incremented by 1 or decremented by 1.
3. Replace a group of cells with a completely new value, which may be a constant or a function of the current state of the grid.

The goal seems to be to find a sequence of transformations that will transform the initial grid into the desired target grid. In this case, the target grid has a "staircase" shape, with alternating rows of 0s and 2s, and a final row of 5s.

To solve the problem, we can start with an empty grid and apply a series of transformations to gradually build up the desired pattern. Here's one possible sequence of transformations that achieves the target grid:

1. Start with an empty grid.
2. Apply transformation 1 to create a copy of the top row at the bottom row.
3. Apply transformation 2 to modify the middle row, incrementing each cell by 1.
4. Apply transformation 3 to replace the leftmost column with a new value, creating a "staircase" shape.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire grid has been filled with the desired pattern.

Here's the resulting grid after applying these transformations:
