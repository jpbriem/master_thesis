LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input represents a specific number of occurrences of a particular symbol (either 0-8) in the corresponding position in the output.

For example, in the first row of the training data, the input "8" corresponds to an output of "8", indicating that the symbol "8" appears 8 times in the output. Similarly, the input "6" corresponds to an output of "6", indicating that the symbol "6" appears 6 times in the output.

Using this pattern, we can create a general rule for generating the output for a given input. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. Take each digit in the input and substitute it with the corresponding symbol (0-8) based on its position in the input. For example, if the input is "888", then the substituted symbols would be "8" for the first digit, "8" for the second digit, and "8" for the third digit.
2. Count the number of unique symbols in the substituted string. This will give us the number of times each symbol appears in the output. For example, if the substituted string is "888", then there are three 8's, so the output would be "8 3".
3. If there are any duplicate symbols in the substituted string, replace them with a single occurrence of the corresponding symbol. For example, if the substituted string is "888", then we could simplify it to "8 3 8".
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each row of the input, using the corresponding output from the previous row as the input for the next row.

Using this method, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

Test input: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Substitution: 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8, 8 -> 8

Counting unique symbols: 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times), 8 (8 times)

Simplifying duplicates: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8

Therefore, the output for the test input would be: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8.
