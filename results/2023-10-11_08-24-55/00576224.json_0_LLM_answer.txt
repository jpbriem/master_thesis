LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, with the second occurrence shifted by one position to the right. Additionally, there are two "special" rows that appear to be swapped in the output.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can first convert it into a 2D grid representation:

| 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |

Then, we can apply the pattern by duplicating each row and shifting the second occurrence by one position to the right:

| 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |
| 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |

Finally, we can swap the two "special" rows to obtain the test output:

| 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |
| 7 | 8 |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | 2 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

| 3 | 2 |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |
| 7 | 8 |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | 2 |
