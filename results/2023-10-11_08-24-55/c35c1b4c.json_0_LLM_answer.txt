LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of each number to its corresponding output. The mapping is not necessarily linear or mathematical, but rather a direct substitution cipher. Each number from 0 to 9 has a unique corresponding output, which can be seen in the train output columns.

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can simply substitute each number in the test input with its corresponding output from the train output. Here's how it would look like for the first few lines of the test input:

| Test Input | Train Output |
| --- | --- |
| 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0 | 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0 |
| 2, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 2, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 6, 0, 2 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 0, 0 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 2, 6 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 6, 9, 0, 2, 6 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |
| 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 2 | 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6 |

As you can see, the pattern holds true for the first few lines of the test input. However, I cannot guarantee that it will hold true for the entire test input without actually knowing the specific rules and constraints of the problem.
