[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves counting the number of non-zero elements in each row and then applying a modification to the last element of the row based on the count.

Here's a summary of the pattern:

1. Count the number of non-zero elements in each row.
2. If the count is odd, set the last element of the row to 3.
3. If the count is even, set the last element of the row to 2.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 1) - count is 0, so set last element to 2
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 2) - count is 1, so set last element to 3
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 3) - count is 2, so set last element to 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 4) - count is 0, so set last element to 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 5) - count is 0, so set last element to 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 6) - count is 2, so set last element to 2
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 7) - count is 3, so set last element to 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 8) - count is 0, so set last element to 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (row 9) - count is 1, so set last element to 3

Therefore, the test output would be:

2
3
2
2
2
2
3
2
6

Note that the last element of each row is modified based on the count of non-zero elements in that row.
