LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves filling in values in a 2D grid based on certain rules. Here's what I infer from the training data:

1. Initially, all values in the grid are 0.
2. When a value of 1 appears in the grid, it propagates horizontally and vertically to adjacent cells until it reaches the boundary of the grid or another value of 1.
3. When a value of 1 encounters a value of 0, it converts the value of 0 to 3.
4. If two or more values of 1 encounter each other, they all convert to 3.
5. Once all values have been filled in, the output is the maximum value in the grid.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to get the following output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
