LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be that for each row, the first eight cells contain alternating values of 2 and 8, followed by a single value of 2 or 8 in the ninth cell. The tenth cell contains a value of 2 or 8, and the remaining cells are filled with 0s.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2
8, 8, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2
8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2

Note that this pattern does not account for the last two rows of the test input, which contain only 0s. Therefore, the actual output may differ slightly from the predicted pattern.
