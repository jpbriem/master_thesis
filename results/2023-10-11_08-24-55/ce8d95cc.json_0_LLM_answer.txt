LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input row is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output row, based on a fixed mapping.

The mapping can be represented as follows:

0 -> 0
1 -> 3
2 -> 1
3 -> 7
4 -> 8
5 -> 5
6 -> 6
7 -> 2
8 -> 4
9 -> 0

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can simply substitute each digit in the input row using the above mapping, to obtain the corresponding digit in the output row.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 7, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 7, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
