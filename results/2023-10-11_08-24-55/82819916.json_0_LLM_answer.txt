LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shift.

The first transformation shifts the grid by one position to the right (i.e., adding 1 to each element's x-coordinate), and sets the value of the top-left cell to 0.
The second transformation shifts the grid by two positions down (i.e., adding 2 to each element's y-coordinate), and sets the value of the top-right cell to 0.
The third transformation shifts the grid by three positions to the left (i.e., subtracting 3 from each element's x-coordinate), and sets the value of the bottom-left cell to 0.
The fourth transformation shifts the grid by four positions up (i.e., subtracting 4 from each element's y-coordinate), and sets the value of the bottom-right cell to 0.

Therefore, the test output can be obtained by applying these transformations in sequence to the test input grid. Here's how the transformations would be applied:

1. Shift the grid by one position to the right:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

2. Shift the grid by two positions down:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 8,
