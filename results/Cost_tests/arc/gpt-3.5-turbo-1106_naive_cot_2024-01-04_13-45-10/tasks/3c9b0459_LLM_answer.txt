prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': 'Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid in numpy array format.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[b, b, a], [b, a, b], [b, h, a]]
output: [[a, h, b], [b, a, b], [a, b, b]]

Example_2:
input: [[i, b, d], [b, d, d], [b, i, b]]
output: [[b, i, b], [d, d, b], [d, b, i]]

Example_3:
input: [[h, h, h], [e, e, h], [h, e, e]]
output: [[e, e, h], [h, e, e], [h, h, h]]

Example_4:
input: [[c, b, i], [i, i, i], [b, c, c]]
output: [[c, c, b], [i, i, i], [i, b, c]]



Test case:
input: [[f, d, d], [f, f, d], [d, f, g]]

Sample Outputs:
{'grid_changes': 'The dimension of the input grid is the same as its output grid',
 'pixel_changes': 'There are changes in the position of the pixels, with some colors being swapped',
 'object_changes': 'There are changes in the position and color of the objects',
 'overall_pattern': 'The input grid is transformed by swapping certain colors in specific positions',
 'instructions': 'Swap the positions of specific colors based on the given input-output pairs. For example, in the first pair, swap the positions of "a" and "b" in the input grid to get the output grid. Repeat this process for all input-output pairs.',
 'test_output': array([['d', 'f', 'f'],
        ['d', 'd', 'f'],
        ['f', 'd', 'g']], dtype='<U1')}
