            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': 'Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid in numpy array format.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[., ., ., i, ., d], [., f, ., i, ., .], [b, ., ., ., ., .], [., f, ., ., c, .], [b, ., ., i, c, .], [b, ., g, ., ., d]]\noutput: [[., ., ., ., ., .], [., ., ., ., ., .], [., ., ., ., ., .], [b, ., ., i, ., .], [b, f, ., i, c, d], [b, f, g, i, c, d]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[., ., ., ., ., d], [e, ., ., ., ., .], [., h, g, ., ., .], [., ., g, ., ., .], [e, ., ., ., ., .], [e, ., ., ., ., .]]\noutput: [[., ., ., ., ., .], [., ., ., ., ., .], [., ., ., ., ., .], [e, ., ., ., ., .], [e, ., g, ., ., .], [e, h, g, ., ., d]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[., ., e, .], [i, f, e, g], [., f, ., g], [., f, e, g]]\noutput: [[., ., ., .], [., f, e, g], [., f, e, g], [i, f, e, g]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[h, g, ., i, .], [., g, e, ., c], [., ., ., ., .], [., ., ., i, .], [., ., ., i, .]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n```json\n{\n  \"grid_changes\": \"The dimension of the input grid is the same as the output grid.\",\n  \"pixel_changes\": \"The pixels have moved within the grid, and some new pixels have appeared while some old pixels have disappeared.\",\n  \"object_changes\": \"The objects have moved within the grid, and some new objects have appeared while some old objects have disappeared. The shape and size of the objects have also changed.\",\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern involves moving and transforming the positions of the pixels and objects within the grid.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"1.

Move the pixel 'e' to the position (1, 2). 6. Add pixel 'd' to the position (1, 4). 7. Remove pixel 'h' from the position (2, 1). 8.
