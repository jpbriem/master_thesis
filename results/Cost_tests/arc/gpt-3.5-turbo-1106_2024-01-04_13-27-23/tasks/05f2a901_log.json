Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given a description about the dimensions of an input and output grid.\nMoreover, you are given hints to determine parts of interest of the input grid and an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given hints and pattern and analyze if they correctly describe the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all pattern details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'parts_of_interest_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given hints about parts of interest help to determine the parts of interest with all needed characteristics of the input.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, divide the pattern in distinct parts and analyze each part individually: 1. is it part of the transformation from input to output? 2. is it specific enough?', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.
