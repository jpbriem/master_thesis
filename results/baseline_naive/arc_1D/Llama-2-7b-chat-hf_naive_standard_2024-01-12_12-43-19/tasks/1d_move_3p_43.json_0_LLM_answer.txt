LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', '.']

Explanation:
The given string is transformed by replacing each occurrence of a single character ('.') with the next character in the alphabet (the first letter of the string). If there are no more characters left to replace, the last occurrence of the original character is kept. This process is repeated until all occurrences of the original character have been replaced or there are no more characters left to replace.

For example, in Example 1, the input string contains eight occurrences of the character '.', which are replaced with the next character in the alphabet ('h'). Since there are still seven remaining occurrences of the original character, six of them are replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and so on. In the end, only one occurrence of the original character remains.

In Example 2, the input string contains ten occurrences of the character 'd', which are replaced with the next character in the alphabet ('d'). Since there are still ten occurrences of the original character left after replacing the first ten, they are all replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and so on. In the end, none of the original characters remain.

In Example 3, the input string consists entirely of the character 'f', which is not changed because it has already been replaced with the next character in the alphabet.

In Test Case, the input string contains nine occurrences of the character 'b', which are replaced with the next character in the alphabet ('c'). Since there are still nine occurrences of the original character left after replacing the first nine, they are all replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and so on. In the end, none of the original characters remain.
