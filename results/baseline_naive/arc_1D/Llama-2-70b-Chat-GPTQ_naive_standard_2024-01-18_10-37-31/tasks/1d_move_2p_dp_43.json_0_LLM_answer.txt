LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'b', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'b', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'b', 'a']

Explanation:
The given function takes an array of characters as input and returns an array with the same number of elements, where each element is either the first occurrence of a character in the input or the last occurrence of a character in the input. If there are multiple occurrences of the same character in the input, then all occurrences of that character should be replaced by their corresponding first/last occurrence.
For example, in the first input-output pair, the character 'i' appears 5 times in the input. In the output, it is replaced by its first occurrence 'i' 4 times and its last occurrence 'i' once. Similarly, the character 'a' appears 7 times in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'a' 6 times and its last occurrence 'a' once. The character 'b' appears only once in the input and is replaced by its last occurrence 'b'.
In the second input-output pair, the character 'e' appears 8 times in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'e' 7 times and its last occurrence 'e' once. The character 'a' appears twice in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'a' once and its last occurrence 'a' once.
In the third input-output pair, the character 'g' appears 9 times in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'g' 8 times and its last occurrence 'g' once. The character 'a' appears twice in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'a' once and its last occurrence 'a' once.
In the test case, the character 'c' appears 7 times in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'c' 6 times and its last occurrence 'c' once. The character 'a' appears 4 times in the input and is replaced by its first occurrence 'a' 3 times and its last occurrence 'a' once. The character 'b' appears only once in the input and is replaced by its last occurrence 'b'.
Note that the order of the characters in the output matters, and the output should contain all the distinct characters from the input in the correct order.
