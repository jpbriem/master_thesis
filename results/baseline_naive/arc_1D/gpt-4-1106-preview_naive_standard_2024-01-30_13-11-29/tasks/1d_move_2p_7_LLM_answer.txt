Example_1:
input: ['a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['e', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Sample Outputs:
The examples you've provided suggest that the desired output is a list where the most frequent element is moved to the front. However, if two elements have the same frequency, the one that appears first in the input list should be placed at the front in the output list. If the most frequent element is already at the front, then the next most frequent element should be moved to the front, but placed after instances of the first element.

Based on the provided examples, let's create an algorithm to achieve this:

1. Count the frequency of each element in the input list.
2. Determine the most frequent element.
3. Move the most frequent element to the front of the list, but keep the order of the rest of the list the same.
4. If there's a tie, the element that comes first in the original list should come first in the output list.

Note that Example_3 doesn't seem to follow the same rule as the first two examples, as it moves the second most frequent element to the front, possibly because the most frequent element ('a') is already at the front.

Now let's apply this logic to the test case:

input: ['e', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

First, count the frequency:
- 'e': 3 times
- 'a': 4 times

'a' is the most frequent element, so it should be moved to the front. However, 'a' is already the first element, so look to the second most frequent ('e') and place it after the 'a's but before any other elements:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'a']

If the logic were to strictly move the most frequent element to the front regardless of its initial position, then the 'a's would stay at the front and the 'e's would follow, as in the original list:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e']

However, based on Example_3, it seems the intent is to move the second most frequent to the front when the most frequent is already at the front:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'a']
