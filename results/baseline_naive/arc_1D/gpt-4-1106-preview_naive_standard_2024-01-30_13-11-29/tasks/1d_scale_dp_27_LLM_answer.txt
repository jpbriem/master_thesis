Example_1:
input: ['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a']
output: ['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'i', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i']
output: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'i']

Example_3:
input: ['c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a']
output: ['c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'i', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'a']

Sample Outputs:
Based on the examples provided, the pattern suggests that the output is generated by replacing a contiguous sequence of 'a's that is immediately preceded by a sequence of another character with that preceding character, except for 'i's, which are left as is.

Here is how the pattern works:

1. Find the longest contiguous sequence of 'a's that is immediately preceded by a sequence of another character (not 'i').
2. Replace all 'a's in that sequence with the preceding character (except if the preceding character is 'i').
3. If 'i' is encountered, it remains unchanged.

Let's apply this pattern to the provided test case:

input: ['a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'a']

Starting from the left:
- The first 'a' is not preceded by another character, so it remains unchanged.
- Then we have a sequence of 'h's followed by 'a's. According to the pattern, we replace the 'a's with 'h's.
- The 'i' remains unchanged.
- The 'a's following the 'i' are not immediately preceded by a different character (since 'i' does not trigger a replacement), so they remain unchanged.

Applying the pattern to the test case, we get:

output: ['a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'i', 'a', 'a']
