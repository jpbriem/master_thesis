Example_1:
input: ['a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f']
output: ['a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'f']

Example_2:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'a']
output: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'f', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'f', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a']

Sample Outputs:
To generate the output based on the examples provided, it seems that we need to perform the following transformation on the input list:

- If there are 5 consecutive occurrences of a character followed by a different character, and then later in the list the first character occurs again consecutively, we should move the second set of consecutive occurrences to immediately follow the first set, keeping the rest of the list order the same.

Let's apply this logic to the test case provided:

input: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a']

1. We detect 5 consecutive 'd's.
2. We then see 'a' occurs later in the list after 'f'.
3. We move the 'a's to immediately follow the 'd's and maintain the order of the rest of the list.

output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a']

However, based on the examples given, it seems we should be doing the following instead:

- If there are 5 consecutive occurrences of a character, and then later in the list the first character occurs again consecutively, we should increase the first set of consecutive occurrences to match the total count of that character in the list.

Using this interpretation, here's what we should do:

1. Count the total occurrences of 'd' (5) and 'a' (5).
2. Since 'd' occurs 5 times in a row, and there are no more 'd's, we leave it as is.
3. For 'a', we have two sets of consecutive 'a's: ['a', 'a'] and ['a', 'a', 'f', 'a']. We need to increase the first set of consecutive 'a's to match the total count of 'a's in the list, which is 5.

output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f']

Please note that this is an interpretation of the pattern from the examples given, as there is no explicit rule provided for the transformation. If there are specific rules for the transformation you are looking for, please provide them for a more accurate answer.
