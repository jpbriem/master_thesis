LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'h', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'f', 'a', 'a']

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of two parts:

Part 1: Replace each occurrence of a letter with its next letter in the alphabet (clockwise). For example, "a" becomes "b", "b" becomes "c", and so on.

Part 2: If the resulting letter is already present in the sequence, repeat it. Otherwise, add it to the end of the sequence.

For example, in the first input sequence, "a" becomes "b", then "b" becomes "c", and so on. Since "c" is already present in the sequence, we repeat it. Similarly, in the second input sequence, "a" becomes "b", then "b" becomes "c", and so on. Since "c" is not present in the sequence, we add it to the end. In the third input sequence, "a" becomes "b", then "b" becomes "c", and so on. Since "c" is already present in the sequence, we repeat it. Finally, in the fourth input sequence, "a" becomes "b", then "b" becomes "c", and so on. Since "c" is not present in the sequence, we add it to the end.

Solution:
['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'f', 'a']
