LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'i', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'i', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a']
output: ['g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'i', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
