LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0]

Test case:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
