The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        # Note that this solution assumes that all nodes in the tree have unique values.
        # This assumption may not hold true in general.
        # For example, consider the following tree:
        #        4
        #       / \
        #     2    6

        # [ [4], [2, 1, 3], [6, 5, 7] ]

        # [ [4], [2, 1, 3], [6, 5, 7], [2, 1, 3], [6, 5, 7] ]
        # because it does not take into account the fact that some nodes may have the same value as their ancestors.
        # To address this issue, we can modify the algorithm to keep track of the previously seen values and only add new values to the list when they are different from what has been seen before.
        # Another approach would be to use a dictionary to store the mapping between each value and its corresponding subtree.
        # This way, we can avoid adding duplicate values to the list by checking whether a given value already exists in the dictionary.
        # Finally, it's worth noting that this problem can also be solved using dynamic programming techniques.
        # By maintaining a table of partial solutions, we can efficiently compute the final answer without having to traverse the entire tree multiple times.
        # Overall, there are many possible approaches to solving this problem depending on the specific requirements and constraints involved.
