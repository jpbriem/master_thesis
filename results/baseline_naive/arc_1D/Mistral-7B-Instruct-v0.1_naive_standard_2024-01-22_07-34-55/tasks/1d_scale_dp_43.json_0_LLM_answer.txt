LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes an integer as input and returns an integer as output. In this problem, we assume that the transformation function is unknown and needs to be learned from the given input-output pairs. We also assume that the input sequence always contains at least one zero element.

We can represent the transformation function using a neural network with one hidden layer. The input layer has one neuron for each element in the input sequence, and the output layer has one neuron. The hidden layer has two neurons. The activation functions used in the neurons are ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and sigmoid. The loss function used is mean squared error.

To train the neural network, we use stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We randomly select a batch of input-output pairs from the training set and compute the gradients of the weights and biases using backpropagation. We then update the weights and biases using the computed gradients and momentum. We repeat this process until convergence or a maximum number of epochs is reached.

Once the neural network is trained, it can be used to predict the output for any new input sequence.
