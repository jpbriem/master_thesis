LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a sequence of integers that represents the sum of all elements in the input array whose value is greater than or equal to 1. In Example_1, the output is [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means that the sum of all elements in the input array whose value is greater than or equal to 1 is 56. Similarly, in Example_2, the output is [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means that the sum of all elements in the input array whose value is greater than or equal to 1 is 72. In Example_3, the output is [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means that the sum of all elements in the input array whose value is greater than or equal to 1 is 64. Finally, in Test case, the output is [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means that the sum of all elements in the input array whose value is greater than or equal to 1 is 24.

Solution:
[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
