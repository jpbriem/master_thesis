LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a sequence of integers that represents the result of applying the given transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts: first, it replaces all occurrences of 0 with 1; second, it replaces all occurrences of 7 with 9.

Note that in Example_1, there are three elements equal to 0, so they will be replaced by 1s. Similarly, in Example_2, there are four elements equal to 7, so they will be replaced by 9s. In Example_3, there are two elements equal to 0, so they will be replaced by 1s. Finally, in Test case, there are three elements equal to 0, so they will be replaced by 1s, and one element equal to 7, so it will be replaced by 9.

Solution:
[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
