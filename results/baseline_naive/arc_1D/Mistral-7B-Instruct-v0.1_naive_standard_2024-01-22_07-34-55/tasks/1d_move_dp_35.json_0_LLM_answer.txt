LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input sequence. In particular, we can see that the first element in the output sequence is always the last element in the input sequence, and the second element in the output sequence is always the second last element in the input sequence, and so on. This means that the permutation applied to the input sequence is simply a cyclic shift of the elements in the input sequence.

We will use this observation to design an algorithm for finding all possible permutations of a given sequence. We will represent a permutation as a list of integers, where each integer represents the position of an element in the original sequence. For example, if the original sequence is [a, b, c], then the permutation [2, 0, 1] corresponds to the sequence [c, a, b].

To find all possible permutations of a given sequence, we can generate all possible lists of integers from 0 to n-1 (where n is the length of the original sequence), and check which ones correspond to valid permutations. A permutation is valid if it satisfies the condition that the sum of its elements is equal to the sum of the elements in the original sequence.

Here's the pseudocode for our algorithm:
```python
function permute(seq):
    n = len(seq)
    result = []
    for i in range(n!):
        # Generate a random permutation
        p = [i % n for i in range(n)]
        
        # Check if the permutation is valid
        total = sum(p)
        if total == sum(seq):
            result.append(p)
    
    return result
```
In this pseudocode, `n!` denotes the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. The loop generates all possible permutations of the integers from 0 to n-1 using the formula `[i % n for i in range(n)]`. The `total` variable stores the sum of the permutation, and the `if` statement checks if the sum is equal to the sum of the original sequence. If it is, the permutation is added to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all possible permutations of the original sequence.
