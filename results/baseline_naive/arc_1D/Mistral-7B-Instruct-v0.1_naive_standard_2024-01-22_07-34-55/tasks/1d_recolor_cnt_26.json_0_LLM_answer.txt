LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns another integer array. The transformation function can be expressed in terms of two operations: (i) adding a constant value to all elements of the input array; and (ii) replacing some elements with their negation. The specific values of these constants depend on the input sequence. In Example_1, for instance, the transformation function adds 2 to all elements except the last three, which are replaced with their negations. In Example_2, the transformation function adds 3 to all elements except the first two, which are replaced with their negations. In Example_3, the transformation function adds 4 to all elements except the last two, which are replaced with their negations.

We will use this information to design our algorithm. We will start by defining a function that takes as input an integer array and returns its length. Then we will define a function that takes as input an integer array and returns a new integer array where all elements are equal to the average of the original array. Next, we will define a function that takes as input an integer array and returns a new integer array where all elements are equal to the median of the original array. Finally, we will define the main function that takes as input an integer array and applies the above functions sequentially to obtain the final output.

### 5.1. Length Function

The length of an integer array can be easily computed using the built-in Python function `len()`. Therefore, we do not need to implement it ourselves.

### 5.2. Average Function

To compute the average of an integer array, we simply sum up all elements and divide by the number of elements. This operation can be implemented efficiently using the built-in Python function `sum()` and the variable `len()`.

### 5.3. Median Function

Computing the median of an integer array requires sorting the array in ascending order and then selecting the middle element(s). If there are an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Otherwise, the median is the middle element. This operation can be implemented efficiently using the built-in Python function `sorted()` and the variable `len()`.

### 5.4. Main Function

The main function takes as input an integer array and applies the above functions sequentially to obtain the final output. First, it computes the length of the array using the built-in Python function `len()`. Then it computes the average of the array using the `average()` function defined earlier. Next, it computes the median of the array using the `median()` function defined earlier. Finally, it combines the average and median into a single output array using the transformation function described in Section 5.

## 6. Implementation

Here is the implementation of the proposed algorithm in Python:
```python
def length(arr):
    return len(arr)

def average(arr):
    return sum(arr) / len(arr)

def median(arr):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    n = len(sorted_arr)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (sorted_arr[n//2 - 1] + sorted_arr[n//2]) / 2
    else:
        return sorted_arr[n//2]

def transform(arr):
    avg = average(arr)
    med = median(arr)
    transformed = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < avg:
            transformed.append(-avg + arr[i])
        elif arr[i] > avg:
            transformed.append(avg - arr[i])
        else:
            transformed.append(avg)
    return transformed

def process(arr):
    print("Length:", length(arr))
    print("Average:", average(arr))
    print("Median:", median(arr))
    print("Transformed:", transform(arr))
