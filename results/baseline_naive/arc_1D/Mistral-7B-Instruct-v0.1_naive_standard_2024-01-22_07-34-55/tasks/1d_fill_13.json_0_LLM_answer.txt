LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a sequence of integers where the first element is the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last one (which is always 0). The second element is the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last two elements (which are always 0). The third element is the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last three elements (which are always 0). And so on until the last element which is the sum of all elements in the input array.

For example, in Example_1, the first element is 7 because the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last one (which is 0) is 7. The second element is also 7 because the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last two elements (which are 0 and 0) is 7. The third element is 7 as well because the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last three elements (which are 0, 0 and 0) is 7. Finally, the fourth element is 7 because the sum of all elements in the input array is 7.

Similarly, in Test case, the first element is 7 because the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last one (which is 0) is 7. The second element is also 7 because the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last two elements (which are 0 and 0) is 7. The third element is 7 as well because the sum of all elements in the input array except for the last three elements (which are 0, 0 and 0) is 7. Finally, the fourth element is 7 because the sum of all elements in the input array is 7.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
