LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a list with two elements: the first element is the number of non-zero elements in the input list, and the second element is the transformed list.

### 4.2.2. Transformation Patterns

We can observe that the transformation patterns for all three examples are similar. In Example_1, we remove all zeros from the input list except the last one. In Example_2, we remove all zeros except the last one. In Example_3, we remove all zeros except the first one. This suggests that there may be a common transformation pattern that applies to all three cases. We can represent this pattern as follows:

Let l = length(input). Let i = index of last zero (or 1 if no zeros exist). Then, the transformed list is obtained by removing all zeros except the ones at indices i and 1âˆ’i.

This pattern can be applied recursively to sublists of the input list until all zeros have been removed. For example, consider the input list [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. Applying the above pattern to this list gives us [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. Applying the pattern again to this new list gives us [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. Finally, applying the pattern to this last list gives us [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0].

Note that the pattern works correctly even when the input list contains negative numbers or fractions. For example, consider the input list [0.5, -0.2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. Applying the pattern to this list gives us [0.5, -0.2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. Applying the pattern again to this new list gives us [0.5, -0.2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. Finally, applying the pattern to this last list gives us [0.5, -0.2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Solution:
[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
