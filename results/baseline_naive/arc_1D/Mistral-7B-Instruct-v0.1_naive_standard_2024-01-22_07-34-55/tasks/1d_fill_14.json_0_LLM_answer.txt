LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a simple linear transformation to the input sequence. Specifically, for each element in the input sequence, we add 6 if it is not equal to 0, otherwise we leave it unchanged. In other words, the output sequence consists of all elements that have value greater than or equal to 6, and all elements that have value less than 6 are replaced with 0.

We can represent this transformation using a simple loop that iterates over the input sequence and replaces any element that has value less than 6 with 0. We can then return the resulting sequence as the output. Here's an implementation of this algorithm in Python:
```python
def transform(input_seq):
    output_seq = []
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        if input_seq[i] >= 6:
            output_seq.append(input_seq[i])
        else:
            output_seq.append(0)
    return output_seq
```
This function takes an input sequence as its argument and returns the transformed sequence as its output. It first initializes an empty list called `output_seq`, which will store the transformed elements. Then it loops through each element in the input sequence using a `for` loop. For each element, it checks whether it is greater than or equal to 6 using an `if` statement. If it is, it appends the element to the `output_seq`. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the `output_seq`. Finally, it returns the `output_seq` as the transformed sequence.

Solution:
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
