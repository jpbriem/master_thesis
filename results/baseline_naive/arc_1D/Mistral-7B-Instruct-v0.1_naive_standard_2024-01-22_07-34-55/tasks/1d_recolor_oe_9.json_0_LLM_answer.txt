LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that all elements in the input array appear exactly once in the output array. In addition, the sum of all elements in the input array is equal to the sum of all elements in the output array.

For Example_1, the input array has a total of 14 elements with values ranging from 0 to 9. The output array also has a total of 14 elements with values ranging from 0 to 7. We can see that the first element in the input array (0) appears twice in the output array (once at position 0 and once at position 6). Similarly, the second element in the input array (0) appears twice in the output array (once at position 1 and once at position 5). All other elements in the input array appear only once in the output array.

We can use this observation to generate the output array for any given input array. Specifically, we can create an empty list and then iterate over the input array. For each element in the input array, we can check if it appears more than once in the input array. If it does not appear more than once, we can simply append it to the output list. Otherwise, we can find the index of the last occurrence of that element in the input array and swap it with the current index of the element in the output list. We repeat this process until all elements in the input array have been processed.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
```python
def permute(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    output = []
    visited = set()
    
    def dfs(i):
        nonlocal visited
        
        if i == n:
            # Check if all elements in the input array have been processed
            if set(visited) == set(range(n)):
                # Append the current permutation to the output list
                output.append(list(visited))
                return
            
        # Mark the current element as visited
        visited.add(arr[i])
        
        # Recursively call dfs on the remaining unprocessed elements
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            dfs(j)
        
        # Unmark the current element as visited
        visited.remove(arr[i])
    
    # Call dfs on the first element in the input array
    dfs(0)
    
    return output
```
This function takes an input array `arr` and returns a list of all possible permutations of the elements in `arr`. It uses recursion to explore all possible permutations. At each step, it checks if the current element has already been processed by checking if its value is in the `visited` set. If it has not been processed, it appends it to the output list. If it has been processed, it swaps it with the current index of the element in the output list and continues exploring the remaining unprocessed elements. Once all elements have been processed, it backtracks to the previous level of the recursion stack and continues exploring the remaining unprocessed elements. This process repeats until all possible permutations have been explored.
