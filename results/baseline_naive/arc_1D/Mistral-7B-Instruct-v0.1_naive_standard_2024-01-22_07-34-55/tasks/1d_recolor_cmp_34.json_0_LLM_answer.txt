LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer n and returns an integer m such that m = 4n + 2. In other words, it adds 2 to every multiple of 4 in the input sequence. For example, if the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], then the output sequence will be [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8]. This can be achieved by iterating over the input sequence and adding 2 to every multiple of 4.

Your task is to implement this transformation function in Python. You may assume that the input sequence will always contain at least one element.
