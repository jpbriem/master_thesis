LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation function takes the form of a linear combination of two functions: f(x) = x + k and g(x) = -x + l. The values of k and l depend on the specific example. For example, in Example_1, k = 0 and l = 0, while in Example_2, k = 0 and l = 1.

To solve the problem, we need to find the values of k and l that satisfy the given conditions for all possible inputs. We can do this using a brute force approach or an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent. Once we have found the optimal values of k and l, we can apply the transformation function to any input sequence to obtain the corresponding output sequence.
