LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array that satisfies the given conditions. In Example_1, the output is obtained by swapping the first two elements with the last element, then swapping the second and third elements with the fourth element, and finally swapping the fifth and sixth elements with the seventh element. In Example_2, the output is obtained by swapping the first two elements with the last element, then swapping the second and third elements with the fourth element, and finally swapping the fifth and sixth elements with the seventh element. In Example_3, the output is obtained by swapping the first two elements with the last element, then swapping the second and third elements with the fourth element, and finally swapping the fifth and sixth elements with the seventh element. In Test case, the output is obtained by swapping the first two elements with the last element, then swapping the second and third elements with the fourth element, and finally swapping the fifth and sixth elements with the seventh element.

Solution:
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
