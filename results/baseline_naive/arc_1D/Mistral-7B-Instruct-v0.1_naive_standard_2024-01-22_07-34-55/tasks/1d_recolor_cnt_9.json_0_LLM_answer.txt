LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a linear transformation to the input vector. Specifically, for each element in the input vector, we first check if it is equal to 3. If it is, we add 1 to it; otherwise, we leave it unchanged. Then, we multiply all elements in the resulting vector by 2. Finally, we subtract 1 from all elements in the resulting vector.

For Example_1, the input vector contains two 3s, so we add 1 to both of them and obtain [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]. We then multiply all elements in this vector by 2, obtaining [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 16, 16, 16, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0]. Finally, we subtract 1 from all elements in this vector, obtaining [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 15, 15, 15, 0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0], which is the output of Example_1.

Similarly, for Example_2, the input vector contains one 3, so we add 1 to it and obtain [0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0]. We then multiply all elements in this vector by 2, obtaining [0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0]. Finally, we subtract 1 from all elements in this vector, obtaining [0, 0, 5, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0], which is the output of Example_2.

Finally, for Example_3, the input vector contains two 3s, but they are not adjacent to each other. So we add 1 to neither of them and obtain [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]. We then multiply all elements in this vector by 2, obtaining [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]. Finally, we subtract 1 from all elements in this vector, obtaining [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], which is the output of Example_3.

Note that in all three examples, the output vector has the same length as the input vector and consists only of integers between 0 and 7 (inclusive). Also note that the transformation pattern used in these examples can be easily generalized to handle arbitrary input vectors with any number of elements.
