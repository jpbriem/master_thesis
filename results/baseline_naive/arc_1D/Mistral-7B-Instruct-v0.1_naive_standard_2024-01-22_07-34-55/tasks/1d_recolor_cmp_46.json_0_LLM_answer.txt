LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input a sequence of integers and returns a new sequence of integers with the same length. In this case, the transformation function maps each integer in the input sequence to its value plus one if it is not zero, or to itself otherwise. This can be expressed mathematically as follows:

f(x) = { x + 1 if x!= 0 else x } for all x in x

where f(x) denotes the transformed value of x.

Your task is to implement the above transformation function in Python. You may assume that the input sequence will always contain at least one nonzero element.

Solution:
[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7]
