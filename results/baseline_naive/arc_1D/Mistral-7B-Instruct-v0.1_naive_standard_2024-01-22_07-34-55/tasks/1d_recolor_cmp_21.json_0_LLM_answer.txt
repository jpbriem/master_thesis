LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation function takes the form of a linear combination of two functions: f(x) = x + k and g(x) = -k*x. The coefficients k and -k are determined by the values in the input sequence. Specifically, if there exists an element in the input sequence that is greater than or equal to 9, then k = 1; otherwise, k = 0. If there exists an element in the input sequence that is less than or equal to 1, then -k = 1; otherwise, -k = 0.

For Example_1, the first element (0) is less than or equal to 1, so -k = 0. The second element (8) is greater than or equal to 9, so k = 1. Therefore, the transformation function for this example is f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = -x. Applying these functions to the input sequence yields the output sequence [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8].

For Example_2, the first element (0) is less than or equal to 1, so -k = 0. The second element (8) is greater than or equal to 9, so k = 1. Therefore, the transformation function for this example is f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = -x. Applying these functions to the input sequence yields the output sequence [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0].

For Example_3, the first element (0) is less than or equal to 1, so -k = 0. The second element (8) is greater than or equal to 9, so k = 1. However, the third element (0) is also greater than or equal to 9, so k = 1 again. Therefore, the transformation function for this example is f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = -x. Applying these functions to the input sequence yields the output sequence [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

For Test case, the first element (0) is less than or equal to 1, so -k = 0. The second element (8) is greater than or equal to 9, so k = 1. The third element (8) is also greater than or equal to 9, so k = 1 again. However, the fourth element (8) is less than or equal to 1, so -k = 1. Therefore, the transformation function for this example is f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = -x. Applying these functions to the input sequence yields the output sequence [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0].
