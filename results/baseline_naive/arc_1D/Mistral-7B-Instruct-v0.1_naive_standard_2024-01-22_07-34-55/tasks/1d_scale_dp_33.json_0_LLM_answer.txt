LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) Repeat the first element in the input sequence until it reaches the length of the desired output sequence.
2) Append the last element of the input sequence to the repeated elements.

For example, for Example_1, the first part of the transformation results in [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], which is then appended with the last element (7) to obtain the final output [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0]. Similarly, for Example_2, the first part of the transformation results in [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], which is then appended with the last element (7) to obtain the final output [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]. For Example_3, the first part of the transformation results in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is then appended with the last element (7) to obtain the final output [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]. Finally, for Test case, the first part of the transformation results in [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], which is then appended with the last element (7) to obtain the final output [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0].
