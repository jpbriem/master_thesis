LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns another integer array. In this problem, we can assume that the length of the input sequence is always even.

For Example_1, the transformation function first removes all zeros from the input sequence. Then it replaces every occurrence of 7 with 4 in the resulting sequence. Finally, it removes all zeros again from the resulting sequence.

For Example_2, the transformation function first removes all zeros from the input sequence. Then it replaces every occurrence of 7 with 4 in the resulting sequence. Finally, it replaces every occurrence of 0 with 7 in the resulting sequence.

For Example_3, the transformation function is identical to that of Example_2 except that it replaces every occurrence of 0 with 4 instead of 7.

For Test case, the transformation function is identical to that of Example_2 except that it replaces every occurrence of 0 with 4 instead of 7.

Solution:
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0]
