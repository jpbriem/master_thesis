LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a simple linear transformation to the input sequence. Specifically, for each element in the input sequence, we first check if it is equal to zero. If it is, we replace it with its value plus one. Otherwise, we leave it unchanged. This transformation can be easily implemented using two nested loops that iterate over the input sequence and perform the necessary checks and replacements.

To solve the problem, we need to apply this transformation to the given input sequence until we obtain a sequence where all elements are either zero or one. We can then count the number of ones in this sequence to determine the answer.

Here's the Python code that implements this solution:
```python
def count_ones(input_sequence):
    # Apply the transformation to the input sequence until all elements are either zero or one
    while True:
        new_sequence = []
        for i in range(len(input_sequence)):
            if input_sequence[i] == 0:
                new_sequence.append(input_sequence[i] + 1)
            else:
                new_sequence.append(input_sequence[i])
        if new_sequence == input_sequence:
            break
        input_sequence = new_sequence
    
    # Count the number of ones in the final sequence
    return sum(1 for x in input_sequence if x == 1)
```
This function takes an integer array `input_sequence` as input and returns an integer representing the number of ones in the transformed sequence. It uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the transformation to the input sequence until it reaches a stable state where all elements are either zero or one. Once this state is reached, it counts the number of ones in the final sequence using a generator expression and returns the result.
