LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) Repeat the first element in the input sequence until it becomes equal to the second element.
2) Remove all elements from the resulting sequence except for the last one.

For example, in Example_1, the first element (0) is repeated until it becomes equal to the second element (2), which results in the sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]. Then, only the last element (9) remains in the final output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0].

Similarly, in Example_2, the first element (0) is repeated until it becomes equal to the second element (6), which results in the sequence [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]. Then, only the last element (9) remains in the final output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0].

In Example_3, the first element (0) is not repeated because it is already equal to the second element (0). Therefore, the resulting sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then, only the last element (9) remains in the final output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Finally, in Test case, the first element (3) is repeated until it becomes equal to the second element (3), which results in the sequence [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then, only the last element (9) remains in the final output sequence [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0].
