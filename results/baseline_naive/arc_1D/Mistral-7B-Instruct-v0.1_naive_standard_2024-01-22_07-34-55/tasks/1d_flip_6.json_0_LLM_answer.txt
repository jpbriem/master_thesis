LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input array such that the first element is placed at position 4 in the output array, the second element is placed at position 6, the third element is placed at position 1, the fourth element is placed at position 2, the fifth element is placed at position 5, the sixth element is placed at position 0, the seventh element is placed at position 3, and the eighth element is placed at position 8. The ninth element is always 0.

Note that the permutation used in Example_1 is different from the one used in Example_2. However, both permutations follow the same pattern as described above. Similarly, the permutation used in Example_3 is different from the one used in Test case, but they also follow the same pattern.

Your task is to write a function that takes an integer array as input and returns the corresponding output array according to the given pattern.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
