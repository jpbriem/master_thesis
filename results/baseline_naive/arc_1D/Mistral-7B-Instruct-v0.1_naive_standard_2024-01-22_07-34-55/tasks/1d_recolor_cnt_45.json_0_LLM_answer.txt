LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that the sum of all elements in the array is equal to 2*n (where n is the length of the input array). In other words, the output array has the property that for any element x in the output array, there exists an index i in the input array such that x + input[i] = 2*n.

For example, in Example_1, the output array is [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can see that for any element x in this output array, there exists an index i in the input array such that x + input[i] = 2*n. For example, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 8 = 8, 3 + 8 = 11, 3 + 0 = 3, 0 + 0 = 0, 2 + 0 = 2, 2 + 0 = 2, 2 + 8 = 10, 0 + 8 = 8, 7 + 0 = 7, 0 + 3 = 0, 3 + 0 = 3, 0 + 3 = 0, 0 + 3 = 0, 0 + 3 = 0, 7 + 0 = 7, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0. Therefore, the output array satisfies the given condition.

Similarly, we can verify that the output arrays of Examples_2 and Examples_3 also satisfy the given condition.

We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of distinct subarrays of the first i elements of the input array that have a sum of j. Then, the solution to the problem is given by max(dp[n-1][k]) where k ranges from 0 to 2*n.

To compute dp[i][j], we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: The current element is not included in the subarray. In this case, we can simply take the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i-1][j-input[i]]. This corresponds to excluding or including the current element in the subarray.

Case 2: The current element is included in the subarray. In this case, we need to exclude the current element from the subarray. We can do this by taking the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i-1][j-input[i]-1]. This corresponds to excluding the current element from the subarray while still considering it as part of the previous subarray.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
```python
def maxDistinctSubarrays(input):
    n = len(input)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(2 * n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Initialize the first row and column of dp table
    for i in range(n+1):
        dp[i][0] = 0
        
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
        
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, 2*n+1):
            if input[i-1] == j:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-input[i]])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-input[i]-1])
