LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input. In this case, the transformation is to remove all zeros from the input array and then add 9 at the end of the resulting array.

Note that in Example_1, there are two zeroes in the input array, but only one zero remains after removing them. This is because the second zero was removed before the first zero. Similarly, in Example_2, there are three zeroes in the input array, but only two remain after removing them. This is because the third zero was removed before the second zero.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]
