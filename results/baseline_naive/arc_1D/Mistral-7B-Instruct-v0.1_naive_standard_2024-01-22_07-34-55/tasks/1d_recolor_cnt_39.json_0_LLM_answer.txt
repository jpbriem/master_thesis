LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that all elements in the input array appear exactly once in the output array. In addition, the sum of all elements in the input array is equal to the sum of all elements in the output array.

For Example_1, we can see that the input array has two zeros and four fours. We first add up all the elements in the input array to get 28. Then we divide this by 2 to get 14 as the target sum for the output array. Since there are six elements in the input array, we need to choose three of them to form the output array. We can do this using combinations, which gives us C(6,3) = 20 possible ways to choose the elements. However, since the order does not matter, we only need to consider one element at a time and swap it with another element until we have formed an arrangement where all elements appear exactly once. This can be done using a simple algorithm that iterates through all possible permutations of the input array and checks if they satisfy the condition that all elements appear exactly once. If a permutation satisfies this condition, we return it; otherwise, we continue to the next permutation.

Similarly, for Example_2, we can see that the input array has eight elements with values ranging from zero to four. We first add up all the elements in the input array to get 28. Then we divide this by 2 to get 14 as the target sum for the output array. Since there are eight elements in the input array, we need to choose four of them to form the output array. We can do this using combinations, which gives us C(8,4) = 70 possible ways to choose the elements. However, since the order does not matter, we only need to consider one element at a time and swap it with another element until we have formed an arrangement where all elements appear exactly once. This can be done using a similar algorithm as before.

Finally, for Example_3, we can see that the input array has four elements with values ranging from zero to four. We first add up all the elements in the input array to get 16. Then we divide this by 2 to get 8 as the target sum for the output array. Since there are four elements in the input array, we need to choose two of them to form the output array. We can do this using combinations, which gives us C(4,2) = 6 possible ways to choose the elements. However, since the order does not matter, we only need to consider one element at a time and swap it with another element until we have formed an arrangement where all elements appear exactly once. This can also be done using a similar algorithm as before.

Overall, the key idea behind solving this problem is to use combinations to generate all possible arrangements of the input elements and then check if each arrangement satisfies the condition that all elements appear exactly once. This can be done efficiently using a simple algorithm that iterates through all possible permutations of the input array and swaps elements until the desired condition is satisfied.
