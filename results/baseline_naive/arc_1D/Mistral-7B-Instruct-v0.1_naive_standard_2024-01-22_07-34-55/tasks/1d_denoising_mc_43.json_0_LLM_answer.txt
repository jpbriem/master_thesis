LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Answer (1)

You can use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list and check if it is equal to 6. If it is, you can add it to a new list. Then you can return this new list.

Here's one way you could do that:

```
def filter_list(lst):
    filtered = []
    for num in lst:
        if num == 6:
            filtered.append(num)
    return filtered
```

You can call this function with your example inputs like so:

```
print(filter_list([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(filter_list([0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(filter_list([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(filter_list([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,
