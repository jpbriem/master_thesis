## Answer (1)

You can use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. You will need to keep track of the current sum and the previous sum as you move through the array. If the current sum is greater than or equal to the target sum, then you have found a solution.

Here's some sample code in Python that implements this algorithm:

```
def findSubsetSum(arr, target):
    n = len(arr)
    curr_sum = prev_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr_sum += arr[i]
        if curr_sum >= target:
            return True
        prev_sum = curr_sum
    return False
```

This function takes two arguments: `arr`, which is the input array, and `target`, which is the target sum. It returns `True` if there exists a subset of the array whose sum equals the target sum, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses two variables to keep track of the current sum and the previous sum as it moves through the array. It starts with both variables set to zero. Then, for each element in the array, it adds the element to the current sum and checks whether the current sum is greater than or equal to the target sum. If it is, then it has found a solution and returns `True`. Otherwise, it updates the previous sum to be the current sum and continues moving through the array.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
