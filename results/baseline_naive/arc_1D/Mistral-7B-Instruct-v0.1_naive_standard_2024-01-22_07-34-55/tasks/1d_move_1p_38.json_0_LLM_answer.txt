LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input. In this case, the transformation function takes an array as input and returns a new array with the same length but different values. Specifically, for each element in the input array, if its value is 0, then it remains unchanged in the output array; otherwise, it is replaced by the corresponding value in another array (which may be the same or different). This transformation can be implemented using two arrays, one containing the values that should remain unchanged and the other containing the values that should be replaced.

For example, in Example_1, the input array contains only zeros, so the output array will also contain only zeros. In Example_2, the input array contains some non-zero values, which are replaced by the corresponding values in the second array (which is all ones). In Example_3, the input array contains some non-zero values, which are replaced by the corresponding values in the second array (which is all threes). Finally, in Test case, the input array contains some non-zero values, which are replaced by the corresponding values in the second array (which is all sevens).
