LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a linear transformation to the input vector. In this case, the linear transformation can be represented as follows:

y[i] = x[i] + k*x[i+1] + b

where y[i] is the i-th element of the output vector, x[i] is the i-th element of the input vector, k is a constant that determines the slope of the line connecting two consecutive elements in the output vector, and b is a constant that determines the intercept of the line connecting the first element of the output vector with the x-axis.

In order to solve the problem, we need to find the values of k and b that satisfy the given conditions. We can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the sum of all elements in the input vector. Let's call it s.
2. Divide the sum of all elements in the output vector by s. This will give us the average value of the output vector. Let's call it m.
3. Subtract m from each element of the output vector. This will give us a new sequence of numbers where the sum of all elements is zero.
4. Multiply each element of the new sequence by its corresponding index (starting from 0). This will give us a new sequence of numbers where the sum of all elements is equal to the product of the indices and the differences between the original output vector and the new sequence.
5. Calculate the sum of all elements in the new sequence. Let's call it t.
6. Divide t by the product of the indices. This will give us the value of b.
7. Calculate the slope of the line connecting two consecutive elements in the output vector using the formula: k = (m - x[0]) / x[1].
8. If k is not an integer, round it to the nearest integer.
9. Return the values of k and b.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:
```python
def linear_transformation(input_vector):
    n = len(input_vector)
    s = sum(input_vector)
    m = sum(input_vector) / s
    
    output_vector = [x - m for x in input_vector]
    t = sum(output_vector)
    p = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, range(n))
    b = t / p
    
    k = (m - input_vector[0]) / input_vector[1]
    if k % 1!= 0:
        k = int(k)
        
    return k, b
```
We can test the function using the following code:
```python
test_cases = [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]]
for input_vector in test_cases:
    k, b = linear_transformation(input_vector)
    print("Input:", input_vector)
    print("Output:", [x + k*y + b for x, y in zip(input_vector, input_vector[1:])])
    print()
```
This should output:
```yaml
Input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2,
