LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In Example_1, the transformation is to remove all elements that have a value less than or equal to 2. In Example_2, the transformation is to replace all elements with their corresponding index in the input sequence. In Example_3, the transformation is to remove all elements that have a value greater than 0. In Test case, the transformation is to remove all elements that have a value greater than 3.

Note that the order of the elements in the output sequence may differ from the order of the elements in the input sequence due to the application of the transformation.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0]
