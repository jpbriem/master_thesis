LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array that satisfies the given condition. In this problem, we can assume that the input array will always contain at least one zero element.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
n == m
0 <= x[i] < n
x[i]!= 0

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n and m.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the input array x.

Output Format:
A single integer denoting the number of distinct elements in the permuted array.

Explanation:
For Example_1, we can see that there are three distinct elements in the input array (0, 3, 3). After applying the transformation, we get [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can see that all elements in the input array have been replaced with their corresponding values in the output array. Since there are still three distinct elements in the output array (0, 3, 3), the answer is 3.

Similarly, for Example_2, we can see that there are four distinct elements in the input array (0, 0, 2, 2). After applying the transformation, we get [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can see that all elements in the input array have been replaced with their corresponding values in the output array. Since there are still four distinct elements in the output array (0, 0, 2, 2), the answer is 4.

For Example_3, we can see that there are five distinct elements in the input array (0, 0, 9, 9, 9). After applying the transformation, we get [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can see that all elements in the input array have been replaced with their corresponding values in the output array. Since there are still five distinct elements in the output array (0, 0, 9, 9, 9), the answer is 5.

For Test case, we can see that there are six distinct elements in the input array (0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0). After applying the transformation, we get [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. We can see that all elements in the input array have been replaced with their corresponding values in the output array. Since there are still six distinct elements in the output array (0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0), the answer is 6.
