LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes an integer as input and returns an integer. In this problem, we assume that the transformation function is unknown and needs to be learned from the given input-output pairs. We also assume that the input sequence always contains at least one zero element.

We can represent the transformation function as a linear combination of the input elements. Specifically, let w = [w\_0, w\_1,..., w\_{n-1}] be a vector of weights, where n is the length of the input sequence. Then, for any input sequence x = [x\_0, x\_1,..., x\_{n-1}], the output y of the transformation function can be expressed as:
y = w\_0 \* x\_0 + w\_1 \* x\_1 +... + w\_{n-1} \* x\_{n-1}

Our goal is to find the optimal values of w such that the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs is minimized. To do this, we will use a simple gradient descent algorithm with stochastic updates.

At each iteration t, we randomly select a batch of k input-output pairs (xi, yi) from the training set and compute the predicted output y\_pred using the current values of w. We then calculate the error e\_t = y\_pred - yi and update the weights w using the formula:
w\_t+1 = w\_t - alpha \* e\_t / k
where alpha is the learning rate.

We repeat this process until convergence or until a maximum number of iterations is reached. At the end of the training process, we evaluate the performance of the model on a test set of input-output pairs and report the mean squared error (MSE).

Note that in practice, it may not be possible to find the exact optimal solution due to numerical instabilities or other issues. Therefore, we may need to use techniques such as regularization or early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
