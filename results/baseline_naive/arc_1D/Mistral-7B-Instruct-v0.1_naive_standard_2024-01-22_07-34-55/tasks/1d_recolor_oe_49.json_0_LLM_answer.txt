LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Answer (1)

You can use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. You will need to keep track of the sum of elements in the current window and also the sum of elements in the previous window. Whenever you encounter an element that is greater than or equal to the sum of the previous window, you add it to the output list.

Here's some sample code in Python:

```
def find_elements(arr):
    result = []
    curr_sum = 0
    prev_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] >= prev_sum:
            result.append(arr[i])
        curr_sum += arr[i]
        prev_sum = curr_sum - arr[i]
    return result
```

This should work for your test cases as well.
