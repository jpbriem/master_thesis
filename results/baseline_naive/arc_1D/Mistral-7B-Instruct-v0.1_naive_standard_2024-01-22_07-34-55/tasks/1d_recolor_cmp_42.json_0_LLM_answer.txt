LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns an integer array. The transformation function can be expressed in terms of two operations: (i) concatenation of two arrays and (ii) addition of two integers. In particular, for any input sequence x = [x[0], x[1],..., x[n]], the output sequence y = f(x) is defined as follows:
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = 0; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 1; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 2; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 3; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 4; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 5; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 6; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 7; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 8; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 9; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 10; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 11; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 12; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 13; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 14; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 15; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 16; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 17; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 18; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 19; or
y[i] = x[j] + x[k] for i = j = k = n - 20; or
