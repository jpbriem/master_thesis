LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input array such that all elements except for one element are in increasing order. In Example_1, the permutation is (4, 5), which means that the first four elements are swapped with the last two elements. In Example_2, the permutation is (1, 2), which means that the second element is swapped with the third element. In Example_3, the permutation is (7, 8), which means that the last element is swapped with the second element. In Test case, the permutation is (6, 7), which means that the second element is swapped with the third element.

Note that there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the condition in the problem statement. However, we only need to find one such permutation.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
