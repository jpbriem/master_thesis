LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation function takes the form of a sliding window with a fixed size of 4. For each position in the input sequence, the function selects the next four elements after that position and returns their sum. If there are less than 4 elements remaining in the sequence, the function returns 0 for the corresponding element in the output sequence.

For example, for the first input sequence in Example_1, the transformation function at position 0 selects the next four elements ([3, 3, 3, 3]) and returns their sum (12), which becomes the value of the first element in the output sequence (0). Similarly, for the second input sequence in Example_2, the transformation function at position 0 selects the next four elements ([3, 3, 0, 0]) and returns their sum (6), which becomes the value of the first element in the output sequence (3).

Note that the transformation function can be easily extended to handle different window sizes by changing the number of elements selected in each iteration.

Solution:
[0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
