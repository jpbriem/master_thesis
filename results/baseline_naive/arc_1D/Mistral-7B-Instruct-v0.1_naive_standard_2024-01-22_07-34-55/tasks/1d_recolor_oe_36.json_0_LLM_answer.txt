LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns an integer array with the same length. The transformation function can be expressed in terms of two operations: (i) adding a constant value to all elements of the input array; and (ii) replacing every element of the input array with its double. In Example_1, the transformation function adds 4 to all elements of the input array except for the last two elements which are replaced with their doubles. In Example_2, the transformation function replaces every element of the input array with its double except for the first two elements which are replaced with their doubles plus 4. In Example_3, the transformation function adds 4 to all elements of the input array except for the last two elements which are replaced with their doubles minus 4.

We will use this transformation pattern to solve the problem. We will define a function `transform` that takes as input an integer array and returns an integer array with the same length. The function will apply the transformation pattern described above to the input array. Then we will call the `transform` function on the input array and return the result.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
