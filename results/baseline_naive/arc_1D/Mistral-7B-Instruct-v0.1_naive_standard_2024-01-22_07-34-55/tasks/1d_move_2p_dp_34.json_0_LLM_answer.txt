LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input. The transformation function takes an array as input and returns a new array with the same length as the input array. In this case, the transformation function applies a permutation operation on the input array such that all elements in the array are moved to their corresponding positions in the output array based on some rule. The rule can be represented using a mapping function which maps each element in the input array to its corresponding position in the output array. For example, if the input array is [a, b, c], then the mapping function may map a to position 0, b to position 1, and c to position 2. Then the permutation operation will move all elements in the input array to their corresponding positions in the output array.

In Example_1, the mapping function maps all zeros to position 0, all ones to position 1, and all sixes to position 2. Therefore, the permutation operation moves all zeros to position 0, all ones to position 1, and all sixes to position 2 in the output array.

In Example_2, the mapping function maps all zeros to position 0, all twos to position 1, and all fours to position 2. Therefore, the permutation operation moves all zeros to position 0, all twos to position 1, and all fours to position 2 in the output array.

In Example_3, the mapping function maps all zeros to position 0, all eights to position 1, and all zeroes to position 2. Therefore, the permutation operation moves all zeros to position 0, all eights to position 1, and all zeroes to position 2 in the output array.

In Test case, the mapping function maps all zeros to position 0, all eights to position 1, and all zeroes to position 2. Therefore, the permutation operation moves all zeros to position 0, all eights to position 1, and all zeroes to position 2 in the output array.
