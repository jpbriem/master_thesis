LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a sequence of operations to the input array. In particular, for each element in the input array, if it is equal to 3, then we replace it with 0; otherwise, we leave it unchanged. Then, we remove all zeros from the resulting array. Finally, we insert an 8 at the end of the resulting array.

For Example_1, the initial input array is [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. After replacing all occurrences of 3 with 0, we obtain [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. Removing all zeros gives us [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Inserting an 8 at the end yields the final output [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8].

Similarly, for Example_2, the initial input array is [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Replacing all occurrences of 3 with 0 gives us [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. Removing all zeros results in [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Inserting an 8 at the end produces the final output [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8].

Finally, for Example_3, the initial input array is [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. Replacing all occurrences of 4 with 0 gives us [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. Removing all zeros results in [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Inserting an 8 at the end produces the final output [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8].

Note that the order of the elements in the output arrays may differ from the order of the elements in the input arrays due to the way the operations are applied. However, the overall structure of the output arrays will be the same as the desired output format specified in the problem statement.
