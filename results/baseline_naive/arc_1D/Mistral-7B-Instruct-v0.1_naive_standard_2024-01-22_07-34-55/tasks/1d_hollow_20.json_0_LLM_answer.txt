LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation function takes the form of a sliding window with a fixed size of 4. For each position in the input sequence, the function selects the next four elements after that position and returns their sum. If there are less than 4 elements remaining in the sequence, the function returns 0 for the corresponding element in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first element in the output sequence (0) corresponds to the sum of the next four elements in the input sequence starting from the second position (0+0+0+0=0). Similarly, the second element in the output sequence (0) corresponds to the sum of the next four elements starting from the third position (0+0+0+0=0), and so on.

In Example_2, the first two elements in the output sequence (0, 0) correspond to the sum of the next four elements starting from the second position (3+3+3+3=9) and the fourth position (3+3+3+3=9), respectively. The third element in the output sequence (3) corresponds to the sum of the next four elements starting from the fifth position (3+3+3+3=9).

In Example_3, all elements in the output sequence (5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) correspond to the sum of the next four elements starting from the second position (5+5+5+5=15), since there are only 8 elements in the input sequence.

In Test case, the first three elements in the output sequence (0, 0, 0) correspond to the sum of the next four elements starting from the second position (3+3+3+3=9), the fourth position (3+3+3+3=9), and the sixth position (3+3+3+3=9), respectively. The fourth element in the output sequence (3) corresponds to the sum of the next four elements starting from the seventh position (3+3+3+3=9).
