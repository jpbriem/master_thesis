The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns an integer array with the same length. In this problem, we assume that the transformation function is unknown and needs to be learned from the given examples. We also assume that the transformation function is monotonic increasing.

We can represent the transformation function using a piecewise linear function. Specifically, let f(x) = p\_1*x + b\_1 if x < c\_1, and f(x) = p\_2*x + b\_2 otherwise, where p\_1, p\_2, b\_1, and b\_2 are constants. Then, the output of the transformation function for input x is f(x). Since the transformation function is monotonic increasing, we have p\_1 < p\_2.

To learn the transformation function from the given examples, we need to find the values of p\_1, p\_2, b\_1, and b\_2 such that the output of the transformation function matches the expected output for each example. This can be done using a least squares optimization algorithm.

Once we have learned the transformation function, we can apply it to any new input sequence to obtain its transformed sequence. For example, if we want to transform the test case input [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], we first need to determine which part of the input sequence falls below c\_1 and which part falls above c\_1. Let's say that the first three elements fall below c\_1 and the remaining elements fall above c\_1. Then, we can apply the transformation function to the first three elements using p\_1 and b\_1, and to the remaining elements using p\_2 and b\_2. The resulting transformed sequence is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0].
