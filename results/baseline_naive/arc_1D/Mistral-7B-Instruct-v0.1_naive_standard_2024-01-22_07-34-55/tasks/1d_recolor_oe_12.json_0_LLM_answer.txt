LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

The output of each example is a sequence of integers that represents the result of applying the given transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation is a combination of two operations: shifting and adding. Specifically, for each element in the input sequence, if it is not zero, we shift it one position to the right (i.e., add 1) and then add 1 again. If it is zero, we leave it as is.

For example, in Example_1, the first non-zero element is 4, so we shift it one position to the right (i.e., add 1), which gives us 5. Then we add 1 again, which gives us 6. We repeat this process for all elements in the input sequence until we reach the end.

Similarly, in Example_2, the first non-zero element is also 4, but since it is followed by another non-zero element (which is 4), we do not shift it. Instead, we simply add 1 to get 5. We repeat this process for all elements in the input sequence until we reach the end.

In Test case, the input sequence has an additional non-zero element at the beginning (which is 0). Since this element is not zero, we shift it one position to the right (i.e., add 1) to get 1. We then add 1 again to get 2. We repeat this process for all elements in the input sequence until we reach the end.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]
