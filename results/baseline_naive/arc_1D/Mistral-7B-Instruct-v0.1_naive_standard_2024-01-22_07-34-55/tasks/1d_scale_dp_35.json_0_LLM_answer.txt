LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2]

LLM answer:

output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input array. In particular, we can see that in Example_1, the first two elements are swapped, while in Example_2, the last three elements are swapped. In Example_3, the second element is replaced with 1, and in Test case, all elements except for the last one are repeated twice.

We will use this observation to design an algorithm that takes as input an array of integers and outputs its permutations. We will represent a permutation as a list of tuples (i, j), where i and j are indices of the original array. For example, the permutation [(0, 1), (1, 2)] corresponds to the array [1, 2, 0].

Our algorithm will be based on recursion. Given an input array A and a current permutation P, we will generate all possible permutations of the remaining elements of A by recursively calling our function with the subarray B = A[P+1:], where P+1 denotes the index after P in the original array. Then, we will add each generated permutation to the set of all permutations of A.

Here's the pseudocode of our algorithm:
```python
function permute(A, P):
    if len(A) == 1:
        yield (P,)
    else:
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if i not in P:
                B = A[:i] + A[i+1:]
                for Q in permute(B, P | {i}):
                    yield (Q,)
```
Note that we use sets to keep track of the indices used in each permutation. This allows us to avoid duplicates and ensures that each permutation is unique.

To test our algorithm, we can call it with an input array A and print out all the generated permutations. Here's some sample Python code that implements our algorithm and tests it with the arrays from Examples_1 to Test case:
```python
def permute(A, P=None):
    if P is None:
        P = set()
    if len(A) == 1:
        yield (P,)
    else:
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if i not in P:
                B = A[:i] + A[i+1:]
                for Q in permute(B, P | {i}):
                    yield (Q,)

for A in [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2],
          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2]]:
    print("Input:", A)
    print("Permutations:")
    for Q in permute(A):
        print("\t", Q)
```
This should output the following permutations for each input array:
```yaml
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2]
	Permutations:

Solution:
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]
