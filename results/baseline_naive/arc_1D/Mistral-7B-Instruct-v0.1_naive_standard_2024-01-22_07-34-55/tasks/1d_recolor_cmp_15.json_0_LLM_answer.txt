LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer n and returns an integer m such that m = 4n + k, where k is a constant value. In this case, k = 0.

For Example_1, the transformation function maps the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0] to the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]. This can be achieved by setting k = 0 in the formula m = 4n + k and then applying the formula m = 4n + k to each element of the input sequence. For example, for the first element (0), we have m = 4(0) + 0 = 0, so the output is also 0. Similarly, for the second element (0), we have m = 4(0) + 0 = 0, so the output is also 0. For the third element (0), we have m = 4(0) + 0 = 0, so the output is also 0. For the fourth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the fifth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the sixth element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the seventh element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the eighth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the ninth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the tenth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the eleventh element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the twelfth element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the thirteenth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the fourteenth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the fifteenth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the sixteenth element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the seventeenth element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the eighteenth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the nineteenth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the twentieth element (4), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the twenty-first element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the twenty-second element (0), we have m = 4(1) + 0 = 4, so the output is 4. For the twenty-third element (4), we have m = 4(1) +
