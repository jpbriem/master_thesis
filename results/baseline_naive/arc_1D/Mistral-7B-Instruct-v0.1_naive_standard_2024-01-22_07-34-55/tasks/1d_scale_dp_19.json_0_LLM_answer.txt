LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) Repeat the first element in the input sequence until it appears at least once in the input sequence.
2) Remove all occurrences of the last element in the input sequence.

For example, for Example_1, the first part of the transformation results in [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], which has the first element repeated twice. Then, removing the last element (0) results in the final output [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0]. Similarly, for Example_2, the first part of the transformation results in [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0], which has the first element repeated five times. Then, removing the last element (0) results in the final output [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]. For Example_3, the first part of the transformation results in [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], which has the first element repeated four times. Then, removing the last element (0) results in the final output [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]. Finally, for Test case, the first part of the transformation results in [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], which has the first element repeated six times. Then, removing the last element (0) results in the final output [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9].
