LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that all elements except one are in increasing order. In Example_1, the element at index 9 (which is 0) is not in increasing order with its neighbors, so it is swapped with the last element (which is also 0). In Example_2, the element at index 6 (which is 3) is not in increasing order with its neighbors, so it is swapped with the second to last element (which is also 3). In Example_3, the element at index 8 (which is 0) is not in increasing order with its neighbors, so it is swapped with the third to last element (which is also 0). In Test case, the element at index 7 (which is 5) is not in increasing order with its neighbors, so it is swapped with the fourth to last element (which is also 5).

Note that there may be multiple solutions for some inputs, but any solution will have the desired property.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]
