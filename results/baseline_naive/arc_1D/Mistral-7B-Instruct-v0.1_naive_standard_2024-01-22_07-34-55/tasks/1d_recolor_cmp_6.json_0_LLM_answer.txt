LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a linear transformation to the input vector. Specifically, for each element in the input vector, we first check if it is equal to zero. If it is, then we set its corresponding output element to be equal to the sum of all other elements in the input vector. Otherwise, we set its corresponding output element to be equal to half of the absolute value of the difference between the current element and the maximum element in the input vector.

We can see that this transformation preserves the order of the input vector and also ensures that the output vector has the same number of elements as the input vector. Moreover, since the transformation only involves basic arithmetic operations, it can be easily implemented using standard programming constructs.

Solution:
[0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
