LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a linear transformation to the input vector. In this case, the linear transformation can be represented as follows:

y[i] = x[i] * w + b

where y[i] is the i-th element of the output vector, x[i] is the i-th element of the input vector, w is a weight vector, and b is a bias term.

Note that in all three examples, the weight vector w is the same for all elements of the input vector. This means that the linear transformation applied to each element of the input vector is the same. Therefore, we only need to compute the bias term b once for the entire input vector.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the value of the bias term b. We can do this by computing the mean of the input vector and subtracting it from the mean of the output vector. Let's denote these means by m\_x and m\_y respectively. Then, we have:

b = (m\_y - m\_x) / n

where n is the length of the input vector.

Once we have computed the value of the bias term b, we can use it to compute the output vector for any given input vector using the formula above.
