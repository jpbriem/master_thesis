LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array that satisfies the given condition. In Example_1, the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. This permutation has the property that all elements in the first half of the array (i.e., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) are equal to 0, while all elements in the second half of the array (i.e., [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) are equal to 3. Similarly, in Example_2, the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has the property that all elements in the first half of the array (i.e., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) are equal to 0, while all elements in the second half of the array (i.e., [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) are equal to 2. Finally, in Example_3, the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has the property that all elements in the first half of the array (i.e., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) are equal to 0, while all elements in the second half of the array (i.e., [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]) are equal to 5.

Note that the order of the elements in the output array does not matter as long as they satisfy the given condition. For example, in Example_1, the output could be any permutation of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] that satisfies the condition.
