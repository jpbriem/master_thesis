LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns an integer array with the same length. In this problem, we assume that the transformation function is unknown and needs to be learned from the given examples. We also assume that the transformation function is monotonic, i.e., if $a < b$ in the input sequence, then $f(a) < f(b)$ in the output sequence.

We can represent the transformation function as a permutation $\pi : \{1, \ldots, n\} \rightarrow \{1, \ldots, n\}$ where $n$ is the length of the input sequence. Since the transformation function is monotonic, it must satisfy the property that $\pi (i) > \pi (j)$ if and only if $i > j$. Therefore, we can represent the transformation function using a binary vector of length $n$, where the $i$-th element is equal to 1 if and only if $\pi (i) > \pi (j)$ for all $j < i$. We denote this binary vector by $\mathbf{p}$.

For example, consider the input sequence $[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]$ and the corresponding output sequence $[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]$. If we apply the transformation function to the input sequence, we obtain the output sequence $[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]$. This means that $\pi (1) = 1$, $\pi (2) = 2$, $\pi (3) = 4$, $\pi (4) = 5$, $\pi (5) = 6$, $\pi (6) = 7$, $\pi (7) = 8$, $\pi (8) = 9$, $\pi (9) = 10$, $\pi (10) = 11$, $\pi (11) = 12$, $\pi (12) = 13$, $\pi (13) = 14$, $\pi (14) = 15$, $\pi (15) = 16$, $\pi (16) = 17$, $\pi (17) = 18$, $\pi (18) = 19$, $\pi (19) = 20$, $\pi (20) = 21$, $\pi (21) = 22$, $\pi (22) = 23$, $\pi (23) = 24$, $\pi (24) = 25$, $\pi (25) = 26$, $\pi (26) = 27$, $\pi (27) = 28$, $\pi (28) = 29$, $\pi (29) = 30$, $\pi (30) = 31$, $\pi (31) = 32$, $\pi (32) = 33$, $\pi (33) = 34$, $\pi (34) = 35$, $\pi (35) = 36$, $\pi (36) = 37$, $\pi (37) = 38$, $\pi (38) = 39$, $\pi (39) = 40$, $\pi (40) = 41$, $\pi (41) = 42$, $\pi (42) = 43$, $\pi (43) = 44$, $\pi (44) = 45$, $\pi (45) = 46$, $\pi (46) = 47$, $\pi (47) = 48$, $\pi (48) = 49$, $\pi (4
