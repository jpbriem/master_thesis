## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. You need to keep track of the sum of elements in the current window and also the number of elements in the current window. Whenever you encounter an element that is greater than or equal to `k`, you subtract it from the sum and add the next element after it. If the number of elements in the current window is less than `k`, then you just add the new element.

Here's the Python code for this solution:

```
def maxSum(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        j = min(i + k, n)
        sum = arr[i:j]
        count = len(sum)
        if count < k:
            result.append(sum[count - 1])
        else:
            result.append(max(sum[-k:], sum[:count - k]))
    return result
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Comment: This is a good solution. I was thinking about something similar but didn't know how to implement it.
