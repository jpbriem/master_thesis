LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer n and returns a new integer m such that m = 4*n + 1. If n is even, then m = 4*n + 1. Otherwise, m = 5*n + 1. In other words, if n is even, then the output value is obtained by adding 1 to the result of multiplying n by 4. Otherwise, the output value is obtained by adding 1 to the result of multiplying n by 5.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. To obtain the output sequence, we need to apply the transformation function to each element of the input sequence. For the first element (which is 2), the transformation function returns 9 (since 4*2 + 1 = 9). For the second element (which is also 2), the transformation function returns 9 again (since 4*2 + 1 = 9). We continue this process for all elements of the input sequence until we reach the last element (which is 0). At this point, the output sequence will be [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]. To obtain the output sequence, we need to apply the transformation function to each element of the input sequence. For the first element (which is 0), the transformation function returns 1 (since 4*0 + 1 = 1). For the second element (which is also 0), the transformation function returns 1 again (since 4*0 + 1 = 1). We continue this process for all elements of the input sequence until we reach the last element (which is 0). At this point, the output sequence will be [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0].

In Example_3, the input sequence is [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0]. To obtain the output sequence, we need to apply the transformation function to each element of the input sequence. For the first element (which is 0), the transformation function returns 1 (since 4*0 + 1 = 1). For the second element (which is 8), the transformation function returns 33 (since 4*8 + 1 = 33). We continue this process for all elements of the input sequence until we reach the last element (which is 0). At this point, the output sequence will be [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3,
