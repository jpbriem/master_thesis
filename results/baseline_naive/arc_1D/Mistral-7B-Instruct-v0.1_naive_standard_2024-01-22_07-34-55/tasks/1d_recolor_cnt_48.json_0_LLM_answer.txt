LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array that satisfies the given conditions. In particular, we can see that in all three examples, the first element of the input array is always 0, and the last two elements are both 7. Moreover, the middle element of the input array is either 0 or 7, depending on whether there are an even number or an odd number of nonzero elements in the input array. This suggests that the transformation function should be defined recursively based on these patterns.

To implement this recursive approach, we can define a helper function `permute` that takes as input an integer `n`, which represents the length of the input array, and returns a list of all possible permutations of the input array with length `n`. We can then use this helper function to generate all possible permutations of the input array, and filter out those that do not satisfy the given conditions. Here's one way to do it:
```python
def permute(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [[0]]
    else:
        result = []
        for i in range(n):
            rest = permute(n - 1)
            for perm in rest:
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    new_perm = perm[:j] + [i] + perm[j:]
                    result.append(new_perm)
        return result

def find_permutation(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    perms = permute(n)
    valid_perms = []
    for perm in perms:
        if sum([x!= 0 for x in perm]) % 2 == 0 and perm[0] == 0 and perm[-2] == 7 and perm[-1] == 7:
            valid_perms.append(perm)
    return valid_perms
```
In this implementation, the `permute` function generates all possible permutations of the input array using recursion. It starts by returning an empty list when the length of the input array is 1 (since there is only one possible permutation). Otherwise, it generates all possible permutations of the input array by iterating over each element and appending it to every possible permutation of the remaining elements.

The `find_permutation` function takes as input the input array `arr`, calls the `permute` function to generate all possible permutations of the input array, filters out those that do not satisfy the given conditions, and returns the resulting list of valid permutations.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input array contains at least two nonzero elements. If the input array has fewer than two nonzero elements, the function will raise a `ValueError`. To handle such cases, you may want to add some additional checks before calling the `permute` function.
