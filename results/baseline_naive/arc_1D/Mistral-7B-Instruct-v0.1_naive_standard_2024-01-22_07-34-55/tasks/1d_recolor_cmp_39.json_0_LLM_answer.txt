LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) Replace all occurrences of 0 with 1 (except for the first element).
2) Replace all occurrences of 8 with 9.

Note that in Example_1, there is no need to replace any 8s because they appear only once. However, in Example_2, there are three 8s that must be replaced with 9s. Similarly, in Example_3, there are four 8s that must be replaced with 9s.

In Test case, there are five 8s that must be replaced with 9s. Therefore, the output is obtained by replacing all occurrences of 8 with 9 and then replacing all occurrences of 0 with 1 (except for the first element).

Solution:
[0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
