LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:

LLM answer:

output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation function takes an integer as input and returns the integer multiplied by itself. This means that the elements in the output sequence are all equal to the corresponding element in the input sequence squared.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to apply the transformation function to the input sequence such that the resulting output sequence satisfies the given conditions. We can start by analyzing the conditions and trying to identify any patterns or constraints that might help us determine the appropriate transformation function.

One thing we notice is that the output sequence must be sorted in ascending order. This suggests that we should use a sorting algorithm to sort the input sequence before applying the transformation function. However, since the input sequence may contain duplicates, we will need to modify our approach to handle these cases appropriately.

We can also observe that the output sequence must have no gaps between consecutive elements. This means that if two consecutive elements in the input sequence are not equal, then their corresponding elements in the output sequence must also be different. To ensure this condition is satisfied, we can use a modified version of the sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements in the input sequence and swaps them if they are not equal.

With these observations in mind, we can develop an algorithm to solve the problem as follows:

1. Sort the input sequence using a modified version of the insertion sort algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are not equal.
2. Apply the transformation function to the sorted input sequence.
3. Check if the resulting output sequence has any gaps between consecutive elements. If it does, repeat steps 1 and 2 until the output sequence has no gaps.
4. Return the final output sequence.

Here's some sample Python code that implements this algorithm:
```python
def remove_gaps(input_seq):
    # Step 1: Sort the input sequence
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        j = i + 1
        while j < len(input_seq) and input_seq[i]!= input_seq[j]:
            input_seq[i], input_seq[j] = input_seq[j], input_seq[i]
            j += 1
    
    # Step 2: Apply the transformation function
    output_seq = []
    for num in input_seq:
        output_seq.append(num * num)
    
    # Step 3: Remove gaps from the output sequence
    while True:
        prev_val = None
        for i in range(len(output_seq)):
            curr_val = output_seq[i]
            if prev_val is not None and curr_val - prev_val == 1:
                output_seq[i] -= 1
                break
            prev_val = curr_val
        
    return output_seq
```
This implementation uses the insertion sort algorithm to sort the input sequence in O(n^2) time complexity. After sorting, it applies the transformation function in O(n) time complexity. Finally, it removes gaps from the output sequence using a linear scan of the sequence in O(n) time complexity. Overall, the algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity.
