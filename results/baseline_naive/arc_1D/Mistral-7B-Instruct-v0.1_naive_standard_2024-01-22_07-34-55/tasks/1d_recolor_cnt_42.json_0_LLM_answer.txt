LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a linear transformation to the input vector. Specifically, for each element in the input vector, we first check if it is equal to 1. If it is, then we add 8 to that element; otherwise, we leave it unchanged. We repeat this process for all elements in the input vector to obtain the output vector.

We can see that the output vectors of Examples_1 and Example_2 have the same values except for the last two elements. This is because the last two elements of Example_1 are both 1, while only one of them is 1 in Example_2. Similarly, the output vectors of Examples_2 and Example_3 have the same values except for the second element. This is because the second element of Example_2 is 1, while it is 0 in Example_3. Finally, the output vectors of Examples_1 and Test case have the same values except for the third element. This is because the third element of Example_1 is 1, while it is 0 in Test case.

Therefore, we can conclude that the linear transformation applied to the input vector depends on the number of 1s in the input vector. Specifically, if there are an even number of 1s, then we add 8 to all elements; otherwise, we leave all elements unchanged.
