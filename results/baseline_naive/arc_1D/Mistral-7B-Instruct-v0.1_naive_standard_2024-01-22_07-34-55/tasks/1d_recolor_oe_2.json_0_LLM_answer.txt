LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that all elements in the input array appear exactly once in the output array. In addition, the sum of all elements in the input array is equal to the sum of all elements in the output array.

For Example_1, we can see that the input array has two zeros and three sevens. We first remove one zero from the input array and add it to the end of the output array. Then we repeat this process for the remaining zeros until there are no more zeros left in the input array. At this point, we have obtained an output array with the same sum as the input array and all elements appearing exactly once.

Similarly, for Example_2, we can see that the input array has two zeros and four sevens. We first remove one zero from the input array and add it to the end of the output array. Then we repeat this process for the remaining zeros until there are no more zeros left in the input array. At this point, we have obtained an output array with the same sum as the input array and all elements appearing exactly once.

Finally, for Example_3, we can see that the input array has two zeros and five sevens. We first remove one zero from the input array and add it to the end of the output array. Then we repeat this process for the remaining zeros until there are no more zeros left in the input array. At this point, we have obtained an output array with the same sum as the input array and all elements appearing exactly once.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is to iterate through the input array and remove one zero at a time while adding it to the end of the output array. This ensures that all elements in the input array appear exactly once in the output array and the sum of all elements in the input array is equal to the sum of all elements in the output array.
