LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array that satisfies the condition in Problem Statement.

### 6.2.2. Solution

We can solve this problem using two pointers technique. We will use two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the array and another starting from the end of the array. We will iterate through the array by incrementing the first pointer and decrementing the second pointer until we reach the middle of the array. At each iteration, if the element at the current position of the first pointer is greater than or equal to the element at the current position of the second pointer, then swap these elements. Otherwise, move the second pointer towards left. If the second pointer reaches the beginning of the array before the first pointer, then swap the elements at the positions of the first and second pointers. This process continues until both pointers meet in the middle of the array.

Let us consider Example_1 as an illustration of the solution. Initially, the first pointer points to the first element (0) and the second pointer points to the last element (5). Since 0 is less than 5, we do not swap their positions. Now, we move the second pointer towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 4). Since 0 is still less than 4, we do not swap their positions. Now, we move the second pointer again towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 3). Since 0 is now greater than or equal to 3, we swap their positions. The updated array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Now, we move the second pointer towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 2). Since 0 is still greater than 2, we do not swap their positions. Now, we move the second pointer again towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 1). Since 0 is now greater than 1, we swap their positions. The updated array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Now, we move the second pointer towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 0). Since 0 is now greater than 0, we swap their positions. The final updated array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Now let us consider Example_2 as an illustration of the solution. Initially, the first pointer points to the first element (0) and the second pointer points to the last element (4). Since 0 is less than 4, we do not swap their positions. Now, we move the second pointer towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 3). Since 0 is still less than 3, we do not swap their positions. Now, we move the second pointer again towards left by decrementing it by 1. The new values of the pointers are (first = 0, second = 2). Since 0 is now greater than 2, we swap their positions. The updated array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
