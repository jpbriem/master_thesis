LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Answer (1)

You can use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. You will need to keep track of the sum of elements in the current window and also the sum of elements in the previous window. Whenever you encounter an element that is greater than or equal to the sum of the previous window, you update the sum of the current window by subtracting the sum of the previous window from it. If the updated sum is less than or equal to zero, then you have found a solution.

Here's some sample code in Python that implements this algorithm:

```
def findSubArraySum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    curr_sum = prev_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if curr_sum + arr[i] >= prev_sum:
            curr_sum -= prev_sum
        prev_sum = curr_sum
        if curr_sum <= 0:
            return i+1
    return -1
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
