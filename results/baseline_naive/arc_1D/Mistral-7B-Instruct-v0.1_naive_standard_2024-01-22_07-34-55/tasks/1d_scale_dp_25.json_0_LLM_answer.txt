LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) If the current element in the input sequence is zero, then it should be replaced with the next non-zero element in the input sequence.

2) Otherwise, if the current element in the input sequence is not zero, then it should be replaced with itself plus one.

For example, in Example_1, the first element in the input sequence is 2, which is not zero. Therefore, it is replaced with itself plus one (i.e., 2 + 1 = 3). Similarly, the second element in the input sequence is also 2, which is not zero. Therefore, it is replaced with itself plus one (i.e., 2 + 1 = 3). This process continues until all elements in the input sequence have been transformed into their corresponding outputs.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]
