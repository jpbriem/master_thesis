LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists in replacing all occurrences of 0 with 1, except for the first one, which is replaced with 8. This can be done using a simple loop that iterates over the elements of the input sequence and replaces them according to the given rule.

Note that the test case has an additional constraint on the output sequence: it must have length 14. This means that we need to pad the output sequence with zeros if necessary. We can do this by adding a final zero element after the last non-zero element in the output sequence.

Here's the Python code that implements the above transformation:
```python
def transform(input):
    output = []
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(input)):
        if i == 0 or input[i - 1]!= 0:
            output.append(input[i])
        else:
            output.append(count + 1)
            count += 1
    return output

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

for input in test_cases:
    output = transform(input)
    assert len(output) == 14, f"Expected output length {14} but got {len(

Solution:
[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
