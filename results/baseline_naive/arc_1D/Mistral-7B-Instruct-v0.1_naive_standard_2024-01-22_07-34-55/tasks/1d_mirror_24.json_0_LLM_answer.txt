LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array that satisfies the condition in Problem Statement.

### 4.2. Algorithm Design

We use a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We first sort the input array in ascending order. Then we iterate through the sorted array and for each element, we find its position in the original unsorted array and swap it with the element at that position. This way, after the iteration, the largest element will be at the end of the array. We repeat this process until all elements have been swapped. Finally, we return the sorted array.

Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of our algorithm. Algorithm 1. Greedy Sorting Algorithm.Input: arr[]---an array of integersOutput: arr[]---the sorted arrayFunction 1.1. Sort the Input ArraySort the input array in ascending order using any sorting algorithm such as bubble sort or insertion sort.Function 1.2. Find Largest ElementFind the index of the largest element in the sorted array.Function 1.3. Swap ElementsSwap the largest element with the element at the end of the unsorted array.Repeat steps 1.2 and 1.3 until all elements have been swapped.Return the sorted array.

## 5. Performance Analysis

In this section, we analyze the time complexity of our algorithm. Let us consider an input array of n elements. In step 1.1, we sort the input array which takes O(n log n) time using any sorting algorithm. After sorting, we perform n − 1 passes over the input array in step 1.2 and 1.3. Each pass involves finding the maximum element and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted array. Since we only need to find the maximum element once in each pass, the time complexity of each pass is O(1). Therefore, the total time complexity of our algorithm is O(n log n + (n − 1)).

## 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a simple greedy algorithm to solve the problem of finding the kth smallest element in an unsorted array. Our algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n + (n − 1)), where n is the number of elements in the input array. We also provided some test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
