LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) Replace all occurrences of 0 with 6.
2) Remove all elements from the end of the sequence until there are no more 6's left.

Note that in Example_1, the first element is also replaced with 6 because it is not at the end of the sequence. However, in Examples_2 and _3, the first element is not replaced because it is at the end of the sequence.

Your task is to implement this transformation using Python code. You may assume that the input sequence will always contain only positive integers.

Solution:
[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0]
