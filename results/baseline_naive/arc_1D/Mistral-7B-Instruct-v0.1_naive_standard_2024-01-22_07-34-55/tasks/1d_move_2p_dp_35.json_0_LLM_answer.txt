LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input sequence. In particular, we can see that the first element in the output sequence is always the last element in the input sequence, and the second element in the output sequence is always the second last element in the input sequence, and so on. This means that the permutation applied to the input sequence is simply a cyclic shift of the elements towards the left.

We will use this observation to design an algorithm for finding all possible permutations of a given sequence. We will represent a permutation as a list of integers, where each integer represents the position of its corresponding element in the original sequence. For example, if the original sequence is [a, b, c], then the permutation [2, 1, 0] corresponds to the sequence [c, b, a].

To find all possible permutations of a given sequence, we can generate all possible lists of integers from 0 to n-1 (where n is the length of the original sequence), and check which ones correspond to valid permutations. A permutation is valid if it satisfies the condition that the sum of the positions of any two distinct elements in the permutation is greater than or equal to their difference.

For example, consider the sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. To find all possible permutations, we need to generate all possible lists of integers from 0 to 4, and check which ones satisfy the above condition. The possible permutations are:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] -> valid
[0, 1, 3, 2, 4] -> valid
[0, 2, 1, 3, 4] -> valid
[0, 2, 3, 1, 4] -> valid
[0, 3, 1, 2, 4] -> valid
[0, 3, 2, 1, 4] -> valid
[1, 0, 2, 3, 4] -> valid
[1, 0, 3, 2, 4] -> valid
[1, 2, 0, 3, 4] -> valid
[1, 2, 3, 0, 4] -> valid
[1, 3, 0, 2, 4] -> valid
[1, 3, 2, 0, 4] -> valid
[2, 0, 1, 3, 4] -> valid
[2, 0, 3, 1, 4] -> valid
[2, 1, 0, 3, 4] -> valid
[2, 1, 3, 0, 4] -> valid
[2, 3, 0, 1, 4] -> valid
[2, 3, 1, 0, 4] -> valid
[3, 0, 1, 2, 4] -> valid
[3, 0, 2, 1, 4] -> valid
[3, 1, 0, 2, 4] -> valid
[3, 1, 2, 0, 4] -> valid
[4, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> invalid
[4, 0, 2, 1, 3] -> invalid
[4, 1, 0, 2, 3] -> invalid
[4, 1, 2, 0, 3] -> invalid
[4, 2, 0, 1, 3] -> invalid
[4, 2, 1, 0, 3] -> invalid
[4, 3, 0, 1, 2] -> invalid
[4, 3, 1, 0, 2] -> invalid

Note that there are 5! = 120 possible permutations of the sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], but only 6 of them are valid.

Now let's implement the algorithm using Python code. We will define a function called permute that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all
