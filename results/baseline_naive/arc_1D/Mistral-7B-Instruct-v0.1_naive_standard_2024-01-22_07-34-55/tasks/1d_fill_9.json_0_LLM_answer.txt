LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that all elements in the input array appear exactly once in the output array. In Example_1, the first element appears twice in the output array, but it does not appear anywhere else in the input array. Similarly, in Example_2, the second element appears twice in the output array, but it does not appear anywhere else in the input array. In Example_3, the third element appears twice in the output array, but it does not appear anywhere else in the input array. In Test case, the fourth element appears twice in the output array, but it does not appear anywhere else in the input array.

Note that the order of the elements in the input array does not affect the output of the function. Also note that the function should return an empty list if there exists no permutation of the input array such that all elements in the input array appear exactly once in the output array.
