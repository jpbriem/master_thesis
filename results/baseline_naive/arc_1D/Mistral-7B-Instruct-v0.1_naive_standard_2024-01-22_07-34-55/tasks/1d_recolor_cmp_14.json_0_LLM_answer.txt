LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation function takes the form of a linear combination of two functions: f(x) = x + k and g(x) = -k*x. The coefficients k and -k*x are determined by the values in the input sequence. Specifically, if there are n zeros in the input sequence, then k = 1/n and -k*x = x for all x in the input sequence. If there are m non-zero elements in the input sequence, then k = 1/(m+1) and -k*x = (m+1)*x for all x in the input sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence has 5 zeros and 6 non-zero elements. Therefore, k = 1/5 and -k*x = x for all x in the input sequence. Applying these transformations to the input sequence yields the output sequence [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0].

In Test case, the input sequence has 7 zeros and 3 non-zero elements. Therefore, k = 1/7 and -k*x = x for all x in the input sequence. Applying these transformations to the input sequence yields the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9].
