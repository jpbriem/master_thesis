LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence. The transformation function takes as input an integer array and returns another integer array. The transformation function can be expressed in terms of two operations: (i) concatenation of two arrays and (ii) addition of two elements. In Example_1, the first element of the output array is 0 because it is the result of concatenating the first element of the input array with the second element of the input array. Similarly, the last element of the output array is also 0 because it is the result of concatenating the last element of the input array with the second last element of the input array. All other elements of the output array are obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the input array.

Similarly, in Example_2, the first element of the output array is 0 because it is the result of concatenating the first element of the input array with the second element of the input array. However, all other elements of the output array are obtained by subtracting the corresponding elements of the input array from 5.

In Example_3, the first element of the output array is 0 because it is the result of concatenating the first element of the input array with the second element of the input array. However, all other elements of the output array are obtained by subtracting the corresponding elements of the input array from 5.

In Test case, the input array contains only zeros and ones. Therefore, the output array will contain only zeros and ones.

Solution:
[0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
