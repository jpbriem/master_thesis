LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a list that contains only one element which is the sum of all elements in the input list.

### 4.2. Algorithmic Approach

We propose an algorithmic approach to solve this problem using a recursive function. We first check if the length of the input list is less than or equal to 1. If it is true then we return the value at index 0 as the sum of the input list. Otherwise, we call the recursive function with the sublist from index 1 to n−1 (where n is the length of the input list) and add the value at index 0 to the result obtained by calling the recursive function on the sublist from index 1 to n−1. This process continues until the base case is reached.

Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode for our proposed algorithm.

### 4.3. Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of our proposed algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we need to iterate through the entire input list once to obtain the sum of its elements.

## 5. Implementation

We implemented our proposed algorithm in Python programming language. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of our implementation.

Figure 1. Flowchart of our implementation.

Our implementation consists of two functions: `sumList` and `main`. The `sumList` function takes an integer array as input and returns the sum of its elements. The `main` function reads the input array from user and calls the `sumList` function to compute the sum of its elements. It then prints the computed sum.

## 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the sum of elements in a given integer array. Our proposed algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We have also provided some test cases to demonstrate the correctness of our algorithm.
