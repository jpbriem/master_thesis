LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that the first element is 1 and all other elements are either 0 or 1. In Example_1, the second element is also 1 because it has an even number of 0s before it. In Example_2, the second element is also 1 because it has an odd number of 0s before it. In Example_3, the second element is 0 because it has an even number of 0s before it. In Test case, the second element is also 1 because it has an odd number of 0s before it.

Note that in Examples_1 and Test case, the third element is also 1 because it has an even number of 0s before it. However, this is not true for Example_2 and Example_3 because they have different numbers of 0s before the third element. Therefore, we cannot use a simple rule to determine whether the third element should be 0 or 1 based on the number of 0s before it. Instead, we need to check if the sum of the number of 0s before the current element and the number of 1s after the current element is even or odd. If it is even, then the current element should be 0; otherwise, it should be 1. This works because if the sum is even, then there must be an equal number of 0s and 1s between the current element and the end of the array (i.e., the next element will be 1), so the current element should be 0. On the other hand, if the sum is odd, then there must be one more 1 than 0s between the current element and the end of the array (i.e., the next element will be 0), so the current element should be 1.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
