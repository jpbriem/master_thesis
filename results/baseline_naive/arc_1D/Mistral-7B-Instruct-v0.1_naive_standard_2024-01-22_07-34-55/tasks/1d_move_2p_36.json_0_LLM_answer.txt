LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array such that all elements except for one element are repeated twice. This means that there exists an index i in the input array where the value at index i is not repeated. We can use this observation to solve the problem.

We first sort the input array in ascending order. Then we iterate through the sorted array from left to right and check if the current element has already been seen before. If it has not been seen before, we add it to a set S. Otherwise, we skip it. After iterating through the entire array, we have obtained a subset S of the original array such that every element in S is unique. We then create a new array T by adding two copies of each element in S to T. Finally, we return T as the output.

Note that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. However, since the input size is small enough (at most 10^4), this algorithm should be efficient enough for most cases.
