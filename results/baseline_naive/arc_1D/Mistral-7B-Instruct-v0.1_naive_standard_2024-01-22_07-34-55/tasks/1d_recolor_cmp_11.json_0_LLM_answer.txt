LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts: firstly, it replaces all occurrences of 0 with 7; secondly, it replaces all occurrences of 7 with 9.

For Example_1, the input sequence contains three 0s and four 7s. After replacing all occurrences of 0 with 7, we obtain [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]. Then, after replacing all occurrences of 7 with 9, we obtain the final output sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0].

Similarly, for Example_2, the input sequence contains three 0s and five 7s. After replacing all occurrences of 0 with 7, we obtain [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then, after replacing all occurrences of 7 with 9, we obtain the final output sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Finally, for Example_3, the input sequence contains one 0 and six 7s. After replacing all occurrences of 0 with 7, we obtain [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]. Then, after replacing all occurrences of 7 with 9, we obtain the final output sequence [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7].

Note that in all three examples, the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence, but its elements are different. This means that the transformation preserves the order of the elements in the input sequence.

In summary, the given problem can be solved using a simple replacement transformation consisting of two steps: firstly, replace all occurrences of 0 with 7; secondly, replace all occurrences of 7 with 9.

[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
