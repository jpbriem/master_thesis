LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation to the input sequence. In this case, the transformation consists of two parts:

1) Repeat the first element in the input sequence until it reaches the length of the input sequence.
2) Append the last element of the input sequence to the repeated first element.

For example, for Example_1, the transformed sequence is obtained as follows:
Repeated first element: 7 (since there are 7 elements in the input sequence)
Last element: 9
Transformed sequence: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9]

Similarly, for Example_2, the transformed sequence is obtained as follows:
Repeated first element: 6 (since there are 6 elements in the input sequence)
Last element: 9
Transformed sequence: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9]

And so on.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
