LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 3s. Each sequence of 3s is followed by a sequence of 0s. The length of each sequence is variable, but the total number of sequences is fixed at 8.

For example, in the first input, there are 8 sequences of 3s, each followed by a sequence of 0s. In the second input, there are also 8 sequences of 3s, but with different lengths. In the third input, there are no sequences of 3s, only sequences of 0s.

To apply this transformation pattern to an input, we simply iterate through the elements of the input array and replace each element that is not a 0 or a 3 with a 0. This results in an output array where all non-zero elements have been replaced with 0s.

Solution:
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
