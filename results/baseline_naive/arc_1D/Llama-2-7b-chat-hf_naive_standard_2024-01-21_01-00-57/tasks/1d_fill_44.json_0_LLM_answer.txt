LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution pattern, where each occurrence of '0' is replaced by the corresponding element in the output sequence. For example, in the first input-output pair, every '0' in the input sequence is replaced by a '2'. Similarly, in the second input-output pair, every '0' in the input sequence is replaced by a '4', and so on.

In the third input-output pair, the pattern is slightly different, where every '0' is replaced by either a '7' or a '0', depending on the previous element in the input sequence. This pattern can be represented using a more complex substitution pattern, such as:

{0 -> 7 if prev == 0} {0 -> 0 otherwise}

where "prev" refers to the previous element in the input sequence.

Finally, in the test case, the input sequence contains three occurrences of '0', which are all replaced by the corresponding elements in the output sequence.

[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
