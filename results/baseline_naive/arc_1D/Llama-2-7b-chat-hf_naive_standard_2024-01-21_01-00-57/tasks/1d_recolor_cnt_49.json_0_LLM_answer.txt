LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output with a different number of elements (from 10 to 8) by applying the same sequence of bitwise AND operations as in Example_1. Each operation combines two adjacent elements in the input array, resulting in a new element in the output array. For example, the first operation combines the first two elements of the input array (both equal to 0), producing a new element in the output array that is also equal to 0. Similarly, the second operation combines the third and fourth elements of the input array (both equal to 3), producing a new element in the output array that is equal to 9. This process continues until all input elements have been combined, resulting in an output array with twice the number of elements as the input array.

Solution:
[0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
