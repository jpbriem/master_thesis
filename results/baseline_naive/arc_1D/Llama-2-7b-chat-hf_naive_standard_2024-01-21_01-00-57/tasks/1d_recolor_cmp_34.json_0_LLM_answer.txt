LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations to each element in the input sequence. Specifically, for each element x in the input sequence, the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and a binary string of length 8 (i.e., 0b10000000) is obtained. This process is repeated for each element in the input sequence, resulting in the corresponding elements in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]. In this example, the bitwise AND operation between each element and the binary string 0b10000000 results in the corresponding element being set to 0 or 8, depending on whether it is even or odd.

In general, the transformation pattern can be described as follows: given an input sequence of n elements, apply a series of bitwise AND operations to each element, using a binary string of length 2^n-1 (i.e., 0b111...111) as the mask. The resulting sequence will have the same number of elements as the input sequence, and will contain only the low-order bits of the original elements that are set to 1 after the bitwise AND operation.
