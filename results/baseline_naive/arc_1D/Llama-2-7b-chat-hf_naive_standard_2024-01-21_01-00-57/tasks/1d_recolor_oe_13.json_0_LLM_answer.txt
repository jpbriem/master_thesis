LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that consists of all ones followed by a single one in the most significant position (i.e., the rightmost bit). The resulting product is then taken as the new value for each element in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first input element is multiplied by the binary mask [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], which results in the value 0. The second input element is multiplied by the same mask, resulting in the value 0 as well. This process continues until all input elements have been processed, resulting in the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0].

In general, the transformation pattern can be described as follows:
Given an input sequence of length $n$, apply the following operation to each element $x_i$ in the sequence:

$$y_i = x_i \cdot (1 << i)$$

where $<<$ denotes the bitshift operator left shifting the binary representation of $i$ by $i$ bits.

For example, if the input sequence is $[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]$, the transformation would produce the output sequence $[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]$.
