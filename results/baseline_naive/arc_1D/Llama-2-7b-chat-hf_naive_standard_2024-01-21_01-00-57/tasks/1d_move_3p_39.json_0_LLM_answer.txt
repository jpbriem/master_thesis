LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher, where each bit in the input is replaced by a fixed number of bits to the right (or left) according to the position of the bit in the input sequence. For example, the first bit in the input is replaced by the second bit, the second bit is replaced by the third bit, and so on. This process continues until all bits in the input have been replaced by their corresponding bits in the output sequence.

In this particular instance, the substitution is always by one bit to the right or left, regardless of the value of the bit being substituted. Therefore, the resulting output sequence will consist of alternating runs of consecutive values, with each run ending at an odd-numbered index (since the last bit in the input sequence is not changed).

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
