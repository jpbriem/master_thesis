LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations to each element in the input sequence. Specifically, for each element x in the input sequence, the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and a binary string of length 4 (i.e., 0b100) is obtained. This process is repeated for each element in the input sequence, resulting in the corresponding elements in the output sequence.

For example, in the first input sequence, the element at index 0 is multiplied by 0b100, resulting in the value 0. Similarly, the element at index 2 is multiplied by 0b100, resulting in the value 2. The remaining elements in the input sequence are not affected by this operation, as they are either 0 or 2.

In the second input sequence, the element at index 0 is multiplied by 0b100, resulting in the value 0. The element at index 2 is multiplied by 0b100, resulting in the value 2. The element at index 4 is multiplied by 0b100, resulting in the value 2. The remaining elements in the input sequence are not affected by this operation, as they are either 0 or 2.

In the third input sequence, all elements are multiplied by 0b100, resulting in the values listed in the output sequence.

In summary, the given transformation pattern consists of applying a series of bitwise AND operations to each element in the input sequence, where each operation involves multiplying the element by a binary string of length 4 (i.e., 0b100).
