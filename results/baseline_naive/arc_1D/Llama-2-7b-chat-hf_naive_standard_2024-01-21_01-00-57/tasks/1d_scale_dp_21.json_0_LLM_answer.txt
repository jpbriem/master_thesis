LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0]

Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 1s and 0s. Each sequence of 4 or more consecutive 1s is replaced by the corresponding number from the previous sequence (modulo 8). For example, in the first input sequence, the sequence of 4 consecutive 1s is replaced by the number 7, which is the result of modulo 8 of the previous sequence. Similarly, in the second input sequence, the sequence of 4 consecutive 5s is replaced by the number 5, and so on.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided test cases and explanation, it can be concluded that the given transformation pattern is a simple cyclical rotation of digits within each sequence of 4 or more consecutive elements, where each rotation is performed modulo 8.
