LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of two parts:

Part 1: Replace each element with its nearest neighbor (clockwise). If there is a tie, repeat the replacement until no more ties remain. For example, in the first input, the element at index 5 is replaced by the element at index 6 because they are closest neighbors clockwise. In the second input, the element at index 3 is replaced by the element at index 4 because they are closer than any other pair.

Part 2: After applying Part 1, replace each element with a copy of itself. This step ensures that the output has the same number of elements as the input. For example, in the third input, the element at index 7 is replaced by a copy of itself, resulting in an output with eight elements.

Conclusion:
Given an array of integers, apply the following transformation pattern:
Replace each element with its nearest neighbor (clockwise) and then replace each element with a copy of itself. Test cases and explanations demonstrate how to apply this pattern to achieve the desired output.
