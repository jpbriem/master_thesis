LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that consists of all ones followed by a single one in the position corresponding to the index of the current element in the input sequence. For example, the first element in the input sequence is multiplied by the binary mask [1, 0, 0,..., 0], which results in a product of 1, and the second element is multiplied by the binary mask [0, 1, 0,..., 0], which results in a product of 0. This process continues until all elements in the input sequence have been processed. The resulting bits are then grouped into sequences of length 8, where each sequence contains only ones or zeros.
