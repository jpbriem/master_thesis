LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position j in the output sequence should also be equal to 0. If the value at position i in the input sequence is not equal to 0, then the value at position j in the output sequence should be equal to the value at position i modulo 2.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, so the value at position 0 in the output sequence should also be 0. In the second input-output pair, the values at positions 0 and 5 in the input sequence are both equal to 0, so the values at positions 0 and 5 in the output sequence should also be 0. In the third input-output pair, the value at position 4 in the input sequence is equal to 4, so the value at position 4 in the output sequence should be equal to 4.

In general, the transformation pattern can be applied repeatedly to any input sequence to produce an output sequence with the same structure but with all non-zero values replaced by 0.
