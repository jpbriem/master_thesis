LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is applied to each element in the input sequence, resulting in a transformed sequence. The rules are as follows:

1. If the current element is 0, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence).
2. If the current element is not 0, then it is replaced by the next element from the input sequence (modulo 8). This means that if the current element is at position i in the input sequence, then its replacement value is obtained by taking the next element from the input sequence (starting from 0), and shifting it by i positions to the right. For example, if the current element is at position 3 in the input sequence, then its replacement value is obtained by taking the next element from the input sequence (which is at position 4), and shifting it by 3 positions to the right.

For example, consider the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Applying the rules above, we get the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Similarly, for the input sequence [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], applying the rules gives us the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Finally, for the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], applying the rules gives us the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].
