LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k.

For example, in Example_1, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also 0. Similarly, the second rule is (3, 9), which means that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is 3, then the value at position 9 in the output sequence is also 9.

In Example_2, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also 0. The second rule is (3, 3), which means that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is 3, then the value at position 3 in the output sequence is also 3.

In Example_3, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also 0. The second rule is (3, 9), which means that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is 3, then the value at position 9 in the output sequence is also 9.

The test case demonstrates how the transformation pattern can be applied to a specific input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.
