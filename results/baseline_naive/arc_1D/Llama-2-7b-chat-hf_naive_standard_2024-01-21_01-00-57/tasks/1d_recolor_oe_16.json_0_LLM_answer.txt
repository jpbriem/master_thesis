LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is a sequence of binary digits (0 or 1) arranged in a row. Each digit in the input represents the number of times the corresponding element in the output sequence appears to its left. For example, the first digit in the input sequence is 0, which means that there are no elements in the output sequence that appear to its left. The second digit is 1, which means that there is one element in the output sequence that appears to its left. Similarly, the third and fourth digits represent the presence of two and three elements in the output sequence that appear to their left, respectively.

The output sequence is constructed by iteratively adding the value of each digit in the input sequence to a running total. Whenever a 0 appears in the input sequence, the running total is reset to zero. Otherwise, the running total is incremented by the value of the digit.

For example, in the first input sequence, the output sequence would start with the value 0, since there are no elements in the input sequence that appear to its left. Then, when the first digit in the input sequence is 1, the output sequence would be updated to [0, 1], since there is now one element in the output sequence that appears to its left. When the next digit in the input sequence is also 1, the output sequence would be updated to [0, 2], and so on.

In general, the output sequence will have twice as many elements as the input sequence, and each element in the output sequence will represent the number of times an element appears to its left in the input sequence.
