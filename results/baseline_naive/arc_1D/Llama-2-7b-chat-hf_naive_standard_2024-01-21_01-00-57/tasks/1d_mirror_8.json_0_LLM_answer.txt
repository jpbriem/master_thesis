LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output by repeatedly applying the following simple transformation rule: if the current element is equal to 0, then it becomes 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. This transformation can be visualized as a series of "flip" operations, where each flip changes all elements that are currently equal to 0 to 1, and vice versa.

For example, in the first input, all elements are initially equal to 0, so after one application of the transformation rule, they become all equal to 1. After two applications, they become all equal to 2, and so on. Similarly, in the second input, all elements are initially equal to 0, so after one application of the transformation rule, they become all equal to 1; after two applications, they become all equal to 2, and so on. In the third input, only the last three elements are non-zero, so after one application of the transformation rule, they become all equal to 1; after two applications, they remain unchanged at 3, 3, and 3.

In the test case, the input contains five consecutive elements equal to 5, followed by zeroes, so after one application of the transformation rule, the first five elements become all equal to 1, while the remaining elements remain unchanged.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
