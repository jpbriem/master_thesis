LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 7s. Each sequence of 7s is followed by a sequence of 0s. The length of each sequence of 7s is equal to the number of elements in the input array minus 1 (i.e., n - 1). For example, in the first input array, there are 8 elements, so the longest sequence of 7s has length 8. In the second and third input arrays, there are 9 elements, so the longest sequence of 7s has length 9.

In the output array, each element is either 0 or 7, depending on whether it is an even or odd index, respectively. This is because the transformation pattern consists only of 0s and 7s, with no other values present. Therefore, the output array will consist only of 0s and 7s, with the same distribution as the input array.
