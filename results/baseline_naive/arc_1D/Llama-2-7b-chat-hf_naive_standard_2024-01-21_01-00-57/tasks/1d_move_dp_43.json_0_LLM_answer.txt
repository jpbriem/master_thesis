LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 2s. Each sequence of 2s is replaced by the next sequence of 2s in the original input sequence. For example, the first occurrence of [2, 2] in the input sequence becomes [0, 0], since it is replaced by the next sequence of 2s (i.e., [2, 2]). Similarly, the second occurrence of [2, 2] becomes [0, 0], and so on. Therefore, the output sequence is obtained by replacing each sequence of 2s in the input sequence with the next sequence of 2s.
