LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7]

Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher, where each bit in the input is replaced by a fixed number of bits to the right (or left) according to a specific rule. In this case, the rule is that if the input bit is 1, it is replaced by the next bit to the right (or left), otherwise it is kept unchanged.

For example, in the first input, all bits are replaced by the next bit to the right, resulting in the output sequence. Similarly, in the second input, all bits are replaced by the next bit to the left, resulting in the output sequence. In the third input, only the fifth bit is replaced by the next bit to the right, resulting in the output sequence. And in the test case, all bits are replaced by the next bit to the right, resulting in the output sequence.

[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
