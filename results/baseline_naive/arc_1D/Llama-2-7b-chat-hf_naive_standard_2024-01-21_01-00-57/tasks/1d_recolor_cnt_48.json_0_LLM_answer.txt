LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the output sequence is calculated as the result of an AND operation between its corresponding element in the input sequence and a binary string of length equal to the number of bits used for each element in the output sequence (i.e., 32-bits).

For example, in Example_1, the first four input elements are ANDed with the binary string "0000000000000000000000000000000", resulting in the output element "0". The next three input elements are ANDed with the binary string "0000000000000000000000000000000", resulting in the output element "0". This process continues until all input elements have been processed, resulting in the final output sequence.

In general, the transformation pattern can be described as follows:
Given an input sequence of length $n$, apply a series of $k$ bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence, where each operation involves a binary string of length $k$. The resulting output sequence has length $n/k$.
