LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output by repeatedly applying the following simple transformation rule: if the current element is zero, set it to the previous non-zero element; otherwise, set it to twice the previous non-zero element.

For example, in the first input, all elements are initially zero except for the third element, which is 3. In the second step, the fourth element becomes 6 (twice 3), and so on. Similarly, in the second input, all elements are initially zero except for the fourth element, which is 4. In the third step, the fifth element becomes 8 (twice 4), and so on.

In the third input, all elements are initially zero except for the fifth element, which is 5. In the fourth step, the sixth element becomes 10 (twice 5), and so on.

In the last input, all elements are initially zero except for the seventh element, which is 5. In the eighth step, the ninth element becomes 10 (twice 5), and so on.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
