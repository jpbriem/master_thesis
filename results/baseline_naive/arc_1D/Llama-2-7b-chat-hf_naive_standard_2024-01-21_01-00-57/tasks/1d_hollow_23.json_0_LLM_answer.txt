LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is applied to each element in the input sequence, resulting in a transformed sequence. The rules are as follows:

1. If the current element is 0, then the next element in the output sequence is also 0.
2. If the current element is greater than or equal to 2, then the next element in the output sequence is the opposite value (i.e., if the current element is 2, then the next element in the output sequence is 0).
3. If the current element is the last element in the input sequence, then the next element in the output sequence is also the opposite value (i.e., if the current element is 0, then the next element in the output sequence is 2).

By applying these rules repeatedly to the input sequence, we obtain the corresponding output sequence.
