LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to certain patterns. Here are the rules for this particular pattern:

1. If the current element is 0, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes the output element).
2. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5, then it is replaced by 0.
3. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 6 and less than or equal to 9, then it is replaced by 5.
4. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 15, then it is replaced by 0.
5. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 16 and less than or equal to 21, then it is replaced by 5.
6. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 22 and less than or equal to 27, then it is replaced by 0.
7. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 33, then it is replaced by 5.
8. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 34 and less than or equal to 39, then it is replaced by 0.
9. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 40 and less than or equal to 45, then it is replaced by 5.
10. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 46 and less than or equal to 51, then it is replaced by 0.
11. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 57, then it is replaced by 5.
12. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 58 and less than or equal to 63, then it is replaced by 0.
13. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 64 and less than or equal to 69, then it is replaced by 5.
14. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 75, then it is replaced by 0.
15. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 76 and less than or equal to 81, then it is replaced by 5.
16. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 82 and less than or equal to 87, then it is replaced by 0.
17. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 88 and less than or equal to 93, then it is replaced by 5.
18. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 94 and less than or equal to 99, then it is replaced by 0.
19. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 100 and less than or equal to 105, then it is replaced by 5.
20. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 106 and less than or equal to 111, then it is replaced by 0.
21. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 112 and less than or equal to 117, then it is replaced by 5.
22. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 118 and less than or equal to 123, then it is replaced by 0.
23. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 124 and less than or equal to 129, then it is replaced by 5.
24. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 130 and less than or equal to 135, then it is replaced by 0.
25. Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 136 and less than or equal to 141, then it is replaced by 5
