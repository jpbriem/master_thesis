LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations to each element in the input sequence. Specifically, for each element x in the input sequence, the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and a binary string of length k (where k is the number of elements in the input sequence) is assigned as the corresponding element in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]. In this process, each element x in the input sequence is paired with a binary string of length k that has all bits set to 0 except for the ith bit, which is set to 1 if x has a value of 1 at position i. For instance, the first element in the input sequence has a value of 0, so its pairing with the binary string [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a value of 0 in the corresponding position in the output sequence. Similarly, the second element in the input sequence has a value of 0, so its pairing with the binary string [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a value of 0 in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

In Example_2, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]. In this process, each element x in the input sequence is paired with a binary string of length k that has all bits set to 0 except for the ith bit, which is set to 1 if x has a value of 1 at position i. For instance, the first element in the input sequence has a value of 0, so its pairing with the binary string [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a value of 0 in the corresponding position in the output sequence. Similarly, the second element in the input sequence has a value of 4, so its pairing with the binary string [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] results in a value of 4 in the corresponding position in the output sequence.

In Example_3, the input sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
