LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to the value at position j in the output sequence, then the value at position i+1 in the input sequence should be replaced with the value at position j+1 in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first rule applies to positions 0 and 6 in both the input and output sequences. The rule states that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is equal to the value at position 6 in the output sequence, then the value at position 1 in the input sequence should be replaced with the value at position 7 in the output sequence. Similarly, the second rule applies to positions 2 and 6 in both the input and output sequences, and so on.

In Example_2, the third rule applies to positions 3 and 6 in both the input and output sequences. The rule states that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is equal to the value at position 6 in the output sequence, then the value at position 4 in the input sequence should be replaced with the value at position 7 in the output sequence.

In Example_3, the fourth rule applies to positions 3 and 0 in both the input and output sequences. The rule states that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is equal to the value at position 0 in the output sequence, then the value at position 4 in the input sequence should be replaced with the value at position 3 in the output sequence.

The test case demonstrates how the transformation pattern can be applied to a specific input sequence to produce the corresponding output sequence.
