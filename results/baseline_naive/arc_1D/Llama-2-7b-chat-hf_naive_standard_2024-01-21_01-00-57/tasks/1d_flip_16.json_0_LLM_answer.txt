LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating increments and decrements of 4. Each increment or decrease is applied to all elements in the input array. For example, in Example_1, each element is increased by 4, except for the last two elements which are decreased by 4. In Example_2, each element is increased by 4, except for the first element which is decreased by 4. In Example_3, each element is increased by 5, except for the last element which is decreased by 5.

Conclusion:
Based on the provided test cases and explanation, it can be concluded that the given transformation pattern is a cyclical pattern with a period of 4.
