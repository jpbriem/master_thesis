LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output with the same number of elements as the input. Each element in the input is either multiplied by a factor or added to its previous value. The factors used are always between 0 and 1, inclusive. For example, in Example_1, the first element is multiplied by 8, the second element is multiplied by 5, and so on. In Example_2, the third element is added to its previous value (which is also 7), and so on. In Example_3, all elements are multiplied by 5.

Conclusion:
Given an array of integers, transform it into another array of integers using a simple algorithm that applies a series of multiplication and addition operations to each element, where the factors used are between 0 and 1, inclusive.
