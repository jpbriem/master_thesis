LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]
Expected output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Note that in each example, the first digit of the input is zero, followed by a sequence of non-zero digits (in this case, either 9 or 0). The transformation pattern involves replacing each sequence of non-zero digits with a corresponding sequence of digits based on the position of the sequence within the input array. For example, in Example_1, the sequence of three consecutive non-zero digits (i.e., 9s) at index 3 is replaced by the sequence of digits 1 and 7, which correspond to the positions of these digits in the output array. Similarly, in Example_2, the sequence of two consecutive non-zero digits (i.e., 9s) at index 5 is replaced by the sequence of digits 7 and 0, which correspond to the positions of these digits in the output array.
