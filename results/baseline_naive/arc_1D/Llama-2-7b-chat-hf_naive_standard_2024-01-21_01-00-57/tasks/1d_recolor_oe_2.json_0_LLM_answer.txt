LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations to each element in the input sequence. Specifically, for each element x in the input sequence, the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and a binary string of length 8 (i.e., 0b10000000) is obtained as the corresponding element in the output sequence.

For example, in the first input sequence, the element at index 0 is 0, and when it is operated on with the binary string 0b10000000, the result is 0. Similarly, the element at index 7 is also 0, so the result of operating it on with the binary string is also 0. Therefore, the output sequence contains only two non-zero elements, which correspond to the positions where the bits in the binary string match the value of the input element.

In general, the output sequence will contain only those elements that have a matching bit position in the binary string used for the operation.
