LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher where each bit in the input is replaced by a corresponding bit in the output based on the modulo operation (mod 8). In other words, if the ith bit in the input is 1, then the corresponding bit in the output is set to 7 - i.

Therefore, for example, when the input is [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], the first three bits are 0, so their corresponding outputs are also 0. The next two bits are 5, which maps to 7 - 5 = 2 in the output, so their corresponding outputs are 7. The last two bits are 0, which maps to 7 - 0 = 7 in the output, so their corresponding outputs are also 7.

Similarly, for the input [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the first three bits are 3, which maps to 7 - 3 = 4 in the output, so their corresponding outputs are 7. The next three bits are also 3, which maps to 7 - 3 = 4 in the output again, so their corresponding outputs are still 7. And the last three bits are 0, which maps to 7 - 0 = 7 in the output, so their corresponding outputs are also 7.

For the input [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], the first six bits are 0, which maps to 7 - 6 = 1 in the output, so their corresponding outputs are 7. The last two bits are 6, which maps to 7 - 6 = 1 in the output again, so their corresponding outputs are also 7.

And for the input [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], the entire input is 7, which maps to itself in the output, so all the corresponding outputs are also 7.
