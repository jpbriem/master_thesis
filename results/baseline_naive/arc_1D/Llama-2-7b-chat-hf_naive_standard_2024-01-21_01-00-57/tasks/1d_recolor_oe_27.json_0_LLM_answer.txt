LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that consists of ones and zeros. The resulting product is then taken as the new value for each position in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first input sequence is transformed into the second output sequence by performing the following operations:

* Elements 0 and 1 are multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 0, 1], resulting in values 0 and 1, respectively. These values become the new values for positions 0 and 1 in the output sequence.
* Elements 2 and 3 are multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 0, 1], resulting in values 0 and 1, respectively. These values become the new values for positions 2 and 3 in the output sequence.
* Elements 4 and 5 are multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 0, 1], resulting in values 0 and 1, respectively. These values become the new values for positions 4 and 5 in the output sequence.
* Elements 6 and 7 are multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 0, 1], resulting in values 0 and 1, respectively. These values become the new values for positions 6 and 7 in the output sequence.
* Elements 8 and 9 are multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 0, 1], resulting in values 0 and 1, respectively. These values become the new values for positions 8 and 9 in the output sequence.

In general, the transformation pattern can be described as follows:

* For each position i in the input sequence, take the corresponding element j from the input sequence.
* Multiply element j by a binary mask consisting of ones and zeros (where the number of ones is equal to the length of the input sequence minus i).
* Take the result of this multiplication as the new value for position i in the output sequence.

Note that the binary mask used in each operation is the same, but its application may produce different results depending on the input sequence.
