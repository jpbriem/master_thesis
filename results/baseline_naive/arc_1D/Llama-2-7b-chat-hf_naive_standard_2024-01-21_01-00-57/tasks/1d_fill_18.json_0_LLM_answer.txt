LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that consists of all ones except for one bit that is set to one. The resulting product is then taken with each subsequent element in the input sequence using bitwise AND operation. This process continues until the end of the input sequence is reached.

For example, in Example_1, the first element is multiplied by a binary mask consisting of all ones except for the second bit which is set to one (i.e., 0000000000000000000000000000000). The result of this multiplication is 0, since none of the bits match. Then, the next element is multiplied by the same mask, but now the second bit matches, so the result is 00000000000000000000000000000000 = 0. This process continues until the last element, where all bits match, resulting in a final value of 0.

In Example_2, the first element is multiplied by a binary mask consisting of all ones except for the third bit which is set to one (i.e., 00000000000000000000000000000000). The result of this multiplication is 1, since two of the bits match. Then, the next element is multiplied by the same mask, but now the fourth bit matches, so the result is 000000000000000000000000000000000 = 0. This process continues until the last element, where all bits match, resulting in a final value of 1.

In Example_3, the first element is multiplied by a binary mask consisting of all ones except for the seventh bit which is set to one (i.e., 00000000000000000000000000000000). The result of this multiplication is 0, since none of the bits match. Then, the next element is multiplied by the same mask, but now the seventh bit matches, so the result is 000000000000000000000000000000000 = 0. This process continues until the last element, where all bits match, resulting in a final value of 0.
