LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to the following logic:

* If the current element is zero, it remains unchanged.
* Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 3, it is replaced by the next element from the output sequence (which starts with 0 and increments by 1 for each subsequent element).

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is [0, 0, 1, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the corresponding output sequence is [0, 0, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. As you can see, the first two elements remain unchanged, while the rest are replaced by their corresponding values in the output sequence.

Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], and the corresponding output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0]. Again, the first three elements remain unchanged, while the rest are replaced by their corresponding values in the output sequence.

In Example_3, the input sequence is [5, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the corresponding output sequence is [6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Here too, the first two elements remain unchanged, while the rest are replaced by their corresponding values in the output sequence.

Finally, in Test case, the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], and the corresponding output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This test case demonstrates how the transformation pattern works when applied to a sequence with multiple zeros in a row.
