LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k modulo 2.

For example, in Example_1, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also 0. Similarly, the second rule is (1, 1), which means that if the value at position 1 in the input sequence is 1, then the value at position 1 in the output sequence is also 1.

In Example_2, the first rule is (0, 5), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 5 in the output sequence is 5. Similarly, the second rule is (5, 5), which means that if the value at position 5 in the input sequence is 5, then the value at position 5 in the output sequence is also 5.

In Example_3, the first rule is (4, 4), which means that if the value at position 4 in the input sequence is 4, then the value at position 4 in the output sequence is also 4. Similarly, the second rule is (4, 0), which means that if the value at position 4 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also 0.

The test case demonstrates how the transformation pattern can be applied to a new input sequence. In this case, all the values in the input sequence are equal to 6, except for the last two positions, which are equal to 0. Applying the transformation pattern to this input sequence results in an output sequence with all values equal to 0.
