LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is a sequence of numbers with alternating values of 0 and 8. The transformation pattern involves replacing each occurrence of 0 with its nearest neighbor (i.e., the previous or next value in the sequence). For example, the first 0 is replaced by 8, since it is the closest value to 0 in the sequence. Similarly, the second 0 is replaced by 8 again, as it is closer to 8 than any other value in the sequence. This process continues until all occurrences of 0 have been replaced. The resulting output sequence has only two values - 0 and 8 - which are repeated alternately throughout the sequence.

Solution:
[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
