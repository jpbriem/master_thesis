LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that is created by shifting the previous element to the right by one bit position. The resulting product is then taken as the new value for the corresponding position in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first input element is multiplied by the binary mask `00000000`, which results in `0`. The second input element is multiplied by `00000001`, which results in `1`. This process continues until all input elements have been processed, resulting in the final output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]`.

In Example_2, the first input element is multiplied by `00000010`, which results in `3`. The second input element is multiplied by `00000100`, which results in `6`. This process continues until all input elements have been processed, resulting in the final output sequence `[0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]`.

In Example_3, the first input element is multiplied by `00000000`, which results in `0`. The second input element is multiplied by `00000001`, which results in `1`. This process continues until all input elements have been processed, resulting in the final output sequence `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]`.

In Test Case, the input sequence is `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, which is transformed into the output sequence `[0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
