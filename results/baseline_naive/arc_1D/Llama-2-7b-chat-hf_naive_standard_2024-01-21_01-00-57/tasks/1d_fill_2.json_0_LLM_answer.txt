LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of integers (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k+1. If the value at position i in the input sequence is not equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to 0.

For example, in Example_1, the first rule applies to the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], which transforms it into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]. In this case, the value at position 0 in the input sequence is equal to 0, so the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also equal to 0. Similarly, the values at positions 1 through 4 in the input sequence are all equal to 0, so the values at positions 1 through 4 in the output sequence are also equal to 0. However, the value at position 5 in the input sequence is equal to 5, so the value at position 5 in the output sequence is equal to 6.

In Example_2, the second rule applies to the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], which transforms it into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]. In this case, the value at position 0 in the input sequence is equal to 0, so the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also equal to 0. Similarly, the values at positions 1 through 3 in the input sequence are all equal to 0, so the values at positions 1 through 3 in the output sequence are also equal to 0. However, the value at position 4 in the input sequence is equal to 5, so the value at position 4 in the output sequence is equal to 6.

In Example_3, the third rule applies to the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], which transforms it into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]. In this case, the values at positions 0 through 3 in the input sequence are all equal to 0, so the values at positions 0 through 3 in the output sequence are also equal to 0. However, the value at position 4 in the input sequence is equal to 3, so the value at position 4 in the output sequence is equal to 3.
