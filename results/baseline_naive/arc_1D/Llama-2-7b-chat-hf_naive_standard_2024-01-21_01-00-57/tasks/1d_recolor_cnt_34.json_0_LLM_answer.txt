LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND (&) operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the output sequence is calculated as the result of combining two or more elements in the input sequence using bitwise AND (&). The number of elements involved in each combination varies across different positions in the output sequence.

For example, in the first position of the output sequence, we have three elements in the input sequence (0, 0, 2), which are combined using bitwise AND (&) to produce the output value of 0. In the second position, there are only two elements in the input sequence (2, 2), so they are combined directly to produce the output value of 9. Similarly, in the third position, there are four elements in the input sequence (0, 0, 2, 2), which are combined using bitwise AND (&) to produce the output value of 7.

In general, the number of elements involved in each combination can be any positive integer greater than or equal to 2, depending on the position of the output sequence. Therefore, the given transformation pattern can be represented by a single regular expression: `\b(0|0|2)\b`

Solution:
[0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
