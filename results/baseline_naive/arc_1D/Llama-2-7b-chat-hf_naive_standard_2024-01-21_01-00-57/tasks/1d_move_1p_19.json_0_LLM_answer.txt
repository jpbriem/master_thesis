LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position j in the output sequence should also be equal to 0. If the value at position i in the input sequence is not equal to 0, then the value at position j in the output sequence should be equal to the value at position i in the input sequence modulo 2.

For example, in the first test case, the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the corresponding output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. As you can see, all non-zero values in the input sequence have been transformed into zero values in the output sequence, except for the last two elements which have been transformed correctly according to the rule.

In general, this type of transformation pattern can be used to implement various types of bitwise operations, such as XOR, AND, OR, etc.
