LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:

LLM answer:

output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is a sequence of 1s and 0s. Each row represents a single bit in the binary representation of an integer. For example, the first row contains three 1s, which correspond to the bits 111 in the binary representation of 5. Similarly, the second row contains two 1s and one 0, which correspond to the bits 101 in the binary representation of 3.

The output is also a sequence of 1s and 0s, but with each element shifted by one position compared to the input. This means that the first element in the output corresponds to the second bit in the input, the second element in the output corresponds to the third bit in the input, and so on.

For example, in the first input, the first element is 1, which corresponds to the second bit in the binary representation of 5 (01). In the output, this element is shifted to the second position, so it becomes 0 (the value of the second bit in the binary representation of 5). Similarly, the second element in the input is 1, which corresponds to the third bit in the binary representation of 5 (10), and in the output it becomes 1 (the value of the third bit in the binary representation of 5).

This process continues for all elements in both the input and output sequences, resulting in a transformed output sequence where each element is shifted by one position compared to the corresponding element in the input sequence.
