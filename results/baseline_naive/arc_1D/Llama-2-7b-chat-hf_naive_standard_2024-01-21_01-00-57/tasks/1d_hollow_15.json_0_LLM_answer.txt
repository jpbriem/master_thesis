LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of two parts:

Part 1: Replace each element with a random value between 0 and 7 (inclusive).

Part 2: If the number of elements is odd, replace the last element with 0.

For example, in Example_1, the input array has 9 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 7 (resulting in an output array with the same distribution as the input array). Since the number of elements is odd (9), Part 2 replaces the last element (the 8th element) with 0, resulting in the output array.

Similarly, in Example_2, the input array has 10 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 7 (resulting in an output array with the same distribution as the input array). Since the number of elements is even (10), Part 2 does not modify the last element, resulting in the output array.

In Example_3, the input array has 8 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 2 (resulting in an output array with a different distribution than the input array). Since the number of elements is even (8), Part 2 does not modify the last element, resulting in the output array.

Finally, in Test case, the input array has 10 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 4 (resulting in an output array with a different distribution than the input array). Since the number of elements is odd (10), Part 2 replaces the last element (the 10th element) with 0, resulting in the output array.
