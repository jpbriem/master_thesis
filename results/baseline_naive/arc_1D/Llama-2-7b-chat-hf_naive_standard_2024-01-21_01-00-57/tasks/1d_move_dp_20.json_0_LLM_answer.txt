LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is a sequence of 8 numbers. Each number in the sequence is either 0 or 7. The first occurrence of each number in the sequence is followed by exactly one occurrence of the corresponding number. For example, the first occurrence of 0 is followed by exactly one occurrence of 7, and so on.

The output is also a sequence of 8 numbers, where each number represents the position of the corresponding number in the original input sequence. In other words, the output sequence starts with 0 at index 0, then has 7 at index 1, and so on.

Note that this problem can be solved using dynamic programming, which is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.
