LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher, where each bit in the input is replaced by a fixed number of bits to the right (or left) according to a specific rule. In this case, each bit in the input is shifted three positions to the right (or left), so that the first bit becomes the third bit, the second bit becomes the sixth bit, and so on. This process repeats for all bits in the input until the end of the sequence is reached.

For example, in the input "0000000000", the first bit is zero, so it remains unchanged. The second bit is also zero, so it becomes the third bit in the output "0000000000". The third bit is one, so it becomes the sixth bit in the output "0000000000". And so on.

In summary, the given transformation pattern can be described as a simple substitution cipher that shifts each bit in the input three positions to the right (or left).
