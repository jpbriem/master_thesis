LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to certain patterns. Here are the rules for this particular pattern:

1. If an element is 0, it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence).
2. If any other element is encountered, it is replaced by the next occurrence of 0 from the input sequence (if there is one). If there is no such occurrence, the element remains unchanged.

By applying these rules repeatedly to the input sequence, we obtain the corresponding output sequence. Note that the resulting output sequence may have some elements repeated multiple times, which is why the length of the output sequence may be different from the length of the input sequence.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
