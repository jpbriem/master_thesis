LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the output sequence is calculated as the result of an AND operation between its corresponding element in the input sequence and a binary string of length equal to the number of bits used for each element in the output sequence (i.e., 4 bits). For example, the first element in the output sequence is obtained by performing an AND operation between the first two elements in the input sequence, then shifting the resulting binary string left by 4 positions, and repeating this process until all elements in the output sequence have been computed.

Solution:
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
