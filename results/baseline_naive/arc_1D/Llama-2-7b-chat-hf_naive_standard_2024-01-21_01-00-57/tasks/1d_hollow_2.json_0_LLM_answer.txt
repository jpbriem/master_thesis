LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of integers (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k.

For example, in Example_1, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also equal to 0. Similarly, the second rule is (5, 5), which means that if the value at position 5 in the input sequence is equal to 5, then the value at position 5 in the output sequence is also equal to 5.

In Example_2, the first rule is (0, 0), which is the same as in Example_1. The second rule is (5, 0), which means that if the value at position 5 in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also equal to 0.

In Example_3, the first rule is (0, 0), which is the same as in Examples_1 and 2. The second rule is (6, 0), which means that if the value at position 6 in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also equal to 0.

In Test case, the first rule is (0, 0), which is the same as in Examples_1 to 3. The second rule is (3, 0), which means that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is also equal to 0.
