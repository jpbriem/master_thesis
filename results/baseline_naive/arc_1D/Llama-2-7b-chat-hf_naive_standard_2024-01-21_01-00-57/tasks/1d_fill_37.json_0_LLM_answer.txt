LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of bitwise AND operations (i.e., `a & b`) followed by a series of bitwise OR operations (`|`). Specifically, each pair of adjacent elements in the input array is compared using the bitwise AND operation, and if the result is nonzero, it is set to one; otherwise, it remains zero. Then, all elements are combined using the bitwise OR operation.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the first element is compared with the second element using `a & b`, which results in 1 since they are both nonzero. Therefore, the output element is set to 1. Similarly, the second element is compared with the third element using `a & b`, which also results in 1, and so on. Finally, all elements are combined using `|` to produce the final output.

In the second input-output pair, the same sequence of comparisons and transformations occurs, but with different input values. In the third input-output pair, the input values are reversed, but the transformation pattern remains the same.

Finally, for the test case, the input values are [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], which produces the expected output value of [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0].
