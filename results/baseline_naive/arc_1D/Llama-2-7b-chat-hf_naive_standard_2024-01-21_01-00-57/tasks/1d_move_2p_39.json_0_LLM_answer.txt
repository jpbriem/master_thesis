LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is applied to each element in the input sequence, resulting in a transformed sequence. The first rule is to replace any element equal to 0 with 0. The second rule is to replace any element greater than or equal to 2 with twice its value.

For example, for the input sequence [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], the first rule replaces the elements equal to 0 with 0, leaving us with [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]. Then, the second rule replaces the elements greater than or equal to 2 with twice their value, resulting in [0, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 0].

Similarly, for the input sequence [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the first rule replaces the elements equal to 0 with 0, leaving us with [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Then, the second rule replaces the elements greater than or equal to 2 with twice their value, resulting in [0, 0, 4, 8, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In general, the transformation pattern consists of two rules:

1. Replace any element equal to 0 with 0.
2. Replace any element greater than or equal to 2 with twice its value.
