LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i is the position in the input sequence and j is the corresponding position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to 0, then the value at position j in the output sequence should also be equal to 0. If the value at position i in the input sequence is not equal to 0, then the value at position j in the output sequence should be equal to 1.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is [0, 0,..., 0], and the output sequence is [0, 0,..., 0] with all positions having value 0. In Example_2, the input sequence is [0, 0,..., 0], and the output sequence is [0, 0,..., 0] with all positions having value 0 except for position 3, which has value 3. In Example_3, the input sequence is [0, 7,..., 7], and the output sequence is [0, 0,..., 0] with all positions having value 0 except for position 7, which has value 7.

In Test Case, the input sequence is [0, 0,..., 0], and the output sequence is [0, 0,..., 0] with all positions having value 0.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
