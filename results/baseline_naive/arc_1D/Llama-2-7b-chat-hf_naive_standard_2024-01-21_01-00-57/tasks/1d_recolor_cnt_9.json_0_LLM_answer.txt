LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output by applying a series of bitwise AND operations on each element with its neighbors (left, right, top, bottom). The resulting bits are then summed up to produce the final output.

In Example_1, the first row has three elements that are set to 0, so they are not included in the calculation. In Example_2, the second row has three elements that are set to 3, so they are included in the calculation twice. In Example_3, the third row has three elements that are set to 0, so they are not included in the calculation.

For Test case, the input contains only one non-zero element at position 3, which is ANDed with its left and right neighbors to produce the output.
