LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to the following logic:

* If the current element is 0, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence).
* Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 4, then it is replaced by half its value rounded down (truncated) modulo 4.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0], where all elements greater than or equal to 4 are reduced by half and rounded down modulo 4.

Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0], where all elements greater than or equal to 4 are reduced by half and rounded down modulo 4.

In Example_3, the input sequence [0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], where all elements greater than or equal to 4 are reduced by half and rounded down modulo 4.

Finally, in Test case, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0], which demonstrates the correct application of the given transformation pattern.
