LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to the following logic:

* If the current element is zero, it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence).
* Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 2, it is replaced by the next greatest integer (modulo 8) from the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence [0, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this process, the elements 2, 4, and 6 are replaced by their nearest neighbors (modulo 8), which are 2, 4, and 6, respectively.

Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0]. In this process, the elements 3 and 4 are replaced by their nearest neighbors (modulo 4), which are 4 and 0, respectively.

In Example_3, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 5, 0]. In this process, the elements 5 and 6 are replaced by their nearest neighbors (modulo 6), which are 6 and 5, respectively.

Finally, in Test case, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which matches the expected output.
