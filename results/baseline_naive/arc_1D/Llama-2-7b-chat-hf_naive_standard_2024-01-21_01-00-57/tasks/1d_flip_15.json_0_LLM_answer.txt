LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is applied to each element in the input sequence, resulting in a transformed sequence. The first rule is to replace any element greater than or equal to 7 with the corresponding element from the second row (i.e., shift the elements up by one position). If there are no more rows after applying this rule, then apply the second rule, which replaces any element greater than or equal to 6 with the corresponding element from the third row (i.e., shift the elements up by two positions). Repeat these steps until all elements have been replaced, resulting in the final output sequence.

Solution:
[0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
