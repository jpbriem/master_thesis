LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to the following logic:

* If the current element is zero, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence).
* Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 3, then it is replaced by the previous element (i.e., the element that comes before it in the input sequence).

For example, in the first input sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], the element at position 0 remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence), while all other elements are replaced by the previous element (i.e., the element that comes before it in the input sequence). Similarly, in the second input sequence [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], all elements except the last one are replaced by the previous element, resulting in the output sequence [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6].

In general, this transformation pattern can be applied repeatedly to any input sequence, resulting in a new output sequence where each element is either zero or the previous element.
