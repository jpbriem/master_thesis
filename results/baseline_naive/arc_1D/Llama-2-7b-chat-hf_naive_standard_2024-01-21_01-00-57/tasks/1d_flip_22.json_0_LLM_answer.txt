LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to the following logic:

* If the current element is 0, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes part of the output sequence).
* Otherwise, if the current element is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 7, then it is replaced by the next element from the output sequence (modulo 8).

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this example, all elements greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 7 are replaced by the corresponding element from the output sequence (modulo 8), while the remaining elements remain unchanged.

Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this example, all elements greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 7 are replaced by the corresponding element from the output sequence (modulo 8), while the remaining elements remain unchanged.

In Example_3, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]. In this example, all elements greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 7 are replaced by the corresponding element from the output sequence (modulo 8), while the remaining elements remain unchanged.

Finally, in Test case, the input sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0] is transformed into the output sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0].
