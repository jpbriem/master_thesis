LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between each pair of adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the output sequence is calculated as the result of these bitwise AND operations.

For example, in Example_1, the first two elements in the input sequence are 0 and 0, respectively. When these two elements are combined using a bitwise AND operation, the result is also 0. Similarly, the next six elements in the input sequence are all 0, so when they are combined using bitwise AND operations, the resulting output sequence consists only of 0s.

In Example_2, the first three elements in the input sequence are 0, 0, and 6, respectively. When these elements are combined using bitwise AND operations, the resulting output sequence consists of alternating 0s and 6s.

In Example_3, the first element in the input sequence is 5, which is combined with the subsequent elements to produce an output sequence consisting solely of 5s.
