LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to certain patterns. Here are the rules for this specific pattern:

1. If the current element is 0, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes the output element).
2. If the current element is not 0, then it is replaced by the next even number from the right (modulo 8) minus 4. For example, if the current element is 7, then its replacement value is 3 (since 7 modulo 8 = 3).
3. If there are no more elements after applying rule 2, then the remaining elements in the input sequence are repeated until all elements have been transformed.

By applying these rules repeatedly to the input sequence, we obtain the output sequence shown above.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]
