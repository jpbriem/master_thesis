LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i is the position in the input sequence and j is the corresponding position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k+1. If the value at position i is not equal to k, then the value at position j is equal to 0.

For example, in Example_1, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is 1. The second rule is (3, 3), which means that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is 3, then the value at position 3 in the output sequence is 4. And so on.

In Example_2, the first rule is (0, 3), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 3 in the output sequence is 3. The second rule is (3, 6), which means that if the value at position 3 in the input sequence is 3, then the value at position 6 in the output sequence is 7. And so on.

In Example_3, the first rule is (0, 0), which means that if the value at position 0 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is 0. The second rule is (7, 0), which means that if the value at position 7 in the input sequence is 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is 7. And so on.

In Test case, the first rule is (5, 5), which means that if the value at position 5 in the input sequence is 5, then the value at position 5 in the output sequence is 5. The second rule is (5, 0), which means that if the value at position 5 in the input sequence is not equal to 0, then the value at position 0 in the output sequence is 5. And so on.

Solution:
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]
