LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations to each element in the input sequence. Specifically, for each element x in the input sequence, the result of the bitwise AND operation between x and a binary string of length k (where k is the number of elements in the input sequence) is assigned as the corresponding element in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], and the resulting output sequence is [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]. In this example, the bitwise AND operation is applied to each element in the input sequence with a binary string of length 8 (i.e., the number of elements in the input sequence).

In general, the bitwise AND operation can be performed on any two sequences of bits, where the resulting sequence has the same length as the shorter of the two input sequences. The resulting sequence will have all bits set to 0 if both inputs are 0, and will have all bits set to 1 if either input is nonzero.
