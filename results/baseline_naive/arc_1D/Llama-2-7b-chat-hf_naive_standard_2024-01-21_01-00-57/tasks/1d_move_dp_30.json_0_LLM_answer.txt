LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5]

Test case:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k modulo 2. If the value at position i is not equal to k, then the value at position j is equal to 0.
For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by applying the following rules:
* At position 0, the value 0 is replaced by 0.
* At position 1, the value 0 is replaced by 3.
* At position 2, the value 0 is replaced by 3.
* At position 3, the value 0 is replaced by 0.
* At position 4, the value 5 is added to the current value, which is 0, so the new value is 5.
In Example_2, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by applying the following rules:
* At position 0, the value 2 is replaced by 0.
* At position 1, the value 2 is replaced by 2.
* At position 2, the value 2 is replaced by 0.
* At position 3, the value 5 is added to the current value, which is 0, so the new value is 5.
In Example_3, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by applying the following rules:
* At position 0, the value 1 is replaced by 0.
* At position 1, the value 1 is replaced by 1.
* At position 2, the value 1 is replaced by 1.
* At position 3, the value 1 is replaced by 0.
* At position 4, the value 5 is added to the current value, which is 0, so the new value is 5.
