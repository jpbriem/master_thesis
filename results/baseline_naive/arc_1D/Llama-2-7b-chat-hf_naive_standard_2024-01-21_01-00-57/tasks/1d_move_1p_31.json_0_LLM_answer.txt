LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is a sequence of 0s and 1s. Each row represents a single bit in the binary representation of a number. The first column contains the least significant bits (LSB), the second column contains the next most significant bits (MSB), and so on.

For each input, the corresponding output is obtained by applying the same bitwise AND operation to each row of the input matrix. This means that if any element in a particular row is 1, then all elements in that row will be set to 0 in the output matrix. If all elements in a row are 0, then they will remain unchanged in the output matrix.

In Example_1, the input matrix has only one 1 in the third row, which is located in the second position. When this 1 is ANDed with the input matrix, all elements in the third row will be set to 0, leaving only the original value in the second position.

In Example_2, there are six 1s in the second row, which are ANDed with the input matrix to produce an output matrix with no 1s in the second row.

In Example_3, there are three 1s in the first row, which are ANDed with the input matrix to produce an output matrix where all elements in the first row are 0.
