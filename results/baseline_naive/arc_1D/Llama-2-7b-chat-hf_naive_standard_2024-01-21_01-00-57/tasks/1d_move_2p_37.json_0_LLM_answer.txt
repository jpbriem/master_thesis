LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher where each bit in the input is replaced by a corresponding bit in the output based on the modulo operation (mod 4). In other words, if the input bit is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it is replaced by the corresponding odd bit in the output; otherwise, it is left unchanged.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the bits at positions 0 and 3 in the input are both 0, so they remain unchanged in the output. The bits at positions 1 and 2 in the input are both 3, which maps to the bit at position 0 in the output, so the output bit at position 0 is set to 3. Similarly, the bits at positions 4 and 5 in the input are both 3, which maps to the bit at position 1 in the output, so the output bit at position 1 is set to 3. And so on.

In summary, the given transformation pattern can be implemented using a simple substitution cipher that replaces each input bit with an output bit according to a specific mapping based on the modulo operation (mod 4).
