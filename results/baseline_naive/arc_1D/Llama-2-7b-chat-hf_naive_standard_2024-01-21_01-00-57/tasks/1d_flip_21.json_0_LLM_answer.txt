LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as follows:

P = [[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]]

Where P is a matrix of size 8x8, with each element in the matrix representing an operation on a single bit position. The operations are performed according to the following rules:

* If the current bit position is odd (i.e., the index is divisible by 2), then the operation is XOR with the corresponding element in the previous row.
* If the current bit position is even (i.e., the index is not divisible by 2), then the operation is XOR with the corresponding element in the next row.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the bit at position 1 is initially 0, and it becomes 1 after applying the transformation pattern. In the second input-output pair, the bit at position 4 is initially 0, and it becomes 8 after applying the transformation pattern. In the third input-output pair, the bit at position 5 is initially 0, and it becomes 5 after applying the transformation pattern.

Conclusion:
The given transformation pattern can be used to transform a binary sequence of length 8 into another binary sequence of the same length, where each element in the output sequence is obtained by applying a specific operation to the corresponding element in the input sequence, based on the parity of the bit position.
