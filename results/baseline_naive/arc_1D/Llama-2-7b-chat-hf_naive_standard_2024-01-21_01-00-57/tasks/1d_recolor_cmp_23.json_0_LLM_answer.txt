LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that consists of all ones except for one bit that is set to one. The resulting product is then taken modulo 2, which effectively performs a bitwise AND operation. This process continues until no more bits can be set to one in the binary masks. The final result is obtained by taking the least significant bit of each element in the output sequence.

Note: The above examples and test cases demonstrate the transformation pattern, but they may not cover all possible inputs or outputs.
