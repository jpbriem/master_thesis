LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 7s. Each sequence of 7s is followed by a sequence of 0s. The number of 7s in each sequence is equal to the number of 0s. For example, in the first input sequence, there are 3 sequences of 7s (each consisting of 3 7s), followed by 3 sequences of 0s (also each consisting of 3 0s). Similarly, in the second input sequence, there are 4 sequences of 7s (each consisting of 4 7s), followed by 4 sequences of 0s (also each consisting of 4 0s).

In each input sequence, the number of 7s is always equal to the number of 0s. Therefore, if the number of 7s in an input sequence is x, then the number of 0s in that sequence is x.

For each input sequence, the corresponding output sequence has the same number of elements as the input sequence. However, the values of the elements in the output sequence are determined based on the value of the corresponding element in the input sequence. Specifically, if the value of the ith element in the input sequence is x, then the value of the ith element in the output sequence is either 0 or 7, depending on whether x is even or odd, respectively.
