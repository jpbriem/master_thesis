LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of two parts:

Part 1: Replace each element with its nearest neighbor (clockwise) modulo 8. If there is no nearest neighbor, keep the original value.

Part 2: Set all elements to 0 if their index is even, otherwise set them to 7.

For example, in the first input, the element at position 4 is replaced by its nearest neighbor (modulo 8) which is 5, so the output is [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0].

In the second input, the element at position 2 is replaced by its nearest neighbor (modulo 8) which is 1, so the output is [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0].

In the third input, all elements are zeroed out because their indices are even, so the output is [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In the test case, the input is transformed according to the given transformation pattern as follows:
[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0] â†’ [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
