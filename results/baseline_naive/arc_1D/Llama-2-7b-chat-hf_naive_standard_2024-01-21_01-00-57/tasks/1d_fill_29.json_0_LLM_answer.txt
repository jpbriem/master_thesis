LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to k, then the value at position j in the output sequence is equal to k times the number of occurrences of the value 0 in the subsequence of the input sequence from position i to position i+k-1.
For example, in Example_1, the first rule applies to the subsequence [0, 0, 0, 0], which has three occurrences of the value 0. Therefore, the value at position 6 in the output sequence is equal to 6 times 3, or 18. Similarly, the second rule applies to the subsequence [6, 0, 0, 0], which has two occurrences of the value 0. Therefore, the value at position 6 in the output sequence is equal to 6 times 2, or 12.
In Example_2, the first rule applies to the subsequence [0, 0, 0, 6], which has four occurrences of the value 0. Therefore, the value at position 6 in the output sequence is equal to 4 times 6, or 24. Similarly, the second rule applies to the subsequence [6, 0, 0, 0], which has three occurrences of the value 0. Therefore, the value at position 6 in the output sequence is equal to 3 times 6, or 18.
In Example_3, the first rule applies to the subsequence [0, 0, 0, 3], which has two occurrences of the value 0. Therefore, the value at position 3 in the output sequence is equal to 2 times 2, or 4.
In Test case, the first rule applies to the subsequence [0, 2, 0, 0], which has two occurrences of the value 0. Therefore, the value at position 2 in the output sequence is equal to 2 times 2, or 4.
