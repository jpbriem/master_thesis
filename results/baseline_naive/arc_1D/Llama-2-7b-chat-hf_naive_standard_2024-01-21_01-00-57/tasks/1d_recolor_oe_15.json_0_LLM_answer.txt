LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output sequence by applying a series of bitwise AND operations between adjacent elements in the input sequence. Each element in the input sequence is multiplied by a binary mask that consists of ones and zeros. The resulting product is then taken as the new value for each position in the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first two inputs (0 and 0) are multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 1], which results in [0, 0, 1]. Similarly, the third input (3) is multiplied by the binary mask [0, 0, 0], which results in [0, 0, 0]. This process continues until all inputs have been processed, resulting in the final output sequence [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].

In general, the transformation pattern can be described as follows:

* For each position i in the input sequence, take the corresponding element xi from the input sequence.
* Multiply xi by a binary mask bi, where bi is a sequence of ones and zeros.
* Take the result of this multiplication as the new value for position i in the output sequence.

By repeating this process for each position in the input sequence, we obtain the final output sequence.
