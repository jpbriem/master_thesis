LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher that replaces each element with a fixed number of positions down the array (in this case, 5). This means that if an element is at position i in the input array, it will be at position i + 5 in the output array.

For example, in the first input array, the element at position 0 is replaced by the element at position 5 (since position 0 + 5 = position 5), and so on. Similarly, in the second input array, the element at position 0 is replaced by the element at position 7 (since position 0 + 7 = position 7), and so on.

In the third input array, all elements are replaced by the corresponding element 2 positions down the array (i.e., the element at position i is replaced by the element at position i - 2). In the test case, all elements are replaced by the corresponding element 7 positions down the array (i.e., the element at position i is replaced by the element at position i - 7).

Solution:
[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
