LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher where each bit in the input is replaced by a corresponding bit in the output based on the modulo operation (mod 4). In other words, if the input bit is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it is replaced by the corresponding odd bit in the output; otherwise, it is left unchanged.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the bits at positions 0 and 3 in the input are both 0, so they remain unchanged in the output. The bits at positions 1, 2, and 4 in the input are all odd, so they are replaced by 3 in the output. Similarly, in the second input-output pair, all the bits in the input are replaced by their corresponding bits in the output based on the modulo operation (mod 4).

In the third input-output pair, the bits at positions 0 and 1 in the input are both 0, so they remain unchanged in the output. The bits at positions 2, 3, and 4 in the input are all odd, so they are replaced by 1 in the output. Finally, in the test case, all the bits in the input are replaced by their corresponding bits in the output based on the modulo operation (mod 4).
