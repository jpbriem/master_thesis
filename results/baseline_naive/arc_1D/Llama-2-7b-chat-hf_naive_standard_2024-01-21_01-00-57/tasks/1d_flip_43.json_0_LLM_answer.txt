LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform an input sequence into an output sequence. Each rule is defined by a pair of indices (i, j), where i represents the position in the input sequence and j represents the position in the output sequence. The rule states that if the value at position i in the input sequence is equal to the value at position j in the output sequence, then the value at position i+1 in the input sequence should be moved to position j+1 in the output sequence. If the value at position i in the input sequence is not equal to the value at position j in the output sequence, then no action is taken.

For example, in Example_1, the first input value is 0, which becomes the second output value (position 2). The next input value is also 0, which remains unchanged in the output sequence (position 3). The third input value is 2, which moves from position 3 to position 4 in the output sequence. Similarly, the fourth input value is 4, which moves from position 4 to position 5 in the output sequence. And so on.

In Example_2, the first input value is 0, which becomes the second output value (position 7). The next input value is also 0, which remains unchanged in the output sequence (position 8). The third input value is 4, which moves from position 8 to position 9 in the output sequence. Similarly, the fifth input value is 7, which moves from position 9 to position 10 in the output sequence. And so on.

In Example_3, the first input value is 0, which becomes the second output value (position 7). The next input value is 5, which moves from position 7 to position 12 in the output sequence. The seventh input value is 7, which moves from position 12 to position 13 in the output sequence. And so on.

In Test case, the input values are [0, 0, 0, 1, 2], which become the output values [0, 0, 0, 2, 2].
