LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to certain patterns. Here are the rules for this specific pattern:

1. If the current element is 0, then it remains unchanged (i.e., it becomes the output element).
2. If the current element is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5, then it is multiplied by 3 and added to its previous value (modulo 9). This rule applies only if the current element is not 0.
3. If the current element is 9, then it becomes 0.
4. If the current element is 0, then it becomes the next element in the input sequence.

By applying these rules repeatedly to the input sequence, we obtain the corresponding output sequence.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
