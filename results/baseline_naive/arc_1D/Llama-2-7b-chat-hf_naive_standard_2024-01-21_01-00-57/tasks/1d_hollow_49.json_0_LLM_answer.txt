LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher where each bit in the input is replaced by a corresponding bit in the output based on the modulo operation (mod 8). For example, if the input is [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], the first bit is 0, so it remains unchanged; the second bit is 5, which becomes 0 when divided by 8, so it changes to 0; the third bit is also 5, which becomes 0, so it changes to 0; and so on. Similarly, for the output, the first bit is 0, so it remains unchanged; the second bit is 0, so it remains unchanged; and so on.

Therefore, the given transformation pattern can be represented as follows:

f(x) = x % 8

where f(x) represents the output of the transformation pattern, and x represents the input.

[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
