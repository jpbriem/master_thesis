LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of two parts:

Part 1: Replace each element with a random value between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

Part 2: If the number of elements is odd, add 9 to the last element.

For example, in Example_1, the input array has 8 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 9 (resulting in [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 5, 5]). Since the number of elements is even, there is no modification in Part 2.

In Example_2, the input array has 9 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 9 (resulting in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7]). Since the number of elements is odd, adding 9 to the last element results in the output array ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]).

In Example_3, the input array has 8 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 9 (resulting in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1]). Since the number of elements is even, there is no modification in Part 2.

Finally, for Test case, the input array has 9 elements, so Part 1 replaces each element with a random value between 0 and 9 (resulting in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9]). Since the number of elements is odd, adding 9 to the last element results in the output array ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 9, 0]).
