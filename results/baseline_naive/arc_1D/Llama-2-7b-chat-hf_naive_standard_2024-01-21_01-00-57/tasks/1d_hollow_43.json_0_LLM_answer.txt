LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a simple substitution cipher, where each element in the input sequence is replaced by a corresponding element in the output sequence, based on the modulo of their indices (modulo 2). For example, the first element in the input sequence is replaced by the second element in the output sequence (since they have the same index), the second element in the input sequence is replaced by the third element in the output sequence (since they have different indices but are still in the same group), and so on. This process continues until all elements in the input sequence have been replaced by corresponding elements in the output sequence.

Solution:
[5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
