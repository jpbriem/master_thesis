LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is a sequence of numbers with alternating values of 0 and 4. The output also consists of alternating values of 0 and 4, but with some adjustments to maintain the pattern. In each step, if there are any leading zeros in the input, they are removed before applying the transformation. If there are any trailing zeros in the input, they are added after applying the transformation.

For example, in the first step, the input is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] after removing the leading zeros. In the second step, the output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] after adding the trailing zeros.

In general, the transformation pattern can be described as follows:

* Remove all leading zeros from the input.
* Apply the bitwise AND operation (&) to the remaining bits, shifting them left by one position.
* Add all trailing zeros to the result of the previous step.

By repeating this process, we get the final output sequence consisting of alternating values of 0 and 4.

Solution:
[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
