LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 6s. Each sequence of 6s is followed by a sequence of 0s. The length of each sequence can vary, but the overall pattern remains the same.

In Example_1, the input sequence has a length of 10 elements, with 6 elements in each sequence (except for the last two elements, which are 0). The output sequence also has a length of 10 elements, with all elements equal to 6.

In Example_2, the input sequence has a length of 8 elements, with 3 elements in each sequence (except for the last two elements, which are 0). The output sequence also has a length of 8 elements, with all elements equal to 3.

In Example_3, the input sequence has a length of 9 elements, with 4 elements in each sequence (except for the last element, which is 0). The output sequence also has a length of 9 elements, with all elements equal to 4.

In the test case, the input sequence has a length of 9 elements, with 7 elements in each sequence (except for the last two elements, which are 0). The output sequence also has a length of 9 elements, with all elements equal to 7.
