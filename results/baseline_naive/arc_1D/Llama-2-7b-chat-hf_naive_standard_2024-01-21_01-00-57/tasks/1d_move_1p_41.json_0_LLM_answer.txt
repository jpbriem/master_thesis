LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 2s. Each sequence of 2s is followed by a sequence of 0s. The length of each sequence of 2s is equal to the number of elements in the input array.

For example, in the first input array, there are 8 elements, and each sequence of 2s has length 4 (i.e., 2*4 = 8). Similarly, in the second input array, there are 6 elements, and each sequence of 2s has length 3 (i.e., 2*3 = 6).

In each output array, every element that was originally 2 becomes 0, and every element that was originally 0 remains unchanged. This means that the output arrays have the same structure as the input arrays, but with all the elements changed to 0 or 2 according to the given transformation pattern.

Solution:
[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
