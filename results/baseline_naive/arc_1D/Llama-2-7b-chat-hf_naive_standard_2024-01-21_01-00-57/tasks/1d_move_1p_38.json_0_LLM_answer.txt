LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 4s. Each sequence of 4s is followed by a sequence of 0s. The length of each sequence can vary, but the overall pattern remains the same.

In Example_1, the input sequence has a length of 9, with 4 consecutive sequences of 4 elements each, separated by 5 elements that are all 0. The output sequence also has a length of 9, with the same alternating pattern of 0s and 4s as the input.

In Example_2, the input sequence has a length of 8, with 4 consecutive sequences of 4 elements each, separated by 4 elements that are all 0. The output sequence has a length of 8, again with the same alternating pattern of 0s and 4s as the input.

In Example_3, the input sequence has a length of 6, with 3 consecutive sequences of 3 elements each, separated by 3 elements that are all 0. The output sequence has a length of 6, with the same alternating pattern of 0s and 3s as the input.

In Test Case, the input sequence has a length of 9, with 7 consecutive sequences of 7 elements each, separated by 2 elements that are both 0. The output sequence has a length of 9, with the same alternating pattern of 0s and 7s as the input.
