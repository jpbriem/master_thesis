LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]

LLM answer:

output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be expressed as a simple substitution of values in the output sequence based on their positions in the input sequence. Specifically, each value in the input sequence is replaced by its corresponding value in the output sequence, modulo 2. For example, in the first position of the input sequence, the value 0 is replaced by the value 3 in the output sequence (modulo 2 = 1), and so on. Therefore, the output sequence is obtained by cyclically shifting the input sequence by one position to the right, and replacing each value with its corresponding value in the output sequence modulo 2.
