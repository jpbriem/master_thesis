LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern consists of a series of alternating 0s and 2s. Each sequence of 2s is replaced by the next sequence of 2s in the original input sequence. For example, the first occurrence of [2, 2] in the input sequence becomes [4, 4] in the output sequence because the second 2 in the input sequence corresponds to the third 2 in the output sequence. Similarly, the second occurrence of [2, 2] in the input sequence becomes [6, 6] in the output sequence because the third 2 in the input sequence corresponds to the fourth 2 in the output sequence. This process continues until all occurrences of [2, 2] in the input sequence have been replaced by their corresponding sequences in the output sequence.
