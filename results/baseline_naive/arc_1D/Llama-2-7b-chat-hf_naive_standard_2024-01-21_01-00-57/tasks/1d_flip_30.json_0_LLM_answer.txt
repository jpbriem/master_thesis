LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be represented as a set of rules that transform each element in the input sequence according to certain patterns. Here are the rules for this particular pattern:

* If the current element is 0, then the next element is also 0.
* If the current element is not 0, then it is multiplied by 2 before being passed to the next rule.
* If the result of the previous rule is 7 or more, then it is reduced by 1 modulo 7.
* If the result of any previous rule is less than or equal to 6, then it remains unchanged.

By applying these rules repeatedly to the input sequence, we obtain the output sequence shown above.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0, 0]
