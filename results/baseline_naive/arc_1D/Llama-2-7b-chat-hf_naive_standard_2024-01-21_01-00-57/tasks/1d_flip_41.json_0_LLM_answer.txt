LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into an output of the same length by applying a series of bitwise AND operations on each element with its neighbors to the left and right. In this example, the number of bits in each element is fixed at 4, so the resulting elements will always have 4 bits.

For Example_1, the first element is ANDed with the second element, which results in a value of 0 since both elements are 0. Then, the third element is ANDed with the fourth element, which also results in a value of 0 since both elements are 0. This process continues until all elements have been ANDed with their neighboring elements, resulting in the final output.

For Example_2, the first element is ANDed with the fifth element, which results in a value of 5 since the first element is 1 and the fifth element is 5. Then, the sixth element is ANDed with the seventh element, which results in a value of 1 since the sixth element is 0 and the seventh element is 1. This process continues until all elements have been ANDed with their neighboring elements, resulting in the final output.

For Example_3, the first element is ANDed with the eighth element, which results in a value of 0 since both elements are 0. Then, the second element is ANDed with the ninth element, which also results in a value of 0 since both elements are 0. This process continues until all elements have been ANDed with their neighboring elements, resulting in the final output.

In Test Case, the input is transformed into the expected output using the same transformation pattern as the other examples.
