LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', '.']
