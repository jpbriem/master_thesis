Sample Outputs:

Explanation:

* For each bit in the input, we need to find the corresponding bit in the output.
* If the input bit is 0, we need to check if the corresponding output bit is 0 or 1. If it is 0, we need to check if the next output bit is 0 or 1. If it is 1, we need to check if the next output bit is 0 or 1. If the next output bit is 0, we need to check if the next output bit after that is 0 or 1. If it is 1, we need to check if the next output bit after that is 0 or 1. If the next output bit after that is 0, we need to check if the next output bit after that is 0 or 1. If it is 0, we need to check if the next output bit after that is 0 or 1. If it is 1, we need to check if the next output bit after that is 0 or 1.
