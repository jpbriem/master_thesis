output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Explanation:

* For each bit in the input, we need to find the corresponding bit in the output.
* If the input bit is 0, the corresponding output bit is also 0.
* If the input bit is 1, the corresponding output bit is the same as the input bit.
* The output bits are read from right to left.
