Explanation:

* For each bit in the input, we need to find the corresponding bit in the output.
* If the bit in the input is 0, the corresponding bit in the output is also 0.
* If the bit in the input is 1, the corresponding bit in the output is the same as the number of 1s to the left of the current bit in the input.
