Explanation:
In the first step, we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 3. We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.

For example, in the first test case, the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 3 is 7, which is the maximum value seen so far.

In the second step, we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 4. We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.

For example, in the second test case, the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 4 is 7, which is the maximum value seen so far.

In the third step, we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 5. We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.

For example, in the third test case, the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 5 is 7, which is the maximum value seen so far.

Finally, we return the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 3, 4, or 5. In this case, the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 3 is 7, which is the maximum value seen so far. Therefore, the output of the function is [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0].</s>
