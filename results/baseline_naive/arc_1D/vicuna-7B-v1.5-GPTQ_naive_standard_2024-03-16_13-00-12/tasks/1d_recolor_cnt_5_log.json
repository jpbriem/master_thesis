and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.\nWe start by setting the maximum sum to 0 and then for each element in the array, we add the maximum sum seen so far to the current element.\nWe then update the maximum sum seen so far to be the maximum of the current element and the maximum sum seen so far.\nWe repeat this process for each element in the array.\n\nFor the input [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 3 is 1.\nWe can then use this maximum sum to create the output array by adding the maximum sum to each element in the input array.\n\nFor example, the first element in the input array is 0, so we add 1 to it to get 1.\nThe second element in the input array is 0, so we add 1 to it to get 1.\nThe third element in the input array is 0, so we add 1 to it to get 1.\nThe fourth element in the input array is 2, so we add 1 to it to get 3.\nAnd so on.\n\nWe repeat this process for each element in the input array to create the output array.\n\nIn the end, the output array is [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,
