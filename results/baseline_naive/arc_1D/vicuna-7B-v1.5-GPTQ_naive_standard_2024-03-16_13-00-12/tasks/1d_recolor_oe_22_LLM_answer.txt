Explanation:
In the first step, we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size 3.
We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.
For example, in the first test case, the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of size 3 is 7 (5 + 5 + 0 = 15), so we move on to the next test case.
