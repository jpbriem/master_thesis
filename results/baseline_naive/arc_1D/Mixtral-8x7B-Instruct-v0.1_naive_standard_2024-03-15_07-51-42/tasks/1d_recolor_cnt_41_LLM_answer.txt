You can use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. The idea is that for each element in the array, we look at all elements within a certain range of it and calculate how many zeros are there before the first non-zero number. Then we update our answer accordingly. Here is an example implementation using Python:

```
def mergeZeros(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize result with same values as input
    res = [-1]*n
    i = j = k = 0
    while j < n:
        if arr[j] == 0:
            j += 1
            continue
        else:
            # Find index 'k' such that sum(arr[i..k]) equals sum(arr[j..n-1])
            while i <= j:
                s = sum(arr[i:j+1]) - sum(arr[:k+1])
                if s == 0:
                    break
                elif s > 0:
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    k += 1
            res[i:j+1] = [k + 1]*(j-i+1)
            i = j + 1
            j = i
    return res
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input array. This is because for every zero in the input array, we need to iterate through all other numbers until we find one which has the correct sum. However, since the input array only contains two distinct integers, we can optimize this algorithm by precomputing the prefix sums of the array. With this optimization, the time complexity becomes O(N).

Here is the optimized version:

```
def mergeZerosOptimized(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Precompute prefix sums
    psum = [0]
    for x in arr:
        psum.append(psum[-1] + x)

    # Initialize result with same values as input
    res = [-1]*n
    i = j = k = 0
    while j < n:
        if arr[j] == 0:
            j += 1
            continue
        else:
            # Find index 'k' such that sum(arr[i..k]) equals sum(arr[j..n-1])
            target = psum[j:] - psum[n] + psum[i-1]
            while i <= j:
                s = psum[j] - psum[i]
                if s == target:
                    break
                elif s > target:
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    i += 1
            res[i:j+1] = [i - 1]*(j-i+1)
            i = j + 1
            j = i
    return res
```

This function works similarly to the previous one but instead of calculating the sum of `arr[i..j]` explicitly, we subtract the prefix sums of `arr[0..i-1]` from those of `arr[0..j]`. This allows us to avoid iterating over the entire range `[i..j]`, thus reducing the time complexity significantly.
