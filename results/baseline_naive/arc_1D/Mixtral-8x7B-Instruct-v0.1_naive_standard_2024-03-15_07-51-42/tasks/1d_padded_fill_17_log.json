Please post your code and explain what's not working.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nYou can use `itertools.groupby()` to group the consecutive numbers together then replace them with their sum if they are equal to `n`. Here is an example for `n=3`:\n\n```\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef fill(numbers):\n    return ''.join(''.join(str(sum(g)) if k == n else g[0][0] * len(list(g))\n                   for k, g in groupby(numbers)) for n in set(numbers))\n\nprint(fill(\"0003000000030000000300000003\")) # \"00033333333333333333\"\n```\n\nThis solution works by first creating a list of groups where each group contains all the consecutive numbers that are equal. Then it replaces these groups with either the number itself or its sum depending on whether this number equals `n` or not. Finally, it joins everything back into one string.\n\n**Note:** This solution assumes that there will be no negative numbers in the input. If there could be negative numbers as well, simply change the condition from `k == n` to `k >= 0 and k == n`.\n\nComment: Thank you very much! I was trying to solve it using loops but couldn't get anywhere near close to this elegant solution."
