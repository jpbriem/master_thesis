If so, you replace all of them with that value. Here's an example implementation using Python:\n\n```\ndef expand(lst):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lst):\n        j = i + 1\n        val = lst[i]\n        while j < len(lst) and not lst[j]:\n            j += 1\n        if j - i > 1:\n            lst[i+1 : j] = [val] * (j - i - 1)\n        i = j\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n- We initialize two pointers `i` and `j`. The former points at the current index we want to process, whereas the latter points at the first element after this one which is either zero or out of bounds.\n- At each iteration, we look up the value stored at position `i`, then move forward until we find a non-zero element or reach the end of the array.\n- If the distance between `i` and `j` is greater than one, it means that we found some zeros in between. In this case, we fill these positions with copies of the last non-zero value we encountered.\n- Finally, we update our pointer `i` to point at the new location where we left off.\n\nHere's how you would call this function on your examples:\n\n```\n>>> expand([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0])\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n>>> expand([0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> expand([8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nAs pointed out by @user5965026, this solution has quadratic time complexity because of the nested loops. To fix this issue, we need to keep track of the start and end indices of each sequence of consecutive zeros separately. This way, when we encounter another sequence of zeros, we only have to compare its length against the previous ones instead of scanning through their contents again. Here's an updated version of the code implementing this idea:\n\n```\ndef expand(lst):\n    # Initialize empty stack containing tuples of form (start, end).\n    stack = []\n\n    # Keep track of the current sequence of zeros.\n    seq_start = None\n    seq_end = None\n\n    # Iterate over input list.\n    for i, x in enumerate(lst):\n        if x == 0:\n            if seq_start is None:\n                seq_start = i\n            seq_end = i\n        else:\n            if seq_start is not None:\n                stack.append((seq_start, seq_end))\n                seq_start = None\n                seq_end = None\n\n    # Handle final sequence of zeros.\n    if seq_start is not None:\n        stack.append((seq_start, seq_end))\n\n    # Expand sequences of zeros.\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(stack):\n        s, e = stack[i]\n        n = e - s + 1\n        v = lst[e]\n        lst[s:e+1] = [v] * n\n        i += 1\n\n    return lst\n```\n\nThe main difference here is that we now maintain a separate data structure (a stack) to store the ranges of zeros we encounter during the scan. When we hit a non-zero element, we push the range onto the stack. Afterwards, whenever we see another sequence of zeros, we just pop the topmost entry from the stack and extend it accordingly.\n\nHere's how you would call this function on your examples:\n\n```\n>>> expand([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0])\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n>>> expand([0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> expand([8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nComment: I think this will be O(n^2), since you do a linear pass through the list every time you find a group of zeros. It might be better to build a list of groups of zeros and then go back and fill those groups with the appropriate number.\n\nComment: You're right, thanks for pointing that out! I added a more efficient version based on your suggestion.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI am assuming that the numbers are integers.\n\nIf they were strings, you could simply split the string into substrings consisting of alternating runs of digits and zeros, and join them together. For example, in python:\n\n```\nimport re\n\ndef expand(x):\n    return ''.join(re.findall('(\\d+|0*)', str(x)))\n```\n\nBut since they are integers, you cannot directly apply regular expressions."
