## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last index where you found an element that matches your target value and then check if there are any elements between this index and the current one that also match the target value. If so, we know that all these values must be part of the same group as the first one. We update our start index accordingly and continue iterating until we reach the end of the array or find another group. Here's how it looks like in code:

```
def removeZeros(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    i = j = 0
    while j < n:
        # Find next non-zero number
        while arr[j] == 0 and j < n - 1:
            j += 1

        # Check if we have reached the end of the array
        if j >= n:
            break

        # Update the result with the new group
        k = j
        while arr[k]!= 0 and k < n:
            k += 1
        res[i : i + (k - j)] = arr[j : k]

        # Move on to the next group
        i += (k - j)
        j = k

    return res[:i]
```

This solution has time complexity \$O(n)\$, since each element is processed exactly once. It uses space proportional to the size of the input array due to the copying at the end. This could be avoided by modifying the original array instead but I assumed that was not allowed based on your question.

**Edit:** As pointed out by @user5965026, the above implementation does not work correctly when the zeros appear before the first group of numbers. To fix this issue, simply initialize `i` to `-1`.

Comment: Nice answer! But what about the test case `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]`, which should give `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]`?

Comment: You're right, thanks for pointing that out. That's easily fixed though. Just need to change the initialization of `i` to `-1`.

## Answer (1)

Here's my attempt using Python.

The basic idea is to scan from left to right, keeping track of the indices of the beginning and ending of the current sequence of non-zeros. When encountering a zero, replace it with the previous non-zero value. Then move the pointer forward until reaching the next non-zero value.

```
def removeZeros(arr):
    """
    Given an integer array A containing N integers, you need to remove all
    occurrences of '0'. After removing the zeros, the remaining elements will
    be moved left to fill the empty spaces. Return the resulting array.
