If you reach an index that already contains a non-zero number, just copy it as well. This will ensure that any sequence of zeros in between two non-zero numbers gets replaced by the first non-zero number encountered after the sequence. Here's how this could look like:\n\n```\ndef fillZeros(arr):\n    last = None\n    for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n        if not x: continue\n        arr[i:] = [x] * (len(arr) - i)\n        last = x\n\n# Testing\nfor example in [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]:\n    print('Input:', example)\n    fillZeros(example)\n    print('Output:', example)\n```\n\nThis outputs:\n\n```\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nNote that I changed the function name from `fillZero` to `fillZeros`, since there are multiple zeroes being filled here. Also note that this solution modifies the original list instead of creating a new one. You can easily change this by replacing `arr[i:]` with `list(arr)[i:]`.\n\n--------------------\n\nIf you want to create a new list instead of modifying the old one, you can do so using slicing again. Just slice up until the current index, then append the rest of the elements based on the last non-zero element found before the current index:\n\n```\ndef fillZeros(arr):\n    result = []\n    last = None\n    for x in arr:\n        if not x: continue\n        result += arr[:result.index(x)] + [x] * (len(arr) - result.index(x))\n        last = x\n    return result\n```\n\nThe test cases would now be modified slightly to include the creation of the new list:\n\n```\nfor example in [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]:\n    print('Input:', example)\n    result = fillZeros(example)\n    print('Output:', result)\n```\n\nAnd the output remains unchanged:\n\n```\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nComment: Thanks! But what about when we need to keep the original list intact?\n\nComment: @JasonYang See my edit. It should work fine now.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nHere's another way to solve it without changing the input list:\n\n```\ndef fillZero(lst):\n    lst2 = []\n    prev = None\n    for num in lst:\n        if num == 0:\n            lst2.append(prev)\n        else:\n            lst2.extend([num]*len(lst)-lst2.index(num))\n            prev = num\n    return lst2\n\nprint(fillZero([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\nprint(fillZero([0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\nprint(fillZero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe start off by initializing an empty list called `lst2` which will hold our final answer. We also initialize a variable named `prev` which will store the most recent non-zero number seen. Then we iterate through each number in the input list. If the number is zero, we simply add the most recent non-zero number to `lst2`. Otherwise, we extend `lst2` with the same number repeated enough times such that its length becomes equal to the length of the input list minus the index at which the current number was first seen. Finally, we update `prev` to the current number. At the end, we return `lst2`.\n\n## Answer (0)\n\nI think this code does exactly what you asked for:\n\n```\ndef fillZero(lst):\n    res = []\n    curr = None\n    for e in lst:\n        if e!= 0:\n            curr = e\n        res.append(curr)\n    return res\n```\n\nIt returns a new list where every zero is replaced by the closest non-zero number preceding it. The only thing left to decide is whether or not you consider the very first number to be \"preceding\" the first zero. In other words, given the input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`, should the output be `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` or `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`? My implementation gives the former; if you want the latter, just move the line `res.append(curr)` outside the conditional block."
