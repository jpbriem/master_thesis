You just need to keep track of the last non-zero element and its value. If you encounter another non-zero element that has a different value than the previous one, then replace all elements between them with zeroes. Here's an example implementation in Python:\n\n```\ndef remove_zeros(numbers):\n    if not numbers or len(numbers) == 1:\n        return numbers\n\n    prev = None\n    val = None\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(numbers):\n        if numbers[i]!= 0:\n            if prev is not None and numbers[prev]!= numbers[i]:\n                j = min(prev + 1, i)\n                while j < i:\n                    numbers[j] = 0\n                    j += 1\n            prev = i\n            val = numbers[i]\n        i += 1\n\n    return numbers\n\nprint(remove_zeros([2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # => [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(remove_zeros([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0])) # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0]\nprint(remove_zeros([0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # => [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(remove_zeros([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0])) # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over the array once from left to right. It keeps track of the index of the last non-zero element seen so far (`prev`) as well as its value (`val`). When it encounters a new non-zero element, it checks whether it has already encountered a non-zero element before and whether their values are equal. If they aren't, it replaces all elements between the two non-zero elements with zeros. This way we ensure that there will be no more than one sequence of consecutive identical non-zero elements at any point in time.\n\nThe reason why I added some extra conditions like checking whether `prev` is set or not is because otherwise the first non-zero element would always get replaced with zeros since there wouldn't have been any previous non-zero element yet. The same applies to the very end of the list where we don't want to check against the next element anymore but rather compare the current element with the last non-zero element instead.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
