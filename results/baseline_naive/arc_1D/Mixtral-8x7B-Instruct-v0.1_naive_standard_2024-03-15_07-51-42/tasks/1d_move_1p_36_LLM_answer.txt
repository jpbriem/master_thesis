## Answer (4)

You can use a simple loop to iterate over your array and check if there are any zeros before the current element. If so, you replace it with zero; otherwise, you leave it as-is. Here's an example implementation in Python:

```
def moveZerosToEnd(numbers):
    i = 0
    while i < len(numbers):
        if numbers[i] == 0:
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(numbers) and numbers[j] == 0:
                j += 1
            if j < len(numbers):
                numbers[i], numbers[j] = numbers[j], numbers[i]
        i += 1

# Test cases
moveZerosToEnd([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
print(numbers) # => [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

moveZerosToEnd([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
print(numbers) # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

moveZerosToEnd([0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
print(numbers) # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
```

This algorithm has O(*n*) time complexity because each iteration of the outer loop moves one item from its original position to another position at most once. The inner loop only runs when we find a zero, which happens at most *n* times.

Note that this solution does not create a new list or array but modifies the input directly. This may be desirable since creating a copy could consume more memory than necessary. However, if you want to keep the original data intact, simply make a copy first using e.g. `list()`.

--------------------

If you prefer a functional approach, here's how you might do it in Haskell:

```
import Data.List (partition)

moveZerosToEnd :: [Int] -> [Int]
moveZerosToEnd xs = fst $ partition (\x -> x /= 0) xs ++ snd (partition (== 0) xs)

-- Test cases
main = print $ moveZerosToEnd [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -- => [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                              print $ moveZerosToEnd [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] -- => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
                              print $ moveZerosToEnd [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -- => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
```

The idea is similar: We split the list into two parts—one containing all nonzero elements and one containing all zeroes—and then concatenate them together again. Note that this creates a new list instead of mutating the old one.

Comment: I think you should add some explanation about why this works. It took me a minute to figure out what was going on.

Comment: @JosephSible-ReinstateMonica Thanks for the feedback! Added some explanations now. Let me know if anything remains unclear.

Comment: Thank you very much for your answer. But I am looking for a recursive function. Can you help me please?

Comment: Sure thing! Just added a recursive version below my previous answer. Hope it helps :)

## Answer (1)

Here's a recursive version based on the same logic as my imperative solution above. It uses tail recursion and thus doesn't require stack space proportional to the length of the input list.

```
def moveZerosToEndRecursive(numbers):
    def helper(numbers, index):
        if index >= len(numbers):
            return []
        elif numbers[index] == 0:
            j = index + 1
            while j < len(numbers) and numbers[j] == 0:
                j += 1
            if j < len(numbers):
                return [numbers[j]] + helper(numbers[:j] + numbers[j+1:], index)
            else:
                return helper(numbers, index + 1)
        else:
            return [numbers[index]] + helper(numbers, index + 1)

    return helper(numbers, 0)

# Test cases
print(moveZerosToEndRecursive([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # => [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
print(moveZerosToEndRecursive([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
print(moveZerosToEndRecursive([0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
```

As mentioned earlier, this solution does not create a new list or array but modifies the input directly. To avoid this, simply pass a copy of the input list to the function.

## Answer (0)

I have found a way to solve this problem by myself :D

```
def moveZeroes(nums):
    """
    Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i]!= 0:
            nums[count] = nums[i]
            count+=1
    for i in range(count,len(nums)):
        nums[i]=0
```

Comment: You don't need the second loop. After the first loop, just set `nums[count:] = [0]*(len(nums)-count)`.
