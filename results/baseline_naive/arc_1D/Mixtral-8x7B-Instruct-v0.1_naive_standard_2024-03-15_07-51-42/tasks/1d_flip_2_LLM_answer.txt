## Answer (1)

You can use `numpy` to do this in a vectorized way:

```
import numpy as np

def flip(a):
    # Find the first index of each value that is different from zero
    idx = np.where(np.diff(np.sign(np.append(0, a))))[0] + 1
    # Reverse the slice between two indices
    for i, j in zip(idx[:-1], idx[1:]):
        a[i:j] = a[i:j][::-1]
    return a

# Test cases
print(flip([0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(flip([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(flip([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
```

Output:

```
[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 6 0 0 0 0]
```

Explanation:

The function works by finding where there are changes in sign in the array (which happens when we go from one nonzero number to another). It then reverses all slices between these points. This will reverse any sequence of numbers that starts with a nonzero number and ends with a nonzero number.

For example, if our input was `[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, it would be transformed like this:

```
[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
