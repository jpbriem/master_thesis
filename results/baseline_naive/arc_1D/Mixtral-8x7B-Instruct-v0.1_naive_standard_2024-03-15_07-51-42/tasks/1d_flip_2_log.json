Please post your code and explain what's not working.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nYou can use `numpy` to do this in a vectorized way:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef flip(a):\n    # Find the first index of each value that is different from zero\n    idx = np.where(np.diff(np.sign(np.append(0, a))))[0] + 1\n    # Reverse the slice between two indices\n    for i, j in zip(idx[:-1], idx[1:]):\n        a[i:j] = a[i:j][::-1]\n    return a\n\n# Test cases\nprint(flip([0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(flip([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(flip([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 6 0 0 0 0]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe function works by finding where there are changes in sign in the array (which happens when we go from one nonzero number to another). It then reverses all slices between these points. This will reverse any sequence of numbers that starts with a nonzero number and ends with a nonzero number.\n\nFor example, if our input was `[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, it would be transformed like this:\n\n```\n[0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 4, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, "
