## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last time you saw a non-zero value and then check if that was within your current window size or not. If it wasn't, then we know there must be at least one zero in between so we need to fill all those zeros with ones. Here's how this could look like implemented in Python:

```
def expand(a):
    n = len(a)
    i = j = ans = 0
    while j < n:
        # move right until we see a non-zero element
        while j < n and a[j] == 0:
            j += 1
        # now we have seen a non-zero element, let's find out when we first saw it
        k = j - 1
        while k >= 0 and a[k]!= 0:
            k -= 1
        # our new window starts from here
        start = k + 1
        # and ends where we are currently looking
        end = j
        # if the distance between these two indices is larger than the window size
        # then we need to fill everything in between with ones
        if end - start > w:
            ans[start : end - (end - start - w)] = [1] * (end - start - w)
        # update pointers
        i = j
        j += 1
    return ans
```

This runs in \$O(n)\$ time complexity as well as space complexity since we only ever store the input array plus some additional variables which don't take up much memory.

Here's an example run on your second test case:

```
>>> expand([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
```

And another example run on your third test case:

```
>>> expand([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
```

--------------------

If you want to make sure that the function also works correctly even if the window size is larger than half the length of the list, you can add a simple conditional before filling the missing values with ones:

```
if end - start > w:
    if w <= (end - start) // 2:
        ans[start : end - (end - start - w)] = [1] * (end - start - w)
```

The reason why this is necessary is because otherwise you would overwrite elements that should actually remain zeroes. For example consider what happens if we apply the original solution to the following input:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
```

with a window size of `w=8`. Then after finding the first seven, the algorithm will try to fill the next eight positions with ones but that includes the very first position again which shouldn't be changed! So instead we need to make sure that the window size isn't too large compared to the actual distance between the two indices. This way we avoid changing any elements that shouldn't be changed.

Comment: I think this answer is correct, but I am having trouble understanding the logic behind it. Could you please explain more about the logic behind this code? Thank you.

Comment: @James Sure thing :) Let me edit my post and include a detailed explanation.

Comment: Thanks for the explanation. It makes sense now. However, I just realized that the problem statement says "the width of the window cannot exceed half of the total number of elements". How do I modify the code to account for this condition?

Comment: @James You mean you want to throw an error if someone tries to pass a window size that is too big? Or simply ignore such cases?

Comment: Yes, throwing an error would be ideal. But ignoring such cases would work fine too.

Comment: @James Alright, I added a small modification to the code that ensures that the window size doesn't get too big. That way no errors will occur anymore.

Comment: Great! One final question. Why did you choose to initialize `ans` using `[0]*len(a)` rather than `list(a)`? Is there a specific reason for doing so?

Comment: @James No particular reason other than that I didn't notice that you already initialized `ans` yourself. In general though, initializing it with `[0] * len(a)` has the advantage that it always creates a fresh copy of the list whereas `list(a)` might reuse references to existing objects depending on whether they are mutable or immutable.

Comment: Gotcha. Thanks for explaining. Your help is greatly appreciated.

## Answer (1)

I believe this does exactly what you asked for.

```
def expand(lst, w):
    lst = list(lst)
    result = []
    index = 0
    while True:
        if index+w > len(lst):
            break
        elif sum(lst[index:index+w]) == w:
            result += lst[index:index+w]
        else:
            result += [1]*(w-(sum(lst[index:index+w])))
            result += lst[index:index+w]
        index += w
    return result
```

It iterates through the list in chunks of `w`, checks if the chunk contains all 1s, and if not fills the rest of the chunk with 1s.

**Edit:** As pointed out by @MSeifert, this method is O(N^2), which may cause performance issues for long lists.

Comment: Note that this is quadratic time complexity (because of the repeated slicing).

Comment: Ah yes, good point. I hadn't considered that. I'll leave this answer up anyway, maybe it will still be useful to somebody.

Comment: Well... it _is_ a valid solution, although probably slower than the accepted one. And sometimes slow solutions are easier to understand/implement.
