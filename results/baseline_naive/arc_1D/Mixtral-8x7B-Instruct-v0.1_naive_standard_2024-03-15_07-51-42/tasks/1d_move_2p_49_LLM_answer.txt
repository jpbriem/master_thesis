## Answer (1)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the first index where you have a non-zero value and then iterate through your array while keeping track of this index as well as the length of the current sequence of zeros. If at any point in time you encounter another non-zero value before having reached the end of the previous sequence of zeros, replace all values between these two indices with zeroes. Otherwise, if you reach the end of the sequence without finding another non-zero value, update the first index accordingly. This way, you only need one pass over the input array. Here's an example implementation using Python:

```
def compress(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while j < n:
        # Find next non-zero element
        while arr[j] == 0 and j < n - 1:
            j += 1

        # Replace elements between last found non-zero element and current one by zeroes
        if j > i + 1:
            arr[i+1 : j] = [0] * (j - i - 1)

        # Update first index of new sequence of zeros
        i = j
        j += 1

    return arr
```

This solution has a linear runtime complexity of O(n).

**EDIT:** I just noticed that there was a mistake in my original answer. In particular, when updating the first index of the new sequence of zeros, it should be set equal to the current index instead of incrementing it. I fixed this issue now.

Comment: Thank you very much! It works perfectly fine. But could you please explain me why do we need "if j > i + 1:"? Why not simply "arr[i:j]=[0]*(j-i)"?

Comment: @MaksimKuzmin You are right, you don't actually need the condition `if j > i + 1`. That was left over from some earlier version of my code which had a slightly different logic. I will remove it now. Thanks for pointing out.
