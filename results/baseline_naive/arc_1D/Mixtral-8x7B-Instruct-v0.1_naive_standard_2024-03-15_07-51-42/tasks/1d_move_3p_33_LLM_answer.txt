## Answer (4)

You can use a simple loop to iterate over your array and replace all zeroes with the value of the previous non-zero element. If you reach an index that already contains a non-zero number, just copy it as well. This will ensure that any sequence of zeros in between two non-zero numbers gets replaced by the first non-zero number encountered after the sequence. Here's how this could look like:

```
def fillZeros(arr):
    last = None
    for i, x in enumerate(arr):
        if not x: continue
        arr[i:] = [x] * (len(arr) - i)
        last = x

# Testing
for example in [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]:
    print('Input:', example)
    fillZeros(example)
    print('Output:', example)
```

This outputs:

```
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
Input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Note that I changed the function name from `fillZero` to `fillZeros`, since there are multiple zeroes being filled here. Also note that this solution modifies the original list instead of creating a new one. You can easily change this by replacing `arr[i:]` with `list(arr)[i:]`.

--------------------

If you want to create a new list instead of modifying the old one, you can do so using slicing again. Just slice up until the current index, then append the rest of the elements based on the last non-zero element found before the current index:

```
def fillZeros(arr):
    result = []
    last = None
    for x in arr:
        if not x: continue
        result += arr[:result.index(x)] + [x] * (len(arr) - result.index(x))
        last = x
    return result
```

The test cases would now be modified slightly to include the creation of the new list:

```
for example in [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]:
    print('Input:', example)
    result = fillZeros(example)
    print('Output:', result)
```

And the output remains unchanged:

```
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
Input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Comment: Thanks! But what about when we need to keep the original list intact?

Comment: @JasonYang See my edit. It should work fine now.

## Answer (1)

Here's another way to solve it without changing the input list:

```
def fillZero(lst):
    lst2 = []
    prev = None
    for num in lst:
        if num == 0:
            lst2.append(prev)
        else:
            lst2.extend([num]*len(lst)-lst2.index(num))
            prev = num
    return lst2

print(fillZero([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
print(fillZero([0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
print(fillZero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])) # -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Explanation:**

We start off by initializing an empty list called `lst2` which will hold our final answer. We also initialize a variable named `prev` which will store the most recent non-zero number seen. Then we iterate through each number in the input list. If the number is zero, we simply add the most recent non-zero number to `lst2`. Otherwise, we extend `lst2` with the same number repeated enough times such that its length becomes equal to the length of the input list minus the index at which the current number was first seen. Finally, we update `prev` to the current number. At the end, we return `lst2`.

I think this code does exactly what you asked for:

```
def fillZero(lst):
    res = []
    curr = None
    for e in lst:
        if e!= 0:
            curr = e
        res.append(curr)
    return res
```

It returns a new list where every zero is replaced by the closest non-zero number preceding it. The only thing left to decide is whether or not you consider the very first number to be "preceding" the first zero. In other words, given the input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`, should the output be `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` or `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]`? My implementation gives the former; if you want the latter, just move the line `res.append(curr)` outside the conditional block.
