The idea is to keep track of the last index where you found an element that was not zero and then check if there are any non-zero elements in the next indices until you reach the end or find another zero. If so, replace all those values with the value at the first position. Here's how it would look like:\n\n```\ndef fix(arr):\n    start = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        # Find the first non-zero element after'start'.\n        j = start + 1\n        while j < len(arr) and arr[j] == 0:\n            j += 1\n        start = j\n\n        # Check if we have reached the end or found a zero.\n        if j >= len(arr) or arr[j] == 0:\n            break\n\n        # Replace all the non-zero elements between'start' and 'j' with the\n        # value at'start'.\n        k = start\n        while k < j:\n            arr[k] = arr[start]\n            k += 1\n\n        i = j\n\n# Test cases.\nprint(fix([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(fix([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(fix([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(fix([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\n**Note**: This solution assumes that the input list will always contain at least one zero. Otherwise, the function should return the original array as is.\n\n--------------------\n\nAnother way to do this is by using two pointers. One pointer moves from left to right looking for the first non-zero element. Once such an element is found, the second pointer starts moving from right to left replacing all the non-zero elements before reaching the first zero encountered by the first pointer. Here's how it would look like:\n\n```\ndef fix(arr):\n    # Move the first pointer from left to right.\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr) and arr[i] == 0:\n        i += 1\n\n    # Base case.\n    if i >= len(arr):\n        return arr\n\n    # Move the second pointer from right to left.\n    j = len(arr) - 1\n    while j > i and arr[j]!= 0:\n        j -= 1\n\n    # Replace all the non-zero elements between 'i' and 'j' with the\n    # value at 'i'.\n    while i <= j:\n        arr[i] = arr[j]\n        i += 1\n        j -= 1\n\n    return arr\n\n# Test cases.\nprint(fix([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(fix([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(fix([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\nprint(fix([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nComment: I think your answer is correct but could you please explain what does \"sliding window\" mean here?\n\nComment: @AyushGupta Sure! A sliding window is basically a fixed size subarray/sublist that slides through the entire array/list. In this problem, our window has variable length since its size depends on the number of consecutive zeros at the beginning of the array. We move the window forward whenever we encounter a non-zero element. When the window moves, we copy the value at the current head of the window into all the positions inside the window except the tail. Hope that helps :)\n\nComment: Thanks, now I got it. But why did you choose this method over other methods? Is it more efficient than others?\n\nComment: @AyushGupta Yes, it is more efficient because it only requires a single pass through the array. Other solutions might require multiple passes which makes them less efficient. For example, one possible solution is to iterate backwards through the array starting from the end and replace every non-zero element with the previous non-zero element. However, this solution doesn't work when there are no non-zero elements towards the end of the array. To handle this edge case, you need to add additional logic which increases complexity. So, overall, my solution is simpler and faster.\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/215695/discussion-between-ayush-gupta-and-heemayl).\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nHere is a simple recursive solution. It works by finding the first non-zero integer, and then recursively calling itself on the rest of the list.\n\n```\ndef f(lst):\n    try:\n        idx = lst.index(next(x for x in lst if x))\n    except StopIteration:\n        return lst\n    else:\n        return [lst[idx]] + f(lst[:idx]) + f(lst[idx+1:])\n\n>>> f([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> f([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> f([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> f([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI am assuming that the sequence ends with a zero. You can just loop through the sequence once and update the sequence accordingly.\n\n```\ndef func(seq):\n    prev = None\n    for i in range(len(seq)):\n        if seq[i]==0:\n            continue\n        elif prev is None:\n            prev = seq[i]\n        else:\n            seq[:i] = [prev]*i\n            prev = seq[i]\n    seq[:len(seq)-1] = [prev]*(len(seq)-1)\n    return seq\n```\n\nThis code snippet returns the following results:\n\n```\nfunc([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n=> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nfunc([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n=> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nfunc([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n=> [0,"
