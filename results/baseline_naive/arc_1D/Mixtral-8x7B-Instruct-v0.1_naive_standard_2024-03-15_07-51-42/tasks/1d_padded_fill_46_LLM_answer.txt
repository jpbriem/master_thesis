## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last seen non-zero value and its index in two variables `last` and `idx`. When you encounter another non-zero value, if it's less than or equal to `last`, then update `last` with this new value and replace all zeros between `idx` and current position with `last`. If not, just update `last` and move on. Here is an implementation using Python:

```
def fill(nums):
    idx = -1
    last = 0
    for i, x in enumerate(nums):
        if x > 0:
            if x <= last:
                nums[idx + 1 : i] = [last] * (i - idx - 1)
            else:
                last = x
            idx = i
    return nums

# Test cases
print(fill([0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(fill([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This solution has time complexity \$O(n)\$, where \$n\$ is the length of the input list.

--------------------

If you want to do this in C++, here is one way to implement it:

```
void fill(vector<int>& nums) {
    int idx = -1;
    int last = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) {
            if (nums[i] <= last) {
                fill(nums.begin() + idx + 1, nums.begin() + i, last);
            } else {
                last = nums[i];
            }
            idx = i;
        }
    }
}
```

The function takes a vector by reference as argument and modifies it directly. It uses the same logic as above but instead of replacing elements manually, we call `std::fill` from the standard library to perform the replacement. This saves us some lines of code but at the cost of having to include the header file `<algorithm>`. Note that I used `size_t` for the loop variable because vectors are usually large enough so that their size cannot be represented by an integer. Also note that since we modify the original vector, there is no need to return anything.

Here is how you could test the function:

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

//... definition of fill goes here...

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v{0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    fill(v);
    for (auto e : v) {
        std::cout << e <<'';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';

    //... more tests go here...

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Comment: Thank you very much! Your answer was really helpful. But I have a question about your python code. In my problem, I should write c++ code. So when I tried to convert your python code into c++ code, I had trouble converting "enumerate" part. Could you give me any advice about this?

Comment: @JaeHyeonKim Sure, I added a C++ version to my answer. Let me know if you have questions about it.

Comment: Wow... thank you very much!! You saved my life :) I will study hard to understand your code well. Have a nice day!
