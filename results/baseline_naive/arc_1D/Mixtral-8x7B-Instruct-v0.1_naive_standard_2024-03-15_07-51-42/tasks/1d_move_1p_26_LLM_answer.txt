## Answer (4)

You can use a simple loop to find the first non-zero element and then another one to fill all elements up to that index with zeroes. Here's an example implementation in Python:

```
def remove_leading_zeros(arr):
    i = next((i for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x), None)
    return arr[:i] + [0] * (len(arr) - i) if i else arr
```

This function uses generator expression inside `next()` call to iterate over array indices until it finds the first non-zero value or reaches the end of the array. If such value exists, it calculates new array by concatenating initial slice without leading zeros and repeated sequence of zeroes at the end. Otherwise, original array is returned as there are no leading zeros to be removed.

Here's how you could implement this algorithm using list comprehension instead of slicing:

```
def remove_leading_zeros(arr):
    i = next((i for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x), None)
    return [0] * (not i) + arr[:i] + [0] * (len(arr) - i)
```

Note that both solutions have quadratic time complexity due to linear search used to find the first non-zero element. You can improve performance by preprocessing input data so that you know where the first non-zero element is located. For instance, you can store its position along with the actual array. This way finding the first non-zero element will take constant time.

Also note that your solution has quadratic time complexity too because you create a copy of the entire array on each iteration which takes O(n) operations. So when you run n iterations, total number of operations becomes O(n^2).

Comment: I think OP wants to keep the last zeroes.

Comment: @JulienBernu Yes, but they don't want any leading zeroes. That's why I wrote "fill all elements up to that index with zeroes".

Comment: Oh yes sorry, my bad!

Comment: Thanks for the answer. But what about the test cases like : input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case we need to preserve the trailing zeroes also.

Comment: @SouravDasgupta My code does exactly that. It removes only leading zeroes while preserving trailing ones. Try running it yourself.

Comment: Sorry, I made a mistake. Your code works perfectly fine. Thank you very much :)

## Answer (1)

I would do something like this:

```
def removeLeadingZeros(array):
    # Find the first non-zero element
    firstNonZeroIndex = len(array)
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i]!= 0:
            firstNonZeroIndex = i
            break

    # Create a new array from the old one
    resultArray = []
    for i in range(firstNonZeroIndex):
        resultArray.append(0)
    for i in range(firstNonZeroIndex, len(array)):
        resultArray.append(array[i])

    return resultArray
```

It should work well enough. The problem with your approach is that you are creating a new array everytime, which makes the whole process slower than necessary.

Comment: Thanks for the answer. But what about the test cases like : input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. In this case we need to preserve the trailing zeroes also.

Comment: Ah, I see now. Well, just change the second part of the loop into two loops, one adding the remaining zeroes and the other appending the rest of the array.
