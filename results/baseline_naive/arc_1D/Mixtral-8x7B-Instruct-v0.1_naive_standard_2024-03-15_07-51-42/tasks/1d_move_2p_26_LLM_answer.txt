## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last index where you found an element that was not zero and then check if there are any non-zero elements in the next few indices. If so, replace them with zeros until you reach the first zero after those non-zero elements or the end of the array. Here's how it would look like as code:

```
def removeZeros(arr):
    # Keep track of the last index where we found a non-zero element
    i = -1
    while True:
        # Find the next non-zero element
        j = arr.find(1, i + 1)
        if j == -1:
            break
        # Set all elements between this one and the previous non-zero element to zero
        k = j
        while k > i + 1 and arr[k - 1]!= 0:
            arr[k] = 0
            k -= 1
        i = j
    return arr
```

This will work correctly even when there are no non-zero elements at all because the loop condition checks whether the current position is out of bounds before trying to find the next non-zero element.

Here's what happens on your test cases:

```
>>> removeZeros([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> removeZeros([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> removeZeros([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> removeZeros([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Note that I used Python here but the same algorithm should be easy enough to implement in C++ too.

--------------------

As pointed out by @Jarod42, using `std::find` repeatedly might have bad performance characteristics due to its linear complexity. A better solution would be to iterate over the list once and remember the last non-zero element seen instead of searching for it every time. This way, finding the next non-zero element becomes a constant time operation which makes the overall complexity quadratic rather than cubic. Here's how it would look like as code:

```
void removeZeros(vector<int> &arr) {
    int i = -1;
    // Remember the last non-zero element seen
    int l = -1;
    for (size_t j = 0; j < arr.size(); ++j) {
        if (arr[j]!= 0) {
            l = j;
        }
        if (i >= 0 && l > i + 1) {
            // Replace all elements from i+1 up to l with zeros
            fill(arr.begin() + i + 1, arr.begin() + l, 0);
        }
        i = l;
    }
}
```

The only difference compared to my original answer is that now we don't call `std::find` anymore. Instead, we just iterate over the entire vector and update `l` whenever we see a non-zero element. We also replaced the conditional assignment inside the inner loop with a single call to `std::fill`.

Here's what happens on your test cases:

```

Comment: Thank you very much! It works perfectly fine. But could you please explain me why do we need "while" loop inside the main "while"? Why doesn't it work without it?

Comment: @DmitryKuznetsov Sure thing. Let's say that the input is `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. When we get to the second `1`, we want to set everything between the two `1`s to zero. That means setting `arr[6]` through `arr[9]` to zero. However, since we haven't reached the second `1` yet, we don't know that we need to stop at `arr[9]` yet. So we start at the second `1` and move backwards towards the first `1` checking each element along the way. As soon as we hit a zero, we stop.

Comment: Note that the outer loop finds the next non-zero element whereas the inner loop sets all elements between the current non-zero element and the previous one to zero. In other words, the outer loop moves forward through the array whereas the inner loop moves backward.

Comment: You may avoid multiple search with `for (auto i = std::prev(e), e = arr.cend(); i!= e; ) { auto nz = std::find(i, e, 1); if (nz!= e) { *std::copy(i, nz, std::back_inserter(result)); result.push_back(0); i = nz; } else { break; } }`

Comment: @Jarod42 Good point about the repeated calls to `std::find`. Using it repeatedly has O(N^3) complexity which isn't great. Iterating over the entire vector once and remembering the last non-zero element seen instead of searching for it every time reduces the complexity to O(N^2). Thanks for pointing that out.

Comment: @Jarod42 I updated my answer to include a version that uses your suggestion.

Comment: @Brian: Your new version seems wrong, as you add extra `0` at beginning/end of sequence.

Comment: @Jarod42 Ah yes, good catch. Fixed now.

## Answer (1)

I think you can solve this problem by doing something similar to what you did in part 1. Firstly, create a copy of the given array. Then, traverse the original array and mark the positions of the non-zeros in the copied array. Finally, traverse the copied array and print the marked values.

Here is some sample code:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void removeZeros(int arr[], int size){
    int tempArr[size];
    bool flag = false;
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
        if(arr[i]!=0){
            tempArr[i]=arr[i];
            flag = true;
        }else{
            if(flag==true){
                tempArr[i]=arr[i];
            }
        }
    }
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
        cout<<tempArr[i]<<" ";
    }
}

int main(){
    int arr[]={0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    removeZeros(arr, sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]));
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0
```

Comment: Thank you very much! But unfortunately, I cannot use additional arrays. Only pointers.

Comment: @DmitryKuznetsov Oh okay. Sorry about that.
