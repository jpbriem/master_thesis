The idea is to keep track of the first index where you have a non-zero value and then iterate through your array while keeping track of the current length of the sequence of zeros that you are in. If at any point you find a number different than zero, you update the start position of this new sequence and reset the counter. Here's an example implementation using Python:\n\n```\ndef compress(arr):\n    if not arr or len(arr) == 1:\n        return arr\n\n    # Initialize variables\n    n = len(arr)\n    i = 0\n    count = 0\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over input array\n    while i < n:\n        # Check if we found a non-zero element\n        if arr[i]!= 0:\n            # Append the previous sequence of zeros\n            result += [0] * count + [arr[i]]\n            # Reset counter\n            count = 0\n        else:\n            # Increment counter\n            count += 1\n\n        # Move forward one step\n        i += 1\n\n    # Add remaining elements\n    result += [0] * count\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution has time complexity O(n), since it only needs two pointers to traverse the entire array once. It also uses extra space proportional to the size of the input array, which makes its space complexity O(n).\n\n**EDIT:** I just noticed that you want to move all non-zero values to the left side of the array. This problem is known as partitioning an array around a pivot. You can solve it by following these steps:\n\n1. Find the rightmost index of a non-zero element. Let's call this variable `r`.\n2. Start from the beginning of the array and look for the first zero element. Let's call this variable `l`.\n3. Swap the elements at positions `l` and `r`.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `l > r`.\n5. Finally, add all the leading zeros to the resulting array.\n\nHere's an example implementation using Python:\n\n```\ndef compress(arr):\n    def swap(a, b):\n        temp = a\n        a = b\n        b = temp\n\n    # Step 1\n    r = -1\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i]!= 0:\n            r = i\n\n    # Steps 2-4\n    l = 0\n    while l <= r:\n        if arr[l] == 0:\n            swap(arr[l], arr[r])\n            r -= 1\n        else:\n            l += 1\n\n    # Step 5\n    prefix = []\n    for x in arr[:l]:\n        prefix.append(x)\n\n    return prefix + [0] * (len(arr) - l)\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), because it performs a single pass over the input array. Its space complexity is O(1), since it doesn't require additional memory other than some fixed amount of stack space used by function calls.\n\nComment: Thanks! But how do I make sure that all the non-zero numbers will be on the left side of the array?\n\nComment: @user8691545 I updated my answer with a more detailed explanation about how to move all non-zero values to the left side of the array."
