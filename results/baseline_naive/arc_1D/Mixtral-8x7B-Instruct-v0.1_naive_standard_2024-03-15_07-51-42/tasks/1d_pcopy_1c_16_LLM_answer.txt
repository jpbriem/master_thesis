## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to iterate over the array and keep track of the indices where you have seen a zero before. If there are no zeros in your current window then you know that this part does not need any changes. Otherwise if there was a zero at index i-k and now we see another one at index j then all elements between these two indices should be set to zero as well. This way you only need to go through the list once and do O(n) work per element which results in an overall complexity of O(n^2). Here's some code demonstrating this:

```
def fillZeros(nums):
    # Keep track of the last time we saw a zero
    prevZero = -1
    n = len(nums)
    # Iterate over the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if we found a new zero
        if nums[i] == 0:
            # Update the previous zero position
            prevZero = i
            continue
        # Now check if we had a zero somewhere earlier
        if prevZero!= -1:
            # Set everything from the old zero up until here to zero
            k = min(prevZero + 1, i)
            while k < i:
                nums[k] = 0
                k += 1
    return nums
```

This will give us the following result:

```
>>> print(fillZeros([0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

As pointed out by @user56700 in the comments below it might make sense to first reverse the input so that we don't have to deal with negative indices when looking backwards. In that case the function would look like this:

```
def fillZeros(nums):
    # Reverse the input
    nums.reverse()
    # Keep track of the next time we expect to see a zero
    nextZero = 0
    n = len(nums)
    # Iterate over the reversed array
    for i in range(n):
        # Get the actual index
        i = n - i - 1
        # Check if we found a new zero
        if nums[i] == 0:
            # Remember that we expect to see a zero again soon
            nextZero = 1
            continue
        # Now check if we had a zero somewhere later
        if nextZero > 0:
            # Set everything from here up until the next zero to zero
            nums[i] = 0
            nextZero -= 1
    return nums
```

The advantage of this version is that we never have to deal with negative indices anymore but instead always just increment or decrement our counters.

Comment: I think using a stack could help reduce the complexity to O(n), since you wouldn't have to loop through every single number after finding a zero. You could simply pop off numbers from the stack until you find a nonzero value, and replace them all with 0.

Comment: That's true but I am not sure how much more complicated the implementation becomes because you also have to take care of pushing back the values onto the stack afterwards. Also note that the OP explicitly asked for a solution without stacks/queues etc.

Comment: Ahh, didn't notice that. Well, maybe they meant something else by "stacks"...but yeah, otherwise I guess this works fine.

Comment: It seems like the questioner has changed their mind about the stack requirement anyway :)

Comment: Yeah, I noticed that too. But still, nice answer!

Comment: Thanks for pointing out the mistake in my original post. I did mean stacks/queues. However, I appreciate your response and I learned something new today. Thank you very much!

Comment: No problem. I added a second version of the algorithm which uses a counter instead of dealing with negative indices. Maybe that makes things easier to understand.

Comment: Yes, thank you! I actually tried implementing the same thing myself yesterday, but couldn't get it right. Your example helped me figure it out. Again, thanks!

## Answer (1)

Here's a simple solution using a queue. We start by initializing a queue containing the positions of all the zeros. Then, we iterate through each position in the array. For each position, we dequeue the front item on the queue. If the difference between the current position and the popped position is greater than 1, we insert all intermediate positions into the queue. Finally, we update the value at the current position based on whether its distance from the popped position is odd or even.

```
from collections import deque

def fillZeros(nums):
    q = deque()
    for i, x in enumerate(nums):
        if x == 0:
            q.append(i)

    for i, x in enumerate(nums):
        if q:
            pos = q.popleft()
            dist = abs(pos - i)
            if dist > 1:
                for j in range(pos+1, i):
                    q.append(j)
            nums[i] = 'x' if dist % 2 else 0

    return nums

print(fillZeros([0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# => [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Comment: Nice solution. Just wanted to point out that the OP specifically mentioned that he doesn't want to use queues though.

Comment: Oh, I missed that. My bad.

Comment: No worries. Still a good solution nonetheless.

Comment: Thanks for your response. I really appreciate it.
