## Answer (1)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last index where you saw a non-zero value and then iterate over your array from that point onwards until you see another non-zero value or reach the end of the array. In each iteration, if the current element is zero, copy it into the result array; otherwise, update the last seen index and continue with the next iteration. If at any time you find two consecutive non-zero values, set their indices as the new start and end points of the window and repeat this process again. Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```
def fill(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    i = j = -1
    res = [-1]*n
    while True:
        # Find first non-zero value after 'j'.
        k = j + 1
        while k < n and arr[k] == 0:
            k += 1
        if k >= n: break
        i, j = k, k
        # Fill zeros between 'i' and 'j'.
        while i > 0 and j < n and arr[i-1] == 0 and arr[j+1] == 0:
            res[i-1], res[j+1] = arr[i-1], arr[j+1]
            i -= 1
            j += 1
    return res
```

Here are some test cases:

```
>>> print(fill([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> print(fill([7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> print(fill([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]))
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]
```

This solution has O(N) complexity because we only perform one pass through the input array.

--------------------

**UPDATE:**

As pointed out by @גלעדברקן, there was an error in my original answer which I have now fixed. Also, here's a more concise version using list comprehension:

```
def fill(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    i = j = -1
    while True:
        k = j + 1
        while k < n and arr[k] == 0:
            k += 1
        if k >= n: break
        i, j = k, k
        res = [x if x!= 0 else y for x,y in zip(arr[i:j:-1], arr[i:j][::-1])]
        arr[i:j] = res[:len(res)//2]
    return arr
```

The above code will modify the input array directly instead of creating a separate result array. This should be faster than the previous implementation since it avoids allocating memory for a new array.

Comment: Nice! You might want to fix the bug when there are no groups of zeros. For example, try `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Comment: Thanks for pointing that out! I've updated my answer accordingly.

Comment: Very nice! I think you can simplify the loop like so: `while i > 0 and j < n and arr[i-1] == 0 and arr[j+1] == 0:`

Comment: Good catch! That does make things simpler indeed. Thank you :)

Comment: It seems to me that the OP wants to replace all zeros between two non-zeros with those non-zeros. So, for example, given `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, they expect `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Your function returns `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Comment: Ahh yes, thank you for bringing this up. I misunderstood the problem statement earlier but I believe I've corrected it now.

Comment: Great job! I would suggest returning `res` rather than modifying `arr` in place.

Comment: Yes, I agree. Modifying the input array in place may not always be desirable depending on the context. I'll add a note about this in my answer.

Comment: Hi guys, thanks for helping me out. I am sorry for the confusion caused due to my poor explanation. I just edited the question and added examples. Hopefully, it makes sense now.

Comment: No worries, I'm glad I could help. I've updated my answer based on your latest edit. Let me know if anything remains unclear.

Comment: Wow, this looks great. I tried running it on python compiler and it works perfectly fine. However, I need to write this algorithm in C++. Can you please guide me on how to convert this to cpp?

Comment: Sure thing! Most of the logic should translate pretty much directly to C++. Just remember to declare variables before assigning them and also change the way you access elements in lists/arrays. Instead of `arr[i]`, you would do `arr[i-1]` in C++ since arrays are 0-indexed. Other than that, everything else should work similarly.

Comment: Okay, got it. One more thing, what does `zip()` do in python? Is there something similar in CPP?

Comment: `zip()` takes multiple sequences as arguments and returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each sequence together. There isn't really a direct equivalent in C++ but you can achieve the same effect using nested loops. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16589868/c-equivalent-of-pythons-enumerate-and-zip-functions for details.

Comment: Got it. Thanks a lot for your help. Really appreciate it.

I don't understand why you say "the number of times the group appears". But assuming you mean the *value* of the group, here's a simple recursive solution:

```
def f(a, s=None, p=-1, r=[]):
  if s is None:
      s = {}
  if not a:
      return r
  v = a[0]
  if v:
      r.append(v)
      return f(a[1:], s, p, r)
  elif p in s:
      r[-1] = s[p]
  else:
      s[p] = r
