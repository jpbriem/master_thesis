## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last zero and its index in an array. If you encounter another zero then update the index with the current one. When you reach a non-zero number check if it's less than or equal to the value at the previous index. If so replace that element with the new number and move the index forward. Otherwise just add the new number to the end of the array. This way you only need to iterate through the list once. Here's some sample code:

```
def fix(numbers):
    zeros = [] #array to store all the zeros we find
    i = -1 #index of the most recent zero
    for j, num in enumerate(numbers):
        if num == 0:
            zeros.append((i, num)) #add the zero to our array
            i = j #update the index
        elif len(zeros) > 0 and numbers[zeros[-1][0]] >= num:
            numbers[zeros[-1][0]] = num #replace the old zero with the new number
            del zeros[-1] #remove the entry from our array
    return numbers
```

Here are your test cases:

```
print(fix([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
#prints [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(fix([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
#prints [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

print(fix([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
#prints [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

print(fix([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
#prints [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Comment: I think this solution will fail on input like `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. It should be changed to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, but instead it returns `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`.

Comment: @MateenUlhaq You're right! Thanks for pointing that out. I fixed my answer by adding a line to remove entries from the array when they no longer matter.

## Answer (1)

I would do something like this:

```
def fix(lst):
    lst = list(lst)
    start = None
    for i, x in enumerate(lst):
        if x!= 0:
            if start is not None:
                for j in range(start, i):
                    if lst[j] < x:
                        lst[j] = x
            start = i
    return lst
```

This function works as follows:

- First, make a copy of the original list.
- Then, loop over each item in the list.
- Whenever you see a non-zero number, look backwards until you find a zero. Replace every number between them with the non-zero number.
- Keep track of where the last non-zero was found.

The time complexity is O(*n*), since you have to visit every single element exactly twice.

## Answer (0)

A simple solution using two pointers technique :

```
def fix(arr):
    n=len(arr)
    left=0
    while left<n and arr[left]==0:
        left+=1
    right=left+1
    while right<n:
        if arr[right]<arr[left]:
            arr[left]=arr[right]
            while left>0 and arr[left-1]>=arr[left]:
                arr[left-1],arr[left]=arr[left],arr[left-1]
                left-=1
        else:
            left+=1
            right+=1
    return arr
```

**Explanation:**

We first initialize two pointer *left* and *right*. We increment *left* till we get a non-zero element. Now we compare elements pointed by *left* and *right*. If the element pointed by *right* is smaller than the element pointed by *left*, we swap both the elements and shift *left* towards left side till we get an element which is greater than the element pointed by *left*. After swapping, we again compare the elements pointed by *left* and *right*. If the element pointed by *right* is still smaller than the element pointed by *left*, we repeat the above process. Else, we simply increment *left* and *right* by 1.

Time Complexity : O(N)

Space Complexity : O(1)
