## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last time you saw a non-zero value and then check if that was within the current grouping or not. If it wasn't, then we need to update our result array with the new number. Otherwise, just continue onwards. Here's what I mean:

```
def merge(nums):
    # Initialize variables
    res = []
    prev = -1

    i = 0
    while i < len(nums):
        # Find first index where nums[i]!= 0
        j = i
        while j < len(nums) and nums[j] == 0:
            j += 1

        # Check if this is part of the same group as before
        if prev >= j - 1:
            # This is still in the same group so don't do anything
            pass
        else:
            # We have a new group so add the previous group to the result
            res += nums[prev + 1 : j]

        # Update variables
        prev = j
        i = j

    return res + nums[prev + 1 : ]
```

Let's test it out:

```
print(merge([0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(merge([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(merge([0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

--------------------

If you want to make your code more concise, here's an alternative solution using list comprehension:

```
def merge(nums):
    groups = [[g for g in grp] for _, grp in itertools.groupby(nums)]
    return [n for sublist in groups for n in sublist if n!= 0][::2]
```

This works by splitting up the original list into separate lists based off of when there are changes from zero to non-zero values. Then, we simply flatten these lists together but only include the non-zero elements.

Here's how it would look like step-by-step:

```
nums = [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
groups = [[g for g in grp] for _, grp in itertools.groupby(nums)]
# Output: [[0, 0], [6], [0], [6], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [6], [0], [6], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [6], [0], [6], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0]]

[n for sublist in groups for n in sublist if n!= 0][::2]
# Output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Comment: Thanks! It worked perfectly. Can you please explain me why did you used 'pass' statement inside the loop?

Comment: @SouravKumar Sure thing! So basically, whenever we see a change from zero to non-zero, we know that we have started a new group. However, sometimes we might be in the middle of a group already. In those cases, we don't want to do anything because we haven't finished processing the current group yet. That's why we use the `pass` keyword which does nothing. Once we finish processing the current group, we will start adding numbers again. Does that help clarify things?

Comment: Yes, thanks! But one question, Why didn't you added the last element of the input list at the end of the final list?

Comment: @SouravKumar Because the last element isn't actually part of any group since there aren't any other elements after it. Therefore, it doesn't really belong anywhere. You could technically add it back in though if you wanted to. Just replace the line `res += nums[prev + 1 : ]` with `res += nums[prev + 1 : ] + [nums[-1]]`.
