Please post your code and explain what's not working.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nYou can use `numpy` to do this in a vectorized way:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef move(arr):\n    arr = np.array(arr)\n    left = np.where(np.diff(arr)!= 0)[0] + 1\n    right = np.where(np.flip(np.diff(np.flip(arr)))!= 0)[0] + 1\n    return np.insert(arr[left], np.cumsum(right), arr[:np.min(right)]).tolist()\n\nmove([0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n# => [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n\nmove([0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n# => [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nmove([0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n# => [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n\nmove([0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n# => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n```\n\nThe idea is that we first find the indices of where the array changes from one value to another using `np.diff`. We then add 1 to these indices since they are zero-indexed. This gives us the index at which each group starts. For example, for the input `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `np.diff` will give us `[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -14, -14, -14, 6, 6, 6]`, and adding 1 gives us `[7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. These are the indices at which the groups start.\n\nWe also need to know where the groups end. To get this information, we flip the array, take its difference, and then flip it back again. The result is an array with the same shape as our original array but with the values reversed. So if our original array was `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the flipped array would be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6]`. Taking the difference gives us `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -6, -6, -6]`, and flipping again gives us `[-6, -6, -6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]`. Now we just need to find the indices where this array differs from zero. Using `np.where` on this array gives us `[0, 29, 30, 31]`. Since we want the *indices* of the elements that differ from zero rather than their values, we pass `True` instead of `0` or `1` as the second argument to `np.where`.\n\nNow all we need to do is insert the beginning of each group into the new array at the appropriate place. We can do this by concatenating the beginning of each group with the rest of the array after removing the beginning of each group. In other words, we want to create the following array:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]\n ^^^^^^^^                                               ^^^^^^^^\nbeginning of first group                              beginning of second group\n\n[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n                                                      ^^^^^^^^\n                                                     everything else\n```\n\nTo do this, we first extract the beginning of each group using slicing:\n\n```\n>>> arr[left]\n[0, 6, 0]\n```\n\nThen we remove the beginning of each group from the original array using slicing:\n\n```\n>>> arr[np.max(left):]\n[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\n\nFinally, we concatenate them together using `np.concatenate`:\n\n```\n>>> np.concatenate((arr[left], arr[np.max(left):]))\narray([ 0,  6,  0,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,\n        6,  6,  6,  0,  0,  0,  0])\n```\n\nThis works fine except that there might be some extra zeros at the beginning of the array. We don't want those, so we use `np.insert` to insert the beginning of each group at the correct position:\n\n```\n>>> np.insert(arr[left], np.cumsum(right))\narray([ 0,  0,  0,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  6,\n        6,  6,  6,  6,  6,  0,  0])\n```\n\nSince we want the output as a list, we convert the resulting array back to a list using `tolist`.\n\n## Answer (0)\n\nHere is my solution:\n\n```\ndef move(lst):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lst)-1:\n        if lst[i] == 0 and lst[i+1]!= 0:\n            j = i+1\n            while j < len(lst) and lst[j]!= 0:\n                j += 1\n            lst[i:j] = [0]*len(lst[i:j])\n            i = j\n        elif lst[i]!= 0 and lst[i+1] == 0:\n            j = i+1\n            while j < len(lst) and lst[j] == 0:\n                j += 1\n            lst[i:j] = [lst[i]]*(j-i)\n            i = j\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return lst\n```\n\nIt iterates through the list until it finds two consecutive numbers that meet the condition. Then it replaces the sublist between them with either zeros or copies of the number found before the zeros depending on whether the first number is zero or not. It does this repeatedly until no more such pairs exist."
