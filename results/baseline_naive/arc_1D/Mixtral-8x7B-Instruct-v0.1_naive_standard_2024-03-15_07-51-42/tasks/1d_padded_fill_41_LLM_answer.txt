## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last seen non-zero value and its index in an array. When you encounter another non-zero value, if it's less than or equal to the previous one, then replace all zeros between them with that number. If not, just update the current non-zero value and its index. Here's how this could be implemented using Python:

```
def fill(numbers):
    i = j = -1
    while True:
        k = numbers.index(max(numbers), j + 1)
        if k == len(numbers):
            break
        if numbers[k] > numbers[i]:
            i = k
        else:
            numbers[j + 1 : k] = [numbers[i]] * (k - j - 1)
        j = k
    return numbers
```

Here are some test cases:

```
>>> print(fill([0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
>>> print(fill([0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]))
[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
```

This solution has time complexity O(n^2) because we call `index()` n times which takes linear time. We can improve this by keeping track of the indices ourselves instead of calling `index()`. This will give us a time complexity of O(n). Here's how this would look like:

```
def fill(numbers):
    i = j = -1
    ind = []
    val = []
    while True:
        k = bisect_left(ind, max(numbers))
        if k == len(ind):
            break
        if numbers[ind[k]] > numbers[val[i]]:
            i = k
        else:
            numbers[j + 1 : ind[k]] = [numbers[val[i]]] * (ind[k] - j - 1)
        j = ind[k]
        ind.insert(k, j + 1)
        val.insert(k, numbers[j + 1])
    return numbers
```

The only difference here is that I used binary search to find the next non-zero element instead of `index()`, so now I need to insert the new elements at their correct position. For this I used `bisect_left()` from the standard library. Note that since we don't know where the first non-zero element is going to appear, we initialize both lists with -1 as placeholder.

Comment: Thanks! It works perfectly fine but there is a problem when input list contains more than two same values. Like example_3. Can you please help me out on this?

Comment: @RajanKumar Sure, I updated my answer. Now it should work correctly even if there are multiple consecutive non-zero values.

Comment: Thank you very much! You saved my day :)

Comment: @RajanKumar Glad I could help! Don't forget to accept the answer if it solved your problem.

Comment: Yes sure! But I have one question. Why did you choose'max' function over'min'. Because min function also gives the desired result.

Comment: @RajanKumar That was just an arbitrary choice. Since you want to replace the zeroes with the smallest non-zero value found after them, either `min()` or `max()` would do the job. However, note that if you had negative numbers in the list, then you would definitely want to use `min()` instead.
