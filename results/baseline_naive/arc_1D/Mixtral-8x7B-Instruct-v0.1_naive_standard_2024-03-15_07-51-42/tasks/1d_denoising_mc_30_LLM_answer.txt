Comment: What is the expected output for `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`?

## Answer (1)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the current subarray and its maximum value. If you find an element that is greater than the current max, then update the max and reset the start index of the subarray. Otherwise, if the difference between the current element and the max is less or equal to k, move forward the end index of the subarray. This way, when you reach the end of the array, the subarray will be the longest one with elements not exceeding the max by more than k. Here's how it looks like in code:

```
def fix(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    ans = [-1]*n
    i = j = 0
    mx = arr[i]
    while j < n:
        if arr[j] <= mx + k:
            ans[j] = mx
            j += 1
        else:
            mx = arr[j]
            i = j
    return ans
```

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input list.

**Update:** I just noticed that your examples are wrong. For example, in the first test case, there should be no change because all numbers are already within k from each other. In the second test case, the correct answer would be `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. And so on... So please make sure that you understand what exactly do you want to achieve before posting questions here.

Comment: Thank you very much! Yes, my bad about the examples. They were incorrect. Your solution works perfectly fine.
