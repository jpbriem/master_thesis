## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last time you saw a non-zero value and if that was less than or equal to the current index minus the size of your window then it's safe to replace all zeros in this range with the next non-zero number. Here's how I would implement it:

```
def fill(numbers):
    start = -1
    i = 0
    while i < len(numbers):
        # If we see a zero at the beginning of our window, update the start position
        if numbers[i] == 0:
            start = i
        elif start!= -1:
            # Replace all zeros from'start' up until 'i' with the first non-zero number after'start'
            j = start + 1
            while j <= i and numbers[j] == 0:
                numbers[j] = numbers[i]
                j += 1
            start = -1
        i += 1
    return numbers
```

Here are some test cases:

```
>>> print(fill([0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]))
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
>>> print(fill([0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]))
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
>>> print(fill([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> print(fill([7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Comment: This solution works perfectly fine but could you please explain me what does "window" mean here?

Comment: @AkshayHazari Sure! In this context, a window refers to a contiguous subsequence of elements within an array/list. For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, one possible window might be `[2, 3, 4]`. Another way to think about windows is as a moving subarray where the starting index increases by one each iteration. So, using the same list above, the first window would be `[1, 2, 3]`, the second window would be `[2, 3, 4]`, etc. Does that make sense?

Comment: Yes, now its clear! Thanks :)

## Answer (1)

I have written a simple code which will do the job. It uses two pointers left and right. Left pointer moves forward when there is no element on the right side of it. Right pointer always move ahead. When both pointers meet, they check whether the element on the left is zero or not. If yes, then it replaces all the zeros between them with the element on the right.

```
def func(arr):
    l=r=0
    n=len(arr)
    while r<n:
        if arr[l]!=0:
            l+=1
        else:
            if arr[r]==0:
                r+=1
            else:
                while l<=r:
                    if arr[l]==0:
                        arr[l]=arr[r]
                    l+=1
                l=r+1
        r+=1
    return arr

print(func([0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]))
```

Output :

```
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
```
