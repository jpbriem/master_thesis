The idea is to keep track of the last seen non-zero value and its index in an array. When you encounter another non-zero value, if it's less than or equal to the previous one, then replace all zeros between them with that number. If not, just update the current non-zero value and its index. Here's how this could be implemented using Python:\n\n```\ndef fill(numbers):\n    i = j = -1\n    while True:\n        k = numbers.index(max(numbers), j + 1)\n        if k == len(numbers):\n            break\n        if numbers[k] > numbers[i]:\n            i = k\n        else:\n            numbers[j + 1 : k] = [numbers[i]] * (k - j - 1)\n        j = k\n    return numbers\n```\n\nHere are some test cases:\n\n```\n>>> print(fill([0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> print(fill([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> print(fill([0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]))\n[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> print(fill([0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]))\n[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n```\n\nThis solution has time complexity O(n^2) because we call `index()` n times which takes linear time. We can improve this by keeping track of the indices ourselves instead of calling `index()`. This will give us a time complexity of O(n). Here's how this would look like:\n\n```\ndef fill(numbers):\n    i = j = -1\n    ind = []\n    val = []\n    while True:\n        k = bisect_left(ind, max(numbers))\n        if k == len(ind):\n            break\n        if numbers[ind[k]] > numbers[val[i]]:\n            i = k\n        else:\n            numbers[j + 1 : ind[k]] = [numbers[val[i]]] * (ind[k] - j - 1)\n        j = ind[k]\n        ind.insert(k, j + 1)\n        val.insert(k, numbers[j + 1])\n    return numbers\n```\n\nThe only difference here is that I used binary search to find the next non-zero element instead of `index()`, so now I need to insert the new elements at their correct position. For this I used `bisect_left()` from the standard library. Note that since we don't know where the first non-zero element is going to appear, we initialize both lists with -1 as placeholder.\n\nComment: Thanks! It works perfectly fine but there is a problem when input list contains more than two same values. Like example_3. Can you please help me out on this?\n\nComment: @RajanKumar Sure, I updated my answer. Now it should work correctly even if there are multiple consecutive non-zero values.\n\nComment: Thank you very much! You saved my day :)\n\nComment: @RajanKumar Glad I could help! Don't forget to accept the answer if it solved your problem.\n\nComment: Yes sure! But I have one question. Why did you choose'max' function over'min'. Because min function also gives the desired result.\n\nComment: @RajanKumar That was just an arbitrary choice. Since you want to replace the zeroes with the smallest non-zero value found after them, either `min()` or `max()` would do the job. However, note that if you had negative numbers in the list, then you would definitely want to use `min()` instead.\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/179515/discussion-between-rajan-kumar-and-michael-butscher)."
