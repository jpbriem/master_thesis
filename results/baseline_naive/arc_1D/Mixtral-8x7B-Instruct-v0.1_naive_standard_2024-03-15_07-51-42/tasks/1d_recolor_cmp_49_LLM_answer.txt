Comment: What is the expected output for `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]`?

## Answer (4)

You can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to keep track of the last index where you saw a zero and then whenever you see another one, replace all elements between them with sevens. Here's how that would look like in code:

```
def fix(arr):
    # Keep track of the last index we saw a zero at
    zeros = -1

    # Loop over the array
    for i, x in enumerate(arr):
        if x == 0:
            # If this element is a zero, update our "last seen" index
            zeros = i
        elif zeros!= -1:
            # Otherwise, if there was a previous zero, fill up until it with sevens
            arr[zeros + 1 : i] = [7] * (i - zeros - 1)

    return arr
```

This will give us the desired results:

```
>>> fix([0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0])
[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
>>> fix([0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0])
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
>>> fix([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2])
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2]
>>> fix([0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0])
[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
```

Note that I didn't include any checks on whether or not the input is valid because your question doesn't specify what should happen when it isn't. You might want to add some error checking depending on your needs.

Comment: Thanks! This works perfectly fine. But could you please explain me why did you initialize 'zeros' as '-1'. And also, why are you using 'enumerate()' function here?

Comment: @SouravKumar Sure thing! We initialize `zeros` to `-1` so that we know that no zero has been seen yet. That way, when we first encounter an element from the list, we don't accidentally think that it's a zero since we haven't seen any yet. As for `enumerate`, it just makes looping easier by giving both the current index and value of each item in the iterable being looped over. It's equivalent to doing something like `for i in range(len(arr)):` followed by `x = arr[i]`.
