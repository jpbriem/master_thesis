Comment: What is the expected output for `[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`?

## Answer (4)

You can use a simple loop to find the first non-zero element and then another one to fill all elements up to that index with zeroes. Here's an example implementation in Python:

```
def moveZeroes(nums):
    if not nums or len(nums) == 1:
        return

    # Find the first non-zero element
    i = 0
    while i < len(nums) - 1 and nums[i + 1]!= 0:
        i += 1

    # If there are no non-zero elements left, just return
    if i >= len(nums) - 1:
        return

    # Fill all elements up to this index with zeroes
    j = 0
    while j <= i:
        nums[j] = 0
        j += 1

# Test cases
print(moveZeroes([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(moveZeroes([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]))
print(moveZeroes([0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(moveZeroes([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
```

Output:

```
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This solution has time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the input list. It also uses constant space complexity O(1).

--------------------

If you want to do it using two pointers instead, here's how you could implement it:

```
def moveZeroes(nums):
    if not nums or len(nums) == 1:
        return

    read = 0
    write = 0

    # Move through the array until we reach its end
    while read < len(nums):
        # If the current element is non-zero, copy it over to the next free position
        if nums[read]!= 0:
            nums[write] = nums[read]
            write += 1

        read += 1

    # Set all remaining positions to zero
    while write < len(nums):
        nums[write] = 0
        write += 1

# Test cases
print(moveZeroes([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(moveZeroes([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]))
print(moveZeroes([0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(moveZeroes([0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
```

The output will be exactly the same as before. This solution also has time complexity O(n) and constant space complexity O(1).

Comment: I think your answer is correct but I was looking for something like two pointer approach. Thanks anyways!

Comment: @AkshayKumar Sure thing! I added a second version which does it using two pointers. Let me know if anything isn't clear about it.

## Answer (1)

Here is my solution using two pointers. The idea is to have two pointers, one pointing at the beginning of the array and the other pointing at the last non-zero element. Then swap them and increment both pointers by one. Repeat this process till the first pointer reaches the end of the array.

```
public void moveZerosToEnd(int[] arr){
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;

    //loop till the first pointer reaches the end of the array
    while(start<end){
        //if the value at the first pointer is zero, increment it
        if(arr[start]==0){
            start++;
        }else{
            //swap values at the first and last pointer
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            //decrement the last pointer
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

I would suggest doing it in place without creating new arrays. You can keep track of the number of zeros encountered so far and when you encounter a non-zero number, replace the first zero from the front of the array with the non-zero number.

```
void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
    int countOfZeros = 0;
    for(auto &x : nums) {
        if(!x) {
            ++countOfZeros;
        } else if(countOfZeros > 0) {
            x = nums[--countOfZeros];
            x = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

**Python:**

```
def moveZeroes(nums):
    """
    Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
    """
    l=len(nums)
    c=0
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i]!=0:
            nums[c]=nums[i]
            c+=1
    for i in range(c,l):
        nums[i]=0

# Driver Code
nums=[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
moveZeroes(nums)
print(nums)
```

**Output:**

> ```
> [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
> ```
