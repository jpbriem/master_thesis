Explanation:
The problem statement is clear. The problem is to check if the given input is a valid sequence or not. A valid sequence is a sequence of characters where each character appears at least once.

The approach to solve this problem is to use a hash table to keep track of the characters in the sequence. If a character is not present in the hash table, then we add it to the sequence. If a character is already present in the hash table, then we add it to the sequence only if it is not already present in the sequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input. The space complexity of this solution is O(min(n, k)) where k is the size of the hash table.

The code for the solution is as follows:
```
def is_valid_sequence(s):
    # Create an empty hash table
    ht = {}
    
    # Loop through the input string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Get the current character
        c = s[i]
        
        # If the character is not in the hash table, add it
        if c not in ht:
            ht[c] = 1
        else:
            # If the character is already in the hash table,
            # add it to the sequence only if it is not already
            # present in the sequence
            if ht[c] == 1:
                ht[c] = 2
            else:
                ht[c] = 3
    
    # If all the characters have a value of 2, the sequence is valid
    # Otherwise, the sequence is invalid
    return all(ht[c] == 2 for c in ht)
```
The output of the code for the test case is:
```
True
```</s>
