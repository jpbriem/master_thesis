In this case, the program should output the same list as input.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list is empty. In this case, the program should output an empty list.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list contains only one character. In this case, the program should output the same list as input.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list contains only one 'd' character. In this case, the program should output the same list as input.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list contains multiple 'd' characters. In this case, the program should output the same list as input, with the dots replaced by the same number of dots as there are 'd' characters in the input list.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list contains only dots. In this case, the program should output an empty list.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list contains only one dot. In this case, the program should output the same list as input.\n\nThe program should handle the case where the input list contains multiple dots.
