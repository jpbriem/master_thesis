Maintain two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and another at its end. If both pointers are pointing to zeros, move them towards each other until they meet or cross. Otherwise, if either pointer is not pointing to zero, update the element pointed by the second pointer with the value pointed by the first pointer and move both pointers towards each other.\nHere's the Python code that implements this algorithm:\n```python\ndef compress(arr):\n    i = j = 0\n    n = len(arr)\n    while j < n:\n        if arr[j] == 0:\n            while i < j:\n                arr[i] = 0\n                i += 1\n            i = j + 1\n        else:\n            arr[j] = min(arr[j], arr[i])\n            j += 1\n    while i < n:\n        arr[i] = 0\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n\n# Test cases\nprint(compress([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7])) # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7]\nprint(compress([0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7])) # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]\nprint(compress([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0])) # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0]\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is also O(1) since we only need a constant amount of extra memory to store the two pointers."
