LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given array is a combination of two arrays, one containing only 8s and another containing only 0s. The task is to transform the array such that all the elements are either 7 or 8, but not both.
To achieve this, we need to find the maximum value in each subarray of length 4 (or more) and replace it with 8 if it's less than 8, else leave it as it is. If there are multiple occurrences of the same value within a subarray, we will replace all of them with 8.

For example, in the first test case, the subarray [0, 0, 0, 8] has a maximum value of 8, so we replace all the 0s with 7s. In the second test case, the subarray [0, 0, 8, 8] has a maximum value of 8, so we replace all the 0s with 7s. In the third test case, the subarray [0, 0, 8, 8, 8] has a maximum value of 8, so we replace all the 0s with 7s. In the last test case, the subarray [0, 0, 8, 0, 0] has no maximum value, so we don't modify any element.

Solution:
[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
