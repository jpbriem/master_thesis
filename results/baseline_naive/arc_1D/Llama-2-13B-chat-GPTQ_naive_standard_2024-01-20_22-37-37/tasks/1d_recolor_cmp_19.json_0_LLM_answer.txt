LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given input is a list of integers, where each integer represents a character in the original string. The output is also a list of integers, but with some transformations applied to the input values.

The transformation pattern is as follows:

* If the input value is 7, it is replaced by 4.
* If the input value is 0, it is removed from the output list.

So, the output list will have only the non-zero values from the input list, and all the zero values will be removed.

In example 1, there are two occurrences of 7, so the output will have two 4s instead of two 7s. In example 2, there are three occurrences of 7, so the output will have three 4s instead of three 7s. In example 3, there are four occurrences of 7, so the output will have four 4s instead of four 7s.

In the test case, there are seven occurrences of 7, so the output will have seven 4s instead of seven 7s.

Solution:
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0]
