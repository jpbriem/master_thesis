LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given input array is a list of integers, where each integer represents a character in the alphabet. The output array should be transformed such that each group of consecutive identical characters (i.e., runs) is replaced by a single integer representing the length of that run.
For example, in the first input array [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], there are three runs of the digit 7, so the output array should be [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0].
Similarly, for the second input array [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], there are four runs of the digit 7, so the output array should be [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8].
In the third input array [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], there are five runs of the digit 7, so the output array should be [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6].
In the test case, there are eight runs of the digit 7, so the output array should be [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8].

Solution:
[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
