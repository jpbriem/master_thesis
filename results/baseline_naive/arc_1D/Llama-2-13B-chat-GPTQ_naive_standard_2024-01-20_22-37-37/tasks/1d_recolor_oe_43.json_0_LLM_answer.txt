LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given input is a list of integers, where each integer represents a binary digit (0 or 1). The output is also a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of consecutive 1s in the original list.

To transform the input to the output, we need to iterate through the input list and keep track of the current length of the sequence of consecutive 1s. Whenever we encounter a 0, we reset the sequence length to 0. If the current element is 1, we increment the sequence length by 1. At the end of the iteration, we return the final sequence length as the output.

In Example_1, the input list contains two sequences of consecutive 1s: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and [1, 1, 1]. The output is the sum of these two sequence lengths, which is 8.

In Example_2, the input list contains three sequences of consecutive 1s: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1], and [1]. The output is the sum of these three sequence lengths, which is 8 + 5 + 5 = 18.

In Example_3, the input list contains four sequences of consecutive 1s: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1], [1], and [1]. The output is the sum of these four sequence lengths, which is 8 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 23.

In the test case, the input list contains five sequences of consecutive 1s: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1], [1], [1], and [1]. The output is the sum of these five sequence lengths, which is 8 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 29.

Solution:
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]
