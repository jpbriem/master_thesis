LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input element is either 0 or 8. We can divide the input into two parts: elements that are 0 (represented by "0" in the output) and elements that are 8 (represented by "8" in the output).
We then apply a series of shifts to the two parts, depending on their values. If an element is 0, we shift it to the left by 1 position. If an element is 8, we shift it to the right by 1 position. This creates a new sequence where all the 0s are grouped together and all the 8s are grouped together.
Finally, we replace any remaining 0s with 6, since they are not part of the original input sequence.

Solution:
[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
