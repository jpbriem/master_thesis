LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 7, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 7, where each number appears twice except for 0 which appears three times. We can observe that the array has a cyclic structure, where each group of four numbers repeats.

To transform the array into the desired format, we need to find the starting point of each cycle and then apply the appropriate transformations to each group of four numbers.

We can identify the starting points of each cycle by looking for the first occurrence of each number in the array. Once we have identified the starting points, we can apply the following transformations to each group of four numbers:

* For each group of four numbers, we add 1 to each number except for the last one, which remains unchanged. This ensures that each number appears only once in the final output.
* If the last number in the group is not 0, we add 1 to it as well. This ensures that all numbers appear at least once in the final output, even if they appear more than once in the original array.

With these transformations, we get the desired output for each test case.

[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
