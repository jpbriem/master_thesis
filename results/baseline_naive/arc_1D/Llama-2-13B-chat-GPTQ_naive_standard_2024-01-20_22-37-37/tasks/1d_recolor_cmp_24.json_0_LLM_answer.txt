LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 9. We can observe that each number appears exactly twice in the array except for one number (9) which appears three times. Therefore, we need to find two numbers that appear only once in the array and replace them with their corresponding duplicates.

We can use a hash table to keep track of the counts of each number. Initialize the hash table with all zeros, then iterate through the array and update the count of each number accordingly. After iterating through the array, we can see that there are two numbers that appear only once in the array, i.e., 2 and 8. So, we replace these numbers with their corresponding duplicates in the array. Finally, we print the transformed array.
