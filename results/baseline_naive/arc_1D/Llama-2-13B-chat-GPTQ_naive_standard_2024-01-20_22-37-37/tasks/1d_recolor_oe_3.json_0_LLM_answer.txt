LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a combination of two arrays, one containing only 0s and 3s, and another containing only 0s and 8s. We need to transform the given array into an array containing only 0s and 6s.

We can observe that each element in the original array is either 0 or 3, and we need to replace all 0s with 6s and all 3s with 8s. To achieve this, we can use a simple bitwise AND operation (&) to keep only the elements that are 0s or 3s. Then, we can use a bitwise OR operation (|) to combine all the elements that are 0s or 3s into a single array.

Finally, we can assign the result to the output variable.
