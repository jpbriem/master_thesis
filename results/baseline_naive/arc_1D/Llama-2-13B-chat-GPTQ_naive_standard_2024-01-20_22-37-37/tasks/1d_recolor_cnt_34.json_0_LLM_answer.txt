LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 9. We can observe that the numbers in the array are arranged in a zigzag pattern, where each number is either twice the previous number or half the previous number.
We can exploit this property to transform the array into a new array with only unique elements.

Step 1: Identify the base cases
We can identify two base cases:

* When the input array has only one element, there is no need for any further transformation. So, we can stop the process and return the original array.
* When the input array has only two elements, and one of them is zero, we can directly return the other element as the output. This is because we know that all the non-zero elements in the array will be doubled, and all the zero elements will be halved.

Step 2: Transform the input array
Now, let's consider an input array with more than one element. We can apply the following rules to transform the array:

* If the current element is zero, double the next element (if it exists).
* If the current element is not zero, half it.

We can repeat these steps until we reach the end of the array or until we find a base case.

Step 3: Check for base cases
After applying the above rules, we need to check if we have reached a base case. If we have, we can return the transformed array. Otherwise, we continue applying the rules until we reach a base case.

Step 4: Return the result
Finally, we return the transformed array.

Note: In the example inputs provided, the resulting arrays have only unique elements, and the order of the elements is preserved. However, the actual implementation may produce different results based on the specific input array.
