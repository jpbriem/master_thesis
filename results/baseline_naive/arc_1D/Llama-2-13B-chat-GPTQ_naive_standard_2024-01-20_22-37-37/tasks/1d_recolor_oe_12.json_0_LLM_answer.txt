LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 4. We can observe that each number appears exactly once in the array except for the last four elements which all have the value 4. To transform this array into a sorted one, we need to move these last four elements to their respective positions based on their values.

We can do this by iterating over the array and keeping track of the current position of each element. If an element has a value less than 4, we move it to its final position immediately. If an element has a value greater than or equal to 4, we keep track of its position and move it to its final position only after all smaller elements have been moved. This way, we ensure that all elements are moved to their correct positions based on their values.

For example, in Example_1, the input array is [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], and the output array is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Here, we start by moving the first four elements (0, 4, 4, 4) to their final positions since they are all less than 4. Then, we move the next two elements (4, 4) to their final positions since they are both greater than or equal to 4. Finally, we move the remaining three elements (4, 4, 4) to their final positions.

In Example_2, the input array is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], and the output array is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6]. Here, we start by moving the first four elements (0, 0, 0, 4) to their final positions since they are all less than 4. Then, we move the next two elements (4, 4) to their final positions since they are both greater than or equal to 4. Finally, we move the remaining two elements (4, 4) to their final positions.

In Example_3, the input array is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], and the output array is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Here, we start by moving the first five elements (0, 0, 0, 4, 4) to their final positions since they are all less than 4. Then, we move the next three elements (4, 4, 4) to their final positions since they are all greater than or equal to 4. Finally, we move the remaining two elements (4, 4) to their final positions.

In the test case, the input array is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], and the output array is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6]. Here, we start by moving the first nine elements (0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0) to their final positions since they are all less than 4. Then, we move the next four elements (4, 4, 4, 4) to their final positions since they are all greater than or equal to 4. Finally, we move the remaining two elements (4, 4) to their final positions.
