LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input element can be either 0 or 8. We define a new array with two possible values: 0 and 3 (since 8 is equal to 3*2). Then we iterate through the input array and for each element, we update the corresponding value in the new array according to the following rules:

* If the input element is 0, we set the corresponding value in the new array to 0.
* If the input element is 8, we set the corresponding value in the new array to 3.

This transformation preserves the relative positions of the elements in the input array, but changes their absolute values. Specifically, all elements that were originally 0 become 0 in the output, and all elements that were originally 8 become 3 in the output.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
