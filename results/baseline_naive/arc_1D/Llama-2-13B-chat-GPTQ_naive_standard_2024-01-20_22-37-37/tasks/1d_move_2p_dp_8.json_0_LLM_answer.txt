LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a sorted list of integers, where each integer appears twice except for two elements that appear only once. We can observe that all the elements in the array are either 0 or 3. Our goal is to transform this array into another array with the same length, but with only one element appearing twice, i.e., 0.

To achieve this, we need to find the index of the unique element (in this case, 3) and then replace all instances of that element with 0. After doing so, we will have an array with only one element appearing twice, which is 0.

Here's how we can implement this solution step by step:

Step 1: Find the index of the unique element (3).
We can do this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the current element and its frequency. If we encounter an element that appears only once, we know it's the unique element. In this case, we find the index of the unique element as follows:

index = binary_search(arr, 3); // returns the index of the first occurrence of 3

Step 2: Replace all instances of the unique element (3) with 0.
Now that we have found the index of the unique element, we can replace all instances of 3 with 0. We can do this using a simple loop that iterates through the array and updates the corresponding elements:

for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == 3) {
        arr[i] = 0;
    }
}

After these two steps, we have transformed the original array into the desired output array with only one element appearing twice, i.e., 0.
