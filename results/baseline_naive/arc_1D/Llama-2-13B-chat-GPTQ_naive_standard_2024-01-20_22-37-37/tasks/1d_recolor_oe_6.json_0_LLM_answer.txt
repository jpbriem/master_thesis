LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 7, with each number appearing exactly once. We can observe that the array has a cyclic structure, where each group of four consecutive numbers repeats. Therefore, we can apply a simple transformation to the array by shifting each group of four consecutive numbers by one position to the right, effectively rotating the entire array by one position clockwise. This transformation will result in all the numbers being shifted by one position to the right, except for the first and last elements, which remain unchanged.

For example, in the test case, the input array is [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7], and after applying the transformation, the output array becomes [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0].

Note that the transformation only affects the elements within each group of four consecutive numbers, leaving the remaining elements unchanged. This allows us to solve the problem efficiently using a simple rotation operation.
