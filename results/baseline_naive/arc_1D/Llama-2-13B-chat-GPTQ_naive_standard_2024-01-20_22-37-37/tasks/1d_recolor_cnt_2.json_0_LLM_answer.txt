LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 9. We can observe that the array has two types of elements - ones (0) and threes (3). Our goal is to transform this array into another array where each element is either 0 or 4.

We can achieve this by applying the following steps:

Step 1: Find all ones (0) in the input array and replace them with 4.
Step 2: Find all threes (3) in the input array and replace them with 0.

After these two steps, we will have our desired output array.

Here's how we implement these steps:

Step 1: Find all ones (0) in the input array and replace them with 4.
We can do this by iterating through the input array and checking if the current element is 0. If it is, we replace it with 4.

Step 2: Find all threes (3) in the input array and replace them with 0.
We can do this by iterating through the input array and checking if the current element is 3. If it is, we replace it with 0.

By implementing these two steps, we get our desired output array.
