LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The solution is based on the observation that each input has a repeating pattern of ones and zeros. Specifically, each input has a sequence of ones followed by a sequence of zeros. We can exploit this pattern to transform the input into an output with a similar structure.

To achieve this, we define a function that takes an input array of integers and returns an output array of integers. This function applies the following steps:

Step 1: Count the number of consecutive ones in the input array.

Step 2: Assign a unique value to each group of consecutive ones.

Step 3: Replace each one in the input array with its assigned value.

Step 4: Replace each zero in the input array with the corresponding value from Step 2 (i.e., the value assigned to the previous group of ones).

Here's how the function works for each example:

For Example_1, there are three groups of consecutive ones: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1], and [1]. Each group is assigned a unique value: 7, 2, and 2, respectively. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

For Example_2, there are four groups of consecutive ones: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1], [1], and [1]. Each group is assigned a unique value: 2, 2, 7, and 7, respectively. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

For Example_3, there are five groups of consecutive ones: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1], [1], [1], and [1]. Each group is assigned a unique value: 7, 7, 2, 2, 2, and 2, respectively. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

For the test case, there are nine groups of consecutive ones: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], and [1]. Each group is assigned a unique value: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, and 0. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
