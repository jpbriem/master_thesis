LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a bitmask representing a set of integers. Each element in the array represents a single integer from 0 to 7. To convert this bitmask to a list of integers, we need to perform a series of shifts and adds.

Here's how it works:

1. First, we shift each element in the array one position to the right (i.e., multiply by 2). This effectively doubles the size of each element.
2. Next, we add 1 to each element. This adds the value 1 to each element, which will be important later.
3. Now, we iterate through the array and keep track of the number of times each element appears in the original bitmask. We do this by keeping a count of the number of times each element appears in the current row.
4. Once we've iterated through the entire array, we can use these counts to construct our final list of integers. Specifically, we take each element in the array, divide it by 2 (to undo the previous shift), and then add the count of that element to the result. This gives us the final list of integers.

For example, consider the input array [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Here's how the algorithm works for each element:

* Element 0: Shifted by 2 to the right, we get 0 << 2 = 0. Adding 1 gives us 1. The count of 0 is 3, so we add 3 to the result, giving us 4.
* Element 1: Shifted by 2 to the right, we get 1 << 2 = 1. Adding 1 gives us 2. The count of 1 is 2, so we add 2 to the result, giving us 4.
* Element 2: Shifted by 2 to the right, we get 0 << 2 = 0. Adding 1 gives us 1. The count of 0 is 2, so we add 2 to the result, giving us 3.

And so on. At the end of the algorithm, we have our final list of integers: [4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0].
