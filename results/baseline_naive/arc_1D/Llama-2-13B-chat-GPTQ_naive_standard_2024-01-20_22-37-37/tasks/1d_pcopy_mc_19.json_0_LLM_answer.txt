LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Expected result:
The expected output for each test case is a list of integers that represents the transformed input. In each example, the input is transformed by applying the same set of rules to each element in the input list. These rules include:

* If the input value is 0, leave it unchanged.
* If the input value is not 0, multiply it by 2 (or 3 for the third example).
* If the input value is already negative, do not change its sign.

For example, in Example_1, the input value 6 is multiplied by 2 to become 12, and the input value 0 becomes 0. In Example_2, the input value 7 is multiplied by 3 to become 21, and the input value 0 becomes 0. In Example_3, the input value 1 is multiplied by 3 to become 3, and the input value 0 becomes 0.

In the test case, the input value 5 is multiplied by 2 to become 10, and the input value 0 becomes 0.
