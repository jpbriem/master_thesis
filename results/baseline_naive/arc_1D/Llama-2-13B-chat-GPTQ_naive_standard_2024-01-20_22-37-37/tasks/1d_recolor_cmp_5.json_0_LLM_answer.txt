LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input element can be either 0 or 3. We can represent the input as a binary vector where each element is either 0 or 3. Then we apply a series of XOR operations to the binary vector to produce the output. Specifically, for each pair of adjacent elements in the input, we perform an XOR operation between them if they have different values (i.e., one is 0 and the other is 3). This produces a new binary vector with the same number of elements as the input, but with all elements set to 0 except for those that were XORed. Finally, we take the inverse of the resulting binary vector to obtain the output.

Note that this solution only works because the input is guaranteed to contain at least two consecutive identical elements (either both 0 or both 3). If there are no such consecutive identical elements, then the transformation will not work correctly.
