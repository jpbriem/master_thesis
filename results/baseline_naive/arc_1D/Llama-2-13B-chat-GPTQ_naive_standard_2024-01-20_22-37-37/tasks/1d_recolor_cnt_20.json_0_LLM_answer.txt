LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 8. We can observe that the numbers in the array are arranged in a zigzag pattern, where each number is either 0 or 8 more than the previous number.
To transform this array into the desired output, we need to find the starting point of each zigzag segment and then apply the appropriate transformation to each segment.
We can identify the starting points of the segments by looking for the first occurrence of each number in the array. Once we have identified the starting points, we can apply the following transformations to each segment:

* If the current number is 0, we add 8 to it.
* If the current number is not 0, we subtract 8 from it.

By applying these transformations to each segment, we get the desired output.
Note that the output is also a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 8, but with the numbers rearranged in a different order.
