LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 7, with each number appearing exactly once. We can observe that the array has a cyclic structure, where each group of four numbers repeats twice. Therefore, we can apply a simple transformation to the array by shifting each group of four numbers by one position to the right, effectively rotating the array by half a cycle. This transformation will produce an array where each number appears in its final position.

To implement this solution, we can use a simple loop that iterates over the input array and applies the shift operation to each group of four numbers. Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, we check if the current element is not zero, and if it is, we shift the next three elements to the right by one position. If the current element is zero, we do nothing, as the element is already in its final position. By repeating this process until the end of the array, we ensure that all non-zero elements are shifted to their correct positions, resulting in the desired output.
