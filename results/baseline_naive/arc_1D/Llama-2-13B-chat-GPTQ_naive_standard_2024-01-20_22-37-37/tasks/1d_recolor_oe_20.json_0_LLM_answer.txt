LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given input array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 9. We can observe that the digits are arranged in a zigzag pattern, where each digit is either 3 or 6 times the previous digit.
To achieve this zigzag pattern, we can use a simple transformation formula:

output[i] = (input[i] + input[i+1]) mod 3

where i is the index of the input array, and input[i+1] is the next element in the input array.

We can prove that this formula produces the correct output by examining the properties of the transformation:

1. If input[i] = j, then output[i] = (j + input[i+1]) mod 3 = (j + k) mod 3, where k is the next element in the input array. Since j + k is always less than or equal to 9, the output value is always less than or equal to 3.
2. If input[i] = 0, then output[i] = (0 + input[i+1]) mod 3 = (0 + k) mod 3 = k mod 3, since 0 + k is always equal to k. Therefore, the output value is always equal to 0.

By applying this transformation to the input array, we get the desired output.
