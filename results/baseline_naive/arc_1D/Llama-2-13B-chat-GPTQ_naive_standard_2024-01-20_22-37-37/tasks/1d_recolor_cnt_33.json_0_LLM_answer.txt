LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 7, with each number appearing exactly once. We can observe that the array has a cyclic structure, where each group of four numbers (0, 7, 7, 7) repeats twice.

To transform the array into the output, we need to find the starting point of each cycle and then apply a series of simple transformations based on the position of each element in the cycle. Specifically, for each cycle, we do the following:

* If the element is less than 4 (i.e., in the first half of the cycle), we add 3 to its value.
* If the element is greater than or equal to 4 (i.e., in the second half of the cycle), we subtract 3 from its value.

By applying these transformations to each cycle, we can transform the original array into the desired output.

Note that the transformation pattern is not limited to the specific example inputs provided. It can be applied more generally to any array of integers that has a cyclic structure with repeating patterns of values.
