LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given input is a list of integers, where each integer represents a character in a string. The task is to transform this list into another list of integers, such that the resulting list has the same length as the original list, but with all elements equal to 2.

To achieve this, we need to perform a series of bitwise operations on the input list. Specifically, for each element in the input list, we perform the following operations:

* If the element is 0, leave it unchanged.
* If the element is 2, set it to 2*2 = 4.

By doing so, we effectively double the value of each non-zero element in the input list, resulting in a new list where all elements are equal to 2.

Note that the transformation is done in place, meaning that the output is built up by modifying the input list directly. This is why the output list is the same length as the input list, and why the elements are all equal to 2.

Solution:
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
