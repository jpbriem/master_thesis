LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through each element in the input array and applying a series of transformations to it. These transformations include:

* If the current element is 0, set it to 9.
* If the current element is not 0, add 8 to its value.

For example, in Example_1, the input array contains several elements that have a value of 8. When these elements are processed by the algorithm, they are incremented to 9 because 8 + 8 = 16, which is greater than 9. Similarly, any elements with a value of 0 are set to 9.

In Example_2, there are no elements with a value of 8, so none of them need to be incremented. However, there are some elements with a value of 0, which are set to 9 as per the rule.

In Example_3, all elements have a value of 0, so they are all set to 9.

In the test case, all elements have a value of 8 or 0, so they are either incremented to 9 or set to 9 directly.

Solution:
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
