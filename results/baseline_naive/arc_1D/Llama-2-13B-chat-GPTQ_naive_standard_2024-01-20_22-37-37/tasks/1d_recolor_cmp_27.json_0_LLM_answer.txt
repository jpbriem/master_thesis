LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 7, where each number appears exactly once, except for one occurrence of 7 which appears twice. Our goal is to transform this array into another array where each number appears exactly twice, except for one occurrence of 0 which appears zero times.

To achieve this, we can use a simple transformation rule: for each element x in the input array, if x == 7, then set the corresponding element in the output array to 1. Otherwise (i.e., if x!= 7), set the corresponding element in the output array to 0.

This transformation rule is based on the fact that the only repeated element in the input array is 7, and we want to replace each occurrence of 7 with 1. All other elements (i.e., those that are not 7) should be replaced with 0.

Therefore, the expected output for the given input array is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0].
