LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
output: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input element can be either 0 or 3. We can represent the input as a binary vector where each element is either 0 or 3. Then we apply a series of XOR operations to the binary vector to produce the output. Specifically, for each pair of adjacent elements in the input, we perform an XOR operation between them if they have different values (i.e., one is 0 and the other is 3). This produces a new binary vector with the same length as the input, but with some elements set to 2 instead of 0 or 3. Finally, we convert the binary vector back to an integer list by interpreting each element as an index into a list of size 3.

Note that this solution only works because the input list has a fixed length and consists only of 0s and 3s. If the input list had other values or varied lengths, this approach would not work.

Solution:
[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
