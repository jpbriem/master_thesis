LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 9. We can observe that each number appears exactly three times in the array except for the number 5 which does not appear at all. Therefore, we can say that the array is a combination of three consecutive cycles of length 3 each.

To transform the array into the desired format, we need to find these cycles and apply the appropriate transformations to each cycle. Let's denote the three cycles as C1, C2, and C3.

Cycle C1 consists of the first three elements [0, 3, 3]. To transform this cycle, we simply need to add 1 to each element, i.e., [0 + 1, 3 + 1, 3 + 1] = [1, 4, 4].

Cycle C2 consists of the next three elements [3, 0, 0]. To transform this cycle, we need to subtract 3 from each element, i.e., [3 - 3, 0 - 3, 0 - 3] = [0, -3, -3].

Cycle C3 consists of the remaining five elements [3, 3, 0, 0, 3]. To transform this cycle, we need to add 3 to each element, i.e., [3 + 3, 3 + 3, 0 + 3, 0 + 3, 3 + 3] = [6, 6, 3, 3, 6].

Now, let's combine the transformed cycles:

[1, 4, 4, -3, -3, -3, 6, 6, 6]

As we can see, the resulting array has the required format. Each element is either 1 or 6, and there are no negative numbers.

[0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
