LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 9. We can observe that the digits are arranged in a zigzag pattern, where each digit is either 5 or 9. Our goal is to transform this array into another array such that the resulting array has only the digits 0 to 4.
To achieve this, we need to find a way to map each digit in the original array to its corresponding digit in the range of 0 to 4. We can do this by using a simple transformation rule based on the parity of each digit.
If the digit is even (i.e., it is divisible by 2), then we map it to 0. Otherwise (i.e., if the digit is odd), we map it to 1. This transformation ensures that all the digits in the resulting array are less than or equal to 4.
We can implement this transformation using a simple loop that iterates over the input array and applies the above mapping rule to each digit. The output array will contain the transformed values, which are guaranteed to be less than or equal to 4.
