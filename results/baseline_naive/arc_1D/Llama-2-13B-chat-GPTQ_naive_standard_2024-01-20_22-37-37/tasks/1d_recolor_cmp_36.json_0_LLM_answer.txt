LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through the input array and keeping track of the number of consecutive elements that have the same value. When a new element is encountered that has the same value as the previous element, the counter for that value is incremented. If the current element has a different value than the previous element, the counter for the previous element is reset to 0.

At the end of the iteration, the output array is filled with the counts of each unique value in the input array. Each element in the output array represents the number of times a particular value appears in the input array.

For example, in Example_1, the input array contains the sequence [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has three distinct values (0, 2, and 3). The output array would be [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], where each element represents the count of the corresponding value in the input array.

In Example_2, the input array contains the sequence [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], which has four distinct values (0, 2, and 3 twice). The output array would be [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], where each element represents the count of the corresponding value in the input array.

In Example_3, the input array contains the sequence [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], which has five distinct values (0, 2, and 3 three times). The output array would be [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], where each element represents the count of the corresponding value in the input array.

In the test case, the input array contains the sequence [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has seven distinct values (0, 2, and 3 three times). The output array would be [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], where each element represents the count of the corresponding value in the input array.
