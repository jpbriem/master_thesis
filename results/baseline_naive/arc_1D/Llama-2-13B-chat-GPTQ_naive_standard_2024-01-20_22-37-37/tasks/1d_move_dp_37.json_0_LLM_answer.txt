LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0]

Expected result:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Please help me understand why my solution is incorrect? I am unable to identify the mistake in my approach.

Answer:
Your solution is correct, but you are not using the "transformation" concept correctly. In this problem, we need to transform each element of the input array into a specific value based on its index.

In your solution, you are simply shifting all elements by 1 position to the right. This is not the correct transformation.

Here's how you can fix your solution:

For example, for the input `[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]`, you should transform it as follows:

* First element (index 0) becomes `0`
* Second element (index 1) becomes `7`
* Third element (index 2) becomes `7`
* Fourth element (index 3) becomes `7`
* Fifth element (index 4) becomes `7`
* Sixth element (index 5) becomes `5`
* Seventh element (index 6) becomes `0`

So the transformed output should be `[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0]`.

Note that the transformation rule is based on the index of each element, not its value. Therefore, you need to use the index of each element to determine its new value.
