LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given input is a list of integers, where each integer represents a character in the original string. The output is also a list of integers, but with some transformations applied to the input values.

The transformation pattern is as follows:

* If the input value is 7, it is replaced by 9.
* If the input value is 0, it is removed from the output list.

So, the output list will have only the non-zero values from the input list, and any 7s will be replaced by 9s.

Solution:
[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7]
