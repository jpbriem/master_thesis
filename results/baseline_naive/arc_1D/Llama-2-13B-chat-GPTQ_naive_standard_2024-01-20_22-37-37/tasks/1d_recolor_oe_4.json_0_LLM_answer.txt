LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input value can be represented as a combination of two or more values from {0, 2}. Specifically, each input value can be expressed as a binary string of length 4, where each bit corresponds to one of the four possible values {0, 2}. For example, the input value [0, 0, 9, 9] can be represented as the binary string "0022".

To transform the input, we simply need to apply a series of bitwise operations to convert each input value into its corresponding binary representation. Specifically, for each input value, we perform the following operations:

* If the input value is 0, we set all four bits to 0 (i.e., "0000").
* If the input value is 9, we set all four bits to 1 (i.e., "1111").
* Otherwise (i.e., if the input value is 2), we set the first three bits to 1 and the last bit to 0 (i.e., "1100").

For example, consider the input value [0, 0, 9, 9]. Applying the above rules, we get:

* 0 becomes "0000"
* 9 becomes "1111"
* 2 becomes "1100"

Therefore, the transformed output for this input is [0, 0, 8, 8].

Similarly, applying the same rules to the other input values in the test cases yields the expected outputs.
