LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9]

Test case:

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Explanation of the transformation:
The given input is a list of integers, where each integer represents a character in the original string. The task is to transform this list of integers into another list of integers, such that the resulting list has the desired output format.

The transformation pattern is based on the fact that the original string contains only two unique characters: '0' and '9'. Therefore, we can represent each integer in the input list as a binary representation of the corresponding character. For example, the integer '9' can be represented as [1001], since it is the binary representation of the character '9'.

Using this approach, we can transform the input list into the desired output format by applying a series of bitwise operations. Specifically, for each integer in the input list, we perform the following operations:

* If the integer is less than or equal to 5 (i.e., [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]), we set the corresponding output integer to 4.
* If the integer is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 9 (i.e., [9, 9, 9, 9, 9]), we set the corresponding output integer to 9.
* Otherwise (i.e., if the integer is greater than 9), we set the corresponding output integer to 0.

By applying these transformations to the input list, we obtain the desired output format.
