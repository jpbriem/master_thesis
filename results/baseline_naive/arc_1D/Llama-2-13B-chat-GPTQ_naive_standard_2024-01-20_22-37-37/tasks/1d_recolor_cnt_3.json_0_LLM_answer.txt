LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:

LLM answer:

output: [0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through each element in the input array and keeping track of two counters: one for the number of times a given element appears in the input (i.e., its "frequency") and another for the current maximum value seen so far.

For each element in the input, we increment the frequency counter for that element if it has not been seen before. If the current maximum value is less than or equal to the current element's value, we update the maximum value seen so far and reset the frequency counter for that element.

At the end of the iteration, we output the final values of the frequency counters as the transformed array.

Note that this algorithm assumes that the input array only contains positive integers. If negative numbers or other types of inputs are allowed, additional logic may be required to handle them appropriately.
