LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 3, where each number appears exactly once. We can transform this array into another array by swapping every element with its corresponding index in the original array. Specifically, we swap each element with the element at the same position in the original array, but shifted one position to the right (i.e., if an element is at position i, we swap it with the element at position i+1). This transformation preserves the property that each number appears exactly once in the transformed array.
For example, in the test case, the input array is [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2], and the output array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]. As you can see, each element has been swapped with the corresponding element at the next position to the right, resulting in a new array with the desired properties.
