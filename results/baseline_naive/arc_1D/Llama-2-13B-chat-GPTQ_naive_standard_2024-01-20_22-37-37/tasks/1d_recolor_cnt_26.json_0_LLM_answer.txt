LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input value can be represented as a combination of three values: 0, 6, and 9. Specifically, each input value is either 0, 6, or 9, or a combination of these values. For example, the input value 4 can be represented as 0 + 6 + 0 = 4.

To transform the input values into output values, we perform the following operations:

* If the input value is 0, we set the corresponding output value to 0.
* If the input value is 6, we set the corresponding output value to 9.
* If the input value is 9, we set the corresponding output value to 3.

For example, consider the input value 4, which can be represented as 0 + 6 + 0 = 4. We set the corresponding output value to 9, since 4 = 0 + 6 + 0 = 9.

Similarly, consider the input value 7, which can be represented as 0 + 6 + 1 = 7. We set the corresponding output value to 3, since 7 = 0 + 6 + 1 = 3.

By applying this transformation to all input values, we obtain the desired output values.
