LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to n (where n is the length of the array). We can observe that the array has two types of elements - ones (1) and zeros (0). We can also observe that each element is either completely zero or completely one.

Our goal is to transform this array into another array where each element is the sum of all the previous elements that have the same index as it in the original array. In other words, we need to find the running sum of the elements in the original array.

To achieve this, we can use a simple formula: for each element x in the original array, the corresponding element in the transformed array should be the sum of all previous elements that have the same index as x in the original array.

For example, consider the first element x = 0 in the original array. The previous elements with the same index as x are all zeros, so the corresponding element in the transformed array should be 0. Similarly, considering the second element x = 1, the previous elements with the same index as x are all ones, so the corresponding element in the transformed array should be 1 + 1 +... + 1 (i.e., n ones) = n.

Therefore, the output for the given input array will be [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], which is the desired transformation.
