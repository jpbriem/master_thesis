LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 7. We can observe that each number appears exactly three times in the array, except for one number (which appears four times). Therefore, we can apply a simple transformation to the array by replacing each number with its index modulo 3.

For example, if we have the number 7 in the original array, we know that it appears four times. So, we replace each occurrence of 7 with 0 (since 0 is the first number that is not present in the original array). Similarly, we replace each occurrence of 0 with 3 (since there are three zeros in the original array).

After applying this transformation, we get the desired output array.
