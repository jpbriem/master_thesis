LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 3, where each number appears exactly once. We can transform this array into another array where each element is either 0 or 5, depending on whether the corresponding number in the original array was even (i.e., multiple of 2) or odd (i.e., not multiple of 2).
To achieve this, we iterate through the input array and keep track of two running sums: one for the even elements and one for the odd elements. When we encounter an element that is even (i.e., multiple of 2), we add it to the sum of even elements; when we encounter an element that is odd (i.e., not multiple of 2), we add it to the sum of odd elements. At the end, we subtract the sum of odd elements from the sum of even elements to get the final answer.
Note that the output array has only two possible values: 0 and 5. This is because any element in the input array that is even (i.e., multiple of 2) will be transformed into 5, while any element that is odd (i.e., not multiple of 2) will be transformed into 0.
