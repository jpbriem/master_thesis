LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input value can be either 0 or a multiple of 6. We can therefore represent the input as a sequence of multiples of 6, with each element being either 0 or a multiple of 6.
For example, in Example_1, the input is [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], which can be represented as a sequence of multiples of 6 as follows:
[0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60]

Similarly, in Example_2, the input is [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], which can be represented as a sequence of multiples of 6 as follows:
[0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54]

In both cases, we can see that each input value is either 0 or a multiple of 6, and we can use this property to transform the input into the output. Specifically, we add 6 to each input value that is not 0, and leave the values that are already 0 unchanged. This produces the desired output.

Solution:
[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
