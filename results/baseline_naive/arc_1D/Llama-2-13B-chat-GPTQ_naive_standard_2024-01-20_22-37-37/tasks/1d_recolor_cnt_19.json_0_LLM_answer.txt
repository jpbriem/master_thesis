LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6]
output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 9. We can observe that the array has a cyclic structure, where each digit appears twice, except for the number 6 which appears three times. Our goal is to transform this array into another array such that the resulting array has no repeating digits.

To achieve this, we use a simple transformation technique based on the observation that each digit appears twice in the original array, except for the number 6. We keep track of the count of each digit in the original array and apply the appropriate transformations to ensure that each digit appears only once in the output array.

For example, consider the first test case:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]

We start by keeping track of the count of each digit in the array:

| Digit | Count |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 2 |
| 6 | 3 |
| other digits (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) | 0 |

Now, let's apply the transformation rule:

* For each occurrence of the digit 6, subtract 3 from its count. This is because each occurrence of 6 should be reduced by 3 to account for the fact that there are three 6s in the original array.
* For each occurrence of any other digit (i.e., not 6), increment its count by 1. This is because each occurrence of these digits should be increased by 1 to make up for the missing 6s.

After applying the transformation rule, we get the following updated counts:

| Digit | Count |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 2 |
| 6 | -3 |
| other digits (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) | 1 |

Finally, we convert the updated counts back into an integer array, and we get the desired output: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].

Similarly, we can handle the remaining test cases using the same approach.
