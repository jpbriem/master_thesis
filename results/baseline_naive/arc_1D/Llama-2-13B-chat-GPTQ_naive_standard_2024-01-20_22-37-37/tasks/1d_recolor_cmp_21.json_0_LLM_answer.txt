LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]

Example_2:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input element is either 0 or 8. We can divide the input into two parts: one part contains only 0s (the first half), and the other part contains only 8s (the second half). We can then apply a series of shifts and XOR operations to transform the input.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the transformation:

1. Shift the first half of the input (the 0s) by 1 bit to the left, so that all 0s become 1s. This creates a new sequence of ones.
2. XOR the new sequence of ones with the second half of the input (the 8s). This produces a new sequence where all 0s have been replaced by 8s, and vice versa.
3. Shift the new sequence by 1 bit to the right, so that all 8s become 0s. This creates the final output.

Note that the transformation is reversible, meaning that the original input can be recovered from the output by applying the same series of operations in reverse.

Solution:
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
