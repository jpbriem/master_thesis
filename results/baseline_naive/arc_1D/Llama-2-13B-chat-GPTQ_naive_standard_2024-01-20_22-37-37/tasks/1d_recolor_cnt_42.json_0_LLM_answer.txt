LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 9. We can observe that the elements in the array are either 0 or a power of 2 (i.e., 2^x).

Our goal is to transform this array into another array where each element is either 0 or a power of 2, but with a specific pattern. Specifically, we want to replace each element with its corresponding power of 2, except for the first element which should be 0.

To achieve this, we can use a simple transformation rule: for each element x in the input array, if x is not equal to 0, then replace it with 2^((x-1) mod 2). This rule works as follows:

* If x is 0, leave it unchanged.
* Otherwise (i.e., x is not 0), compute 2^(x-1) mod 2, which gives us either 0 or 1.
* Replace x with this result.

By applying this rule to each element in the input array, we get the desired output array.

Note that this problem is a classic example of a "transformation" problem, where we need to transform one array into another array using a specific rule. These types of problems are common in coding interviews and other programming challenges.
