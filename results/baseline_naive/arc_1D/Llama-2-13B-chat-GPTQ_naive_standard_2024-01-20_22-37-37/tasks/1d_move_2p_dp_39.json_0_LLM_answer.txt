LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 6, where each number appears exactly once. We can transform this array into another array by swapping adjacent elements if their difference is less than or equal to 1. This transformation preserves the property that each number appears exactly once in the resulting array.

For example, in Example_1, we swap the first two elements (0 and 6) because their difference is less than or equal to 1. Similarly, we swap the last two elements (6 and 6) because their difference is also less than or equal to 1. As a result, we get the output array [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0].

In Example_2, we only have one pair of adjacent elements (0 and 1), so we don't need to perform any swaps. The output array is simply [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In Example_3, we swap the first two elements (6 and 6) because their difference is less than or equal to 1. The output array is [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0].

In the test case, we swap the second and third elements (2 and 2) because their difference is less than or equal to 1. The output array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0].
