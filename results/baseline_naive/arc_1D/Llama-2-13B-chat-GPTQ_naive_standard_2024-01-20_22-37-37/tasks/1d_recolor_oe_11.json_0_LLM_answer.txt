LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 7, where each number appears exactly once. We can observe that the array has a cyclic structure, with each element being separated by a gap of either 0 or 7.

To transform the array into the desired output, we need to find the starting point of each cycle and then apply the appropriate transformation based on the position of the element in the cycle.

We can identify three types of cycles in the array:

1. Cycle of length 7: These cycles start at positions 0, 7, 14, and 21, and end at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Elements within these cycles have a gap of 7 between them.
2. Cycle of length 1: These cycles start at positions 7, 15, and 22, and end at positions 7, 15, and 22, respectively. Elements within these cycles have a gap of 0 between them.
3. Single elements: Positions 2, 8, 16, and 23 contain single elements.

Based on this analysis, we can create a transformation function that applies the following rules:

* For elements in cycles of length 7: Add 7 to the element value.
* For elements in cycles of length 1: Keep the element value unchanged.
* For single elements: Multiply the element value by 9.

Using this function, we can transform the input array as follows:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 9 |
| 7 | 9 |
| 7 | 9 |
| 7 | 9 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 9 |
| 7 | 9 |
| 7 | 9 |
| 0 | 0 |

As shown above, applying the transformation function to the input array produces the desired output.
