LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through the input array and keeping track of the number of consecutive elements that have the value 9. Whenever a non-9 element is encountered, the current count of consecutive 9s is added to the output array. If the current element is not 9, then the count of consecutive 9s is reset to 0.

For example, in Example_1, the input array contains several sequences of consecutive 9s, such as [9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], and [9]. The algorithm adds each of these sequences to the output array, resulting in the desired output.

In Example_2, the input array contains only one sequence of consecutive 9s, which spans the entire array. The algorithm adds this sequence to the output array, resulting in the desired output.

In Example_3, the input array contains multiple sequences of consecutive 9s, some of which span the entire array. The algorithm adds each of these sequences to the output array, resulting in the desired output.

In the test case, the input array contains several sequences of consecutive 9s, including [9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9], and [9]. The algorithm adds each of these sequences to the output array, resulting in the desired output.
