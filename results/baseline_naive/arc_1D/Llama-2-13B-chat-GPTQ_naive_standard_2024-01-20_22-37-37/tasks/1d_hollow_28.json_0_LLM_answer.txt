LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a sorted array of integers. We can observe that all the elements in the array are either 0 or a perfect square (i.e., an integer that can be expressed as the square of an integer). Therefore, we can apply the following observation: if an element is a perfect square, then it must be followed by another perfect square (since the only perfect squares less than 10 are 0, 1, 4, 9, and 16, and none of these numbers can be followed by another perfect square).

Based on this observation, we can design a simple algorithm to transform the input array into the output array. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Scan the input array from left to right and keep track of the current element and its previous element. If the current element is not a perfect square, do nothing and move on to the next element. If the current element is a perfect square, then it must be followed by another perfect square, so replace the current element with the previous element's square (i.e., the previous element squared).
2. After scanning the entire input array, the resulting array will contain only perfect squares, and they will be in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the output array for the given input array is [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
