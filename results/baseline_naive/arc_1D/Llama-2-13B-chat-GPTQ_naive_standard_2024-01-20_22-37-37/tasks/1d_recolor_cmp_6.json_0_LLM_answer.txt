LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers 0 to 9. We can observe that the digits are arranged in a zigzag pattern, where each digit is either 0 or 9. Our goal is to transform this array into another array where all the 0s are replaced by 5s.

To achieve this, we can use a simple transformation rule: for each digit x, if x = 0, then replace it with 5. Otherwise (i.e., if x!= 0), do not change the value of x. This rule ensures that all the 0s are replaced by 5s, while leaving the non-zero digits unchanged.

We can implement this rule using a loop that iterates over the input array. For each element x in the array, we check whether x == 0. If so, we replace it with 5. Otherwise, we leave it unchanged. At the end of the loop, we have transformed the input array into the output array, where all the 0s are replaced by 5s.

Solution:
[0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]
