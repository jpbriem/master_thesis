LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 2]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a combination of two arrays, one containing only 0s and 6s, and another containing only 0s and 5s. We can observe that all the elements in the array are either 0 or a multiple of 6 (6, 12, 18, etc.). Therefore, we can apply a simple transformation to the array by shifting all the elements by 6 positions to the left, effectively merging the two arrays into one. This transformation will result in all the 0s becoming 0s and all the 6s becoming 6s.

Note: In the test case, there are some repeated values, but they do not affect the outcome of the solution.
