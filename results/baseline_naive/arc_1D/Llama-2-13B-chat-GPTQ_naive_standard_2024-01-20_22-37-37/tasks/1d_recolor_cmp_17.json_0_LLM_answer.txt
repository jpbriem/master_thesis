LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Explanation of the transformation:
The transformation is based on the observation that each input element can be either 0 or 7. We define a new array with two elements: 0 and 7. Each input element is transformed by replacing it with its corresponding index in this new array (i.e., 0 becomes 0, and 7 becomes 7). This transformation preserves the relative positions of the elements in the original array.

For example, in Example_1, the input element [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0] is transformed into [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0].

In Example_2, the input element [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0] is transformed into [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0].

In Example_3, the input element [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0] is transformed into [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0].

In the test case, the input element [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] is transformed into [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0].
