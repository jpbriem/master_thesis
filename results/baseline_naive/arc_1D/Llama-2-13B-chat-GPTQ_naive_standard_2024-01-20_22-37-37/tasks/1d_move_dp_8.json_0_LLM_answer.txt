LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6]

Example_3:
input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a permutation of the numbers from 0 to 8. We can observe that all the elements in the array are either 0 or one of the numbers from 3 to 7 (inclusive). Therefore, we can transform the array by replacing each element with its corresponding number from the set {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

For example, for the input array [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6], we replace each element as follows:

* 3 becomes 0
* 3 becomes 3
* 3 becomes 4
* 3 becomes 5
* 3 becomes 6
* 0 becomes 7

Therefore, the transformed array is [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 6].
