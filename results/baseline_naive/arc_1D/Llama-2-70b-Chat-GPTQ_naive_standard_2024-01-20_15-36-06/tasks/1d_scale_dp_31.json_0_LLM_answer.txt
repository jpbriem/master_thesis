LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The function should take an array of integers as input and return an array of integers as output. The input array contains a sequence of zeroes and non-zeroes. The task is to replace all sequences of zeroes with the corresponding number of consecutive identical non-zero elements. For example, in the first input-output pair, there are three sequences of zeroes (of lengths 2, 2, and 1) which are replaced by their corresponding non-zero elements (2, 2, and 4). In the second input-output pair, there are four sequences of zeroes (of lengths 6, 6, 6, and 1) which are replaced by their corresponding non-zero elements (6, 6, 6, and 4).
Note that leading and trailing zeroes should be preserved. Also, if there are multiple sequences of zeroes of the same length, they should be replaced by the corresponding non-zero element.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]
