LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a simple one, replacing each number with its square (or the square of the number, whichever way you want to look at it). For example, in the first input-output pair, every digit is replaced by its square, so 0 becomes 0^2 = 0, 1 becomes 1^2 = 1, and 4 becomes 4^2 = 16.

In the second input-output pair, we have a different story. Every digit that is not equal to 5 is replaced by 0 (zero), while every digit that is equal to 5 remains unchanged. This can be seen as squaring every digit and then replacing all non-zero values with 0.

In the third input-output pair, we have another variation of the previous two. Every digit that is not equal to 2 or 5 is replaced by 0, while every digit that is equal to 2 or 5 remains unchanged. Again, this can be seen as squaring every digit and then replacing all non-2 and non-5 values with 0.

The test case is similar to the first input-output pair, where every digit is replaced by its square.
