LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The task is to find the longest sequence of consecutive 1's in the input array. The output should contain the starting index of the first 1 in the sequence, followed by the length of the sequence (in this case, it's always 6).
In Example_1, there are three sequences of consecutive 1's: [1, 1], [1, 1, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1]. The longest sequence has a length of 4, so the output would be [0, 4].
In Example_2, there are four sequences of consecutive 1's: [1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The longest sequence has a length of 5, so the output would be [0, 5].
In Example_3, there are five sequences of consecutive 1's: [1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The longest sequence has a length of 6, so the output would be [0, 6].
Note that the input array may contain trailing zeros, which shouldn't be considered when finding the longest sequence. Also, the output format is flexible; other formats that unambiguously represent the starting index and length of the longest sequence are acceptable as well.

Solution:
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
