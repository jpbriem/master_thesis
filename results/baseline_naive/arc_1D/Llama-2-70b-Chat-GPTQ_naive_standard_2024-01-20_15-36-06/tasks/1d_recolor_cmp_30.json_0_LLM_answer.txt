LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

Notice that in each example, there is a sequence of consecutive equal elements (all 3s or all 0s) followed by a single element that is different from the rest. The task is to replace this single element with the number of times it appears in the input sequence. For instance, in Example_1, the input sequence has three consecutive 3s, followed by a single 0, which is replaced by 4 (the number of times 3 appears before it). Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence has eight consecutive 3s, followed by two 0s, which are both replaced by 9 (the number of times 3 appears before them). In Example_3, there are multiple sequences of equal elements, but only the last one (with three 3s) contains a single element (a 0) that needs to be replaced.

Solution:
[0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]
