LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

The given input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by a sliding window of size 3. The window moves from left to right, and at each position, the maximum value in the window is selected as the output value for that position. If there are multiple maxima, the first one encountered is chosen.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. A sliding window of size 3 is applied to this sequence, and the resulting output sequence is [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In this case, the window starts at the first element of the input sequence, which has a value of 0. The second element is also 0, so the maximum value in the window is still 0. When we reach the third element, which has a value of 5, the maximum value in the window becomes 5. This continues until we reach the seventh element, which has a value of 5 again. Since the maximum value in the window is now 5, the output value for the seventh element is set to 8.

The window then shifts over to the next three elements, starting with the eighth element, which has a value of 5. The maximum value in the window is now 8, since we have already seen a 5 and an 8 in the previous window. When we reach the tenth element, which has a value of 5, the maximum value in the window becomes 8 again, since we have seen two 5s and an 8. This process continues until the end of the input sequence.
