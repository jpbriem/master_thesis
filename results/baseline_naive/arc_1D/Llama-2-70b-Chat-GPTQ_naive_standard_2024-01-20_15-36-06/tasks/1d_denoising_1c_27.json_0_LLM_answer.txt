LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]

The transformation is a simple one. For each group of five consecutive elements in the input array that have the same value (either all 0 or all non-zero), replace them with a single occurrence of that value. If there are fewer than five consecutive elements with the same value at the end of the array, leave them unchanged.

For example, in Example_1, the first five elements are all 0, so they are replaced by a single 0. The next five elements are all 5, so they are replaced by a single 5. The remaining elements are all 0, so they are left unchanged. The resulting output array has only three elements: two 0s and a 5.

In Example_2, the first five elements are all 0, so they are replaced by a single 0. The next three elements are all 3, so they are replaced by a single 3. The remaining elements are all 0, so they are left unchanged. The resulting output array has only four elements: three 0s and a 3.

In Example_3, the first five elements are all 0, so they are replaced by a single 0. The next six elements are all 6, so they are replaced by a single 6. The remaining elements are all 0, so they are left unchanged. The resulting output array has only four elements: three 0s and a 6.

Note that the test case includes several groups of consecutive elements with the same value, and some groups have more than five elements. However, the transformation still applies to each group of five consecutive elements independently.
