LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation pattern is as follows:
* Each group of four consecutive zeroes in the input corresponds to a single zero in the output.
* Each non-zero element in the input corresponds to a sequence of three consecutive equal elements in the output (either all zeroes or all ones).
* The number of such sequences in the output is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding position in the input.
* All zeroes in the input that do not form groups of four consecutive zeroes correspond to single zeroes in the output.

For example, in Example_1, there are two groups of four consecutive zeroes in the input, which correspond to two single zeroes in the output. There are also five non-zero elements in the input, each of which corresponds to a sequence of three consecutive equal elements in the output - three zeroes followed by two ones. Similarly, in Example_2, there are three groups of four consecutive zeroes in the input, which correspond to three single zeroes in the output. There are also seven non-zero elements in the input, each of which corresponds to a sequence of three consecutive equal elements in the output - three zeroes followed by four ones. In Example_3, there are four groups of four consecutive zeroes in the input, which correspond to four single zeroes in the output. There are also nine non-zero elements in the input, each of which corresponds to a sequence of three consecutive equal elements in the output - four zeroes followed by five ones.
