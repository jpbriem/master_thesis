LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first but once you see it, it's quite simple. The idea is that each group of four consecutive zeroes in the input array corresponds to a single zero in the output array. The remaining elements in the input array correspond to the number of ones that should be placed between these groups of zeros.
For example, in the first input array, there are three groups of four consecutive zeroes (marked by square brackets), corresponding to three zeroes in the output array. Between the first two groups, there are four ones (marked by round parentheses), which means we should place four ones between the first two zeroes in the output array. Similarly, between the second and third groups, there are four ones again, so we place four more ones between the second and third zeroes in the output array. Finally, there are no ones left over after the last group of zeroes, so we just pad the rest of the output array with zeroes.
In general, if an input array has n groups of four consecutive zeroes, the corresponding output array will have n zeroes, separated by runs of ones whose lengths are given by the numbers of ones between the groups of zeroes. If there are m ones left over after placing the last group of zeroes, then the final m elements of the output array will be zeroes.
