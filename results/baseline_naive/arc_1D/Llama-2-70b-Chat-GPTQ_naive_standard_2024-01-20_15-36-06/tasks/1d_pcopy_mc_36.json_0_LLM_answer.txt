LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The task is to find a pattern in the input-output pairs and implement the same using Python code.
The pattern observed in the input-output pairs is:
For every occurrence of a number (except zero) in the input array, the corresponding position in the output array contains the maximum value among all numbers that occur before it in the input array. If there are multiple such occurrences, then the maximum value among them is chosen.
In other words, if we encounter a non-zero element x in the input array, we look for the maximum value among all elements less than or equal to x that have occurred before x in the input array. We then place this maximum value at the position of x in the output array.
If there are no non-zero elements before x, then we place x itself at its own position in the output array.
Note that zero is treated as a special case. When we encounter a zero in the input array, we simply copy it to the corresponding position in the output array without looking for any maximum value. This can be done because zero is always less than or equal to any positive integer.
Therefore, the output array is a modified version of the input array where each non-zero element has been replaced by the maximum value among all elements less than or equal to it that have occurred before it in the input array.
