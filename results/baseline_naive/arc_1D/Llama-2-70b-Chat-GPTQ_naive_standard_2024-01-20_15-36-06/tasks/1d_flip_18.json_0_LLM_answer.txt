LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Notice that in each example, all occurrences of a specific value (in this case, 4, 2, or 7) have been replaced by the next highest occurrence of that value. For instance, in Example_1, all instances of 4 have been replaced with 5 because there is no higher occurrence of 4 after it appears for the first time. Similarly, in Example_2, all instances of 2 have been replaced with 2 because there is no higher occurrence of 2 after it appears for the first time. In Example_3, all instances of 3 have been replaced with 3 because there is no higher occurrence of 3 after it appears for the first time. Finally, in the test case, all instances of 7 have been replaced with 1 because there is no higher occurrence of 7 after it appears for the first time.

The task at hand is to write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array according to the above pattern.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 0]
