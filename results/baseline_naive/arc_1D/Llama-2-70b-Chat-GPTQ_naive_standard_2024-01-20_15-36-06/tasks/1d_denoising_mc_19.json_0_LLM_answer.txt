LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The function applies a specific transformation to the input array, which is repeated application of the following steps:

1. Find the first occurrence of the number 3 in the input array (or the first occurrence of a number greater than 0 if there are no threes).
2. Replace all occurrences of 0 before this number with 3.
3. Replace all occurrences of 3 after this number with 5.
4. If the number found in step 1 is not 3, replace it with 4.
5. Return the modified array.

In the first example, the first occurrence of 3 is at index 5, so all zeros before index 5 are replaced with 3, and all threes after index 5 are replaced with 5. The number 3 at index 5 is not changed because it's already equal to 3. The resulting array has the same length as the original array but with all zeros replaced with 3 and all threes replaced with 5.

In the second example, the first occurrence of 3 is at index 5 again, but this time all zeros before index 5 are already replaced with 3, so the transformation doesn't change anything before index 5. All threes after index 5 are still replaced with 5 though.

In the third example, the first occurrence of 3 is at index 7, so all zeros before index 7 are replaced with 3, and all threes after index 7 are replaced with 5. Additionally, the number 1 at index 9 is replaced with 4 since it's not 3.

The test case is just another example of applying the same transformation to a different input array.

[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
