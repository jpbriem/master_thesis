LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0]
output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]

The given input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by a sliding window of size 4. The window is shifted by 1 element at a time, and for each position, the maximum value in the window is selected as the output value. If there are equal maxima, the leftmost one is chosen.
For example, for the first input sequence, the output sequence would be:
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

In this solution, we use a sliding window of size 4 to scan through the input array and find the maximum value in the window at each position. We keep track of the current maximum value and its index using a variable'max' and a list'max_index'. When we encounter a new maximum value, we update'max' and'max_index' accordingly. At each position, we select the maximum value in the window as the output value. If there are equal maxima, we choose the leftmost one.
Note that the window size is a parameter that can be adjusted based on the specific problem statement. In general, a larger window size may allow for more efficient computation but may also lead to less accurate results if the input sequence contains local maxima or discontinuities.
