LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The first line of each pair is the input array, and the second line is the expected output array. Note that in all three examples, the input arrays have a length of 16, while the output arrays have a length of 15. This is because the last element of the input array is always zero, and it is ignored when creating the output array.
In Example 1, the input array contains only zeros and fours. The output array has only zeros and fours as well, with the same number of zeros and fours as the input array. In Example 2, the input array contains only zeros and fours, but with a different distribution than in Example 1. Again, the output array has only zeros and fours, with the same number of zeros and fours as the input array. In Example 3, the input array contains only threes and zeros. The output array has only threes and zeros as well, with the same number of threes and zeros as the input array.
The test case provided is similar to Example 1. The input array contains only zeros and sevens. The output array should contain only zeros and sevens as well, with the same number of zeros and sevens as the input array.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
