LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]
Notice that in all three examples, the output has a total of 4 '2's. Also, observe that the number of '9's in the input is always equal to the number of '9's in the output.
The task is to write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array.

Constraints:

1 <= length of input array <= 50

0 <= value of any element in the input array <= 9

The output array will have the same length as the input array.

Solution:
[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9]
