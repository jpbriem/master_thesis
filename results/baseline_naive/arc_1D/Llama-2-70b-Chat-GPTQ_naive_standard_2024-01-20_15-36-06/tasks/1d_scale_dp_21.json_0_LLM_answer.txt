LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0]

Test case:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Notice that in all of these examples, the output is simply a modified version of the input with all occurrences of the number 7 (or 5, or 6) replaced by 8. This suggests that the function is performing some kind of substitution cipher, where each occurrence of a certain number (called the "key") is replaced by another number (called the "cipher"). In this case, it appears that the key is 7, and the cipher is 8.

To generalize this pattern to other inputs, we can define a function f(x) = y, where x is an integer between 0 and 7 (inclusive), and y is the corresponding output value. Based on the examples given, we have:
f(7) = 8
f(5) = 8
f(6) = 8
It's worth noting that f(0) = 0, since zero is a special case that doesn't get replaced by anything.
Now, let's consider how we might extend this function to handle larger integers. One way to do this would be to use modular arithmetic, which allows us to wrap around the range of values when we reach the end. Specifically, we could define f(x) = y as follows:
f(x) = (x + 7) mod 8
This formula takes the input x, adds 7 to it (which effectively wraps around to 0 when x is 7), and then computes the remainder when divided by 8. This gives us a result that cycles through the set {0, 1, 2,..., 7} as x increases, which means that every eighth input value will produce the same output value.
For example, using this formula, we have:
f(7) = (7 + 7) mod 8 = 14 mod 8 = 6
f(5) = (5 + 7) mod 8 = 12 mod 8 = 4
f(6) = (6 + 7) mod 8 = 13 mod 8 = 5
In each case, we get a different output value, but they all follow the same pattern of cycling through the set {0, 1, 2,..., 7}.
Therefore, the final answer for the function f(x) = y with the given constraints is:
f(x) = (x + 7) mod 8

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
