LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0]

The transformation pattern is as follows:
* If there are no 9s in the input, the output will have a single 0.
* Otherwise, consider the first non-zero element of the input (call it x).
* There will be exactly x-1 zeroes before the first occurrence of 9 in the input.
* All occurrences of 9 in the input will be replaced by the corresponding number of zeroes in the output.
* After replacing all occurrences of 9, there may still be some zeroes left in the output. These should be replaced with the number of zeroes that appeared between the last occurrence of 9 and the end of the input.

Notice that the test case has several consecutive 9s at the end. This is to ensure that the correct number of zeroes is produced after replacing the last occurrence of 9.

Solution:
[0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 0]
