LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is done by shifting the elements in the array to the right by a certain number of positions, then filling up the resulting gaps with zeros. The number of positions to shift is determined by the largest element in the array, which is moved to the first position. All other elements are moved to the right by the same number of positions. If there are multiple maxima, they are all moved to the first position.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the largest element is 4, so it is moved to the first position, and all other elements are moved to the right by 3 positions. In the second input-output pair, the largest element is 7, so it is moved to the first position, and all other elements are moved to the right by 6 positions.

Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array.
