LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive equal elements in the input array and replace all occurrences of that element with the maximum number of consecutive equal elements. If there are multiple such sequences, the maximum sequence should be replaced first, followed by the next maximum sequence and so on.
In the above examples, the input arrays have been transformed into the output arrays by replacing consecutive equal elements with the maximum number of consecutive equal elements. In Example_1, the maximum sequence is 8, which occurs 5 times consecutively, so it is replaced by 5. Similarly, in Example_2, the maximum sequence is 4, which occurs 3 times consecutively, so it is replaced by 3. In Example_3, the maximum sequence is 8, which occurs 4 times consecutively, so it is replaced by 4. Note that in each example, all occurrences of the maximum sequence are replaced, not just the first one.
