LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive equal elements in the input array and replace them with a single element having value equal to the sum of all the elements in that range.
For example, in the first input-output pair, there are three consecutive equal elements (7) starting from index 3. So, we replace these three elements with a single element having value 21 (i.e., 7 + 7 + 7). Similarly, there are four consecutive equal elements (7) starting from index 8, so we replace them with a single element having value 28 (i.e., 7 + 7 + 7 + 7).
In the second input-output pair, there are two consecutive equal elements (7) starting from index 3, followed by another set of three consecutive equal elements (7) starting from index 6. We replace both sets of equal elements with a single element each having values 14 (i.e., 7 + 7) and 21 (i.e., 7 + 7 + 7), respectively.
In the third input-output pair, there are three consecutive equal elements (7) starting from index 3, followed by a single element (0) at index 6, then another set of three consecutive equal elements (7) starting from index 7. We replace the first set of equal elements with a single element having value 21 (i.e., 7 + 7 + 7), and the second set of equal elements with a single element having value 21 (i.e., 7 + 7 + 7).
Note that if there are multiple sets of consecutive equal elements in the input array, we need to replace each set separately. Also, note that some inputs may have leading or trailing zeros, which should be ignored while applying the transformation.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
