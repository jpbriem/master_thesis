LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first, but once you see the pattern, it's quite straightforward. The basic idea is that each element in the input array is either zero or non-zero. If an element is non-zero, it means that position in the output array should have a one in it. Otherwise, it should have a zero.

So, for example, in the first input-output pair, we have four non-zero elements (4, 4, 4, 4) which correspond to positions 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the output array. Since there are no other non-zero elements in the input array, the remaining positions in the output array should be filled with zeros.

In the second input-output pair, we have three non-zero elements (5, 5, 5) which correspond to positions 2, 3, and 4 in the output array. There is also a single zero in the input array at position 6, so the corresponding position in the output array should be zero as well. Finally, there are two additional non-zero elements (9, 0) at the end of the input array, which don't affect the output array because they are not in the range of positions 0..4.

Your task is to write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array according to the above rules. You can assume that the input array will always have at least one non-zero element.
