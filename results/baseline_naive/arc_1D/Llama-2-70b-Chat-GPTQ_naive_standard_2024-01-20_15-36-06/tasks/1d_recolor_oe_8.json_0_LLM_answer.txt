LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Notice that in each example, there is a sequence of consecutive equal elements (all 0s or all 9s) followed by a single element that is different from the rest. The task is to replace this single element with the number of times it appears consecutively. For instance, in Example_1, the input sequence has three consecutive 0s, followed by a single 9, which is replaced by 3 (the number of consecutive 0s). Then, there are three consecutive 9s, followed by a single 0, which is replaced by 3 again. And so on.
The given Test case represents one possible sequence of inputs and expected outputs for this problem.

Solution:
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]
