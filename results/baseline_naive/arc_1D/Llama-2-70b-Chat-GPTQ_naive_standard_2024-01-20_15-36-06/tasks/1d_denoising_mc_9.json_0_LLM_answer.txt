LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The function applies a specific transformation to the input array, which is repeated application of the following steps:

1. Find the first occurrence of the number 7 in the input array (or the first occurrence of a number greater than 0 if there are no 7s).
2. Replace all occurrences of that number with 7.
3. Shift all elements after the replaced element by one position to the right.
4. If the shifted element is now at the end of the array, remove it.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until there are no more occurrences of the current number.

For example, in the first input-output pair, the first occurrence of 7 is found at index 1. All occurrences of 7 are replaced with 7, shifting everything to the right. Since the shifted element at index 7 is now at the end of the array, it is removed. This process continues until there are no more occurrences of 7, resulting in the output array [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7].

In the second input-output pair, the first occurrence of 9 is found at index 4. All occurrences of 9 are replaced with 9, shifting everything to the right. Since the shifted element at index 9 is not at the end of the array, it is not removed. This process continues until there are no more occurrences of 9, resulting in the output array [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In the third input-output pair, the first occurrence of 5 is found at index 0. All occurrences of 5 are replaced with 5, shifting everything to the right. Since the shifted element at index 5 is not at the end of the array, it is not removed. This process continues until there are no more occurrences of 5, resulting in the output array [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In the test case, the first occurrence of 3 is found at index 3. All occurrences of 3 are replaced with 3, shifting everything to the right. Since the shifted element at index 6 is not at the end of the array, it is not removed. This process continues until there are no more occurrences of 3, resulting in the output array [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
