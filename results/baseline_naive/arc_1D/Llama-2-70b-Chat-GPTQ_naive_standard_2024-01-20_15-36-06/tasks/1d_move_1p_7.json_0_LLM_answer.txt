LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

Expected output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation pattern is to replace all occurrences of a digit with the maximum value among all digits in the input array that are less than or equal to the current position. For example, in the first input array [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], we start by comparing each element with its predecessors (in this case, there are no predecessors since it's the first element), so the first '3' remains unchanged. Then, when we encounter the second '3', we compare it with the previous elements (which are all less than or equal to the current position) and find that it has the maximum value among them, so we replace the second '3' with the maximum value, which is also '3'. We continue this process until the end of the array, replacing each element with the maximum value found among its predecessors.

Write a function that takes an integer array as input and returns the transformed array according to the described pattern.
