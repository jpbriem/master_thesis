LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The function should take an array of integers as input and return an array of integers as output. The function should iterate through each element in the input array and if the current element is equal to 0 it should be replaced with the value of the next element in the array. If the current element is not equal to 0 it should be left unchanged. The function should continue this process until the end of the array is reached.
For example, in the first test case, the input array contains a sequence of 0s and 6s. When the function encounters a 0 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 6. This continues until the end of the array where the last 0 is replaced with a 6 resulting in the output array containing only 6s.
In the second test case, the input array contains a sequence of 0s and 7s. When the function encounters a 0 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 7. This continues until the end of the array where the last 0 is replaced with a 7 resulting in the output array containing only 7s.
In the third test case, the input array contains a sequence of 0s, 3s, and 4s. When the function encounters a 0 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 3. Then when the function encounters a 3 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 4. This continues until the end of the array where the last 0 is replaced with a 4 resulting in the output array containing only 4s.
In the test case, the input array contains a sequence of 0s, 3s, 5s, and 6s. When the function encounters a 0 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 3. Then when the function encounters a 3 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 5. Then when the function encounters a 5 it replaces it with the value of the next element which is a 6. This continues until the end of the array where the last 0 is replaced with a 6 resulting in the output array containing only 6s.
