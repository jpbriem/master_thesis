LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0]

Notice that in each example, all occurrences of a digit are replaced by its rightmost occurrence in the input array. For instance, in Example_1, all occurrences of 8 are replaced by the last occurrence of 8, which is at index 15. Similarly, in Example_2, all occurrences of 1 are replaced by the last occurrence of 1, which is at index 9. In Example_3, all occurrences of 4 are replaced by the last occurrence of 4, which is at index 12. Finally, in the test case, all occurrences of 1 are replaced by the last occurrence of 1, which is at index 6.

Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array applying the above rule.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0]
