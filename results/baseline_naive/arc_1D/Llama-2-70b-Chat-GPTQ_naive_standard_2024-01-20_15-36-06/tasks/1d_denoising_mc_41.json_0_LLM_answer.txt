LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The task is to find a specific pattern in the given array of integers. The pattern is as follows:

* There may be some leading zeroes (0) at the beginning of the array.
* Then, there should be exactly 9 consecutive equal elements (either all 7 or all 9).
* After that, there may be some trailing zeroes (0) at the end of the array.

The function should return an array with the same structure as the input, but with all elements changed to either 7 or 9, depending on their position in the array. All leading and trailing zeroes should be preserved. Only the consecutive equal elements in the middle should be replaced according to the pattern described above.

In the first example, the input array has 16 elements. It starts with 15 zeroes, then there are 9 consecutive equal elements (all 9), and finally, there are 4 more zeroes at the end. The output array should have the same structure - 15 zeroes, then 9 consecutive elements with value 7 (since all 9's were replaced by 7), and 4 more zeroes at the end.

In the second example, the input array has 17 elements. It starts with 7 zeroes, then there are 9 consecutive equal elements (all 7), and finally, there are 3 more zeroes at the end. The output array should have the same structure - 7 zeroes, then 9 consecutive elements with value 7 (since all 7's were replaced by 7), and 3 more zeroes at the end.

In the third example, the input array has 19 elements. It starts with 15 zeroes, then there are 7 consecutive equal elements (all 7), then there is one element with value 6 (which should not be replaced since it's not part of the consecutive equal elements), then there are 7 more consecutive equal elements (all 7), and finally, there are 4 more zeroes at the end. The output array should have the same structure - 15 zeroes, then 7 consecutive elements with value 7, then the single element with value 6, then 7 more consecutive elements with value 7, and 4 more zeroes at the end.

In the test case, the input array has 21 elements. It starts with 4 zeroes, then there are 2 consecutive equal elements (both 2), then there are 9 consecutive equal elements (all 9), then there are 2 more consecutive equal elements (both 2), and finally, there are 4 more zeroes at the end. The output array should have the same structure - 4 zeroes, then 2 consecutive elements with value 7 (since both 2's were replaced by 7), then 9 consecutive elements with value 7 (since all 9's were replaced by 7), then 2 more consecutive elements with value 7 (since both 2's were replaced by 7), and 4 more zeroes at the end.
