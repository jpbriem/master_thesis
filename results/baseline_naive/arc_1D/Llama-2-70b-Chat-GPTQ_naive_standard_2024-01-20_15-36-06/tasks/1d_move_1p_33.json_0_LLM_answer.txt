LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a simple one. For each group of identical elements in the input array, replace all elements with their first occurrence. This can be done using a hash table to keep track of unique values and their corresponding indices.

For example, in the first input array [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], we start by initializing an empty hash table. When we encounter the first 0, we assign it the index 0. When we encounter the first 2, we assign it the index 1. We then replace all subsequent occurrences of 0 with 0 (since they already have an assigned index) and all subsequent occurrences of 2 with 1. The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In the second input array [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], we follow the same process. We initialize an empty hash table, and when we encounter the first 0, we assign it the index 0. When we encounter the first 6, we assign it the index 1. We then replace all subsequent occurrences of 0 with 0 and all subsequent occurrences of 6 with 1. The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In the third input array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we again initialize an empty hash table. When we encounter the first 0, we assign it the index 0. When we encounter the first 6, we assign it the index 1. We then replace all subsequent occurrences of 0 with 0 and all subsequent occurrences of 6 with 1. The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Note that the order of the unique values in the output array does not matter, as long as all equal elements are replaced with their first occurrence. Also, the input array may contain duplicates of different values, but the output array will only contain each value once.
