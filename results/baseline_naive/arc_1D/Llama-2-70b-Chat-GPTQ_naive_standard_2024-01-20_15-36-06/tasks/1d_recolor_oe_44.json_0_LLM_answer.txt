LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first but once you see it, it's quite simple. The idea is that each digit in the input array represents a "block" of length 3. For example, the first block is [0, 0, 0], the second block is [7, 7, 7], etc.

What we need to do is shift these blocks by a certain amount so that all the zeroes are pushed together and all the non-zero values are pushed together. The amount of shifting required can be calculated by looking at the first non-zero value in each block. If the first non-zero value in a block is at index i, then we need to shift the entire block by i positions to the right.

For example, in the first input array given above, the first non-zero value is at index 4 (the fifth element is 7), so we need to shift the first four elements by 4 positions to the right. This effectively creates a "hole" of size 4 at the beginning of the array, which we then fill up with zeros.

Similarly, for the second input array, the first non-zero value is at index 2 (the third element is 7), so we need to shift the first two elements by 2 positions to the right. This creates a hole of size 2 at the beginning of the array, which we fill up with zeros.

In general, the amount of shifting required will depend on the position of the first non-zero value in each block. We can calculate this amount by taking the minimum of the indices of all non-zero values in each block, and then adding some constant to make sure that all holes are properly aligned.

Once we have shifted all the blocks by the appropriate amount, we just need to fill up any remaining holes with zeros and return the resulting array as output.
