LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]

The given input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by replacing each occurrence of three or more consecutive equal elements with the corresponding number of occurrences of the next element in the sequence. For example, in the first input sequence, the first seven 7's are replaced by eight 8's (since there are eight consecutive equal elements), followed by a single 7 (which is not part of any group of three or more consecutive equal elements). Similarly, the second group of seven 7's is replaced by nine 9's (since there are nine consecutive equal elements), and so on. Note that if there are fewer than three consecutive equal elements at the end of the input sequence, they should simply be copied to the output sequence unchanged.

Solution:
[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7]
