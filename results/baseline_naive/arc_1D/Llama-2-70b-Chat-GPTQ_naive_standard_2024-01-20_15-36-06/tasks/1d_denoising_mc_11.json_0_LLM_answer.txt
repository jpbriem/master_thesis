LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The function applies a specific transformation to the input array, which can be described by the following rules:

1. If the current element is equal to 0, then replace it with 7.
2. If the current element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 8, then leave it unchanged.
3. If the current element is greater than 8, then replace it with 1.
4. If the current element is equal to 7, then leave it unchanged.

The function applies these rules iteratively to each element in the input array, starting from the first element. Therefore, the output array will have the same length as the input array, and each element in the output array will be either 0, 7, 1, or 8, depending on the corresponding element in the input array.

In all three examples provided, the input arrays have at least one element that satisfies the condition for rule 1 (equal to 0), and at most one element that satisfies the condition for rule 3 (greater than 8). Additionally, there are no elements in the input arrays that satisfy the condition for rule 2 (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 8). Therefore, the output arrays will only contain elements that satisfy the conditions for rules 1 and 3, which means they will only contain elements that are either 0, 7, 1, or 8.

The test case provided also follows this pattern, where all elements in the input array satisfy the conditions for either rule 1 or rule 3, resulting in an output array containing only elements that satisfy those rules.
