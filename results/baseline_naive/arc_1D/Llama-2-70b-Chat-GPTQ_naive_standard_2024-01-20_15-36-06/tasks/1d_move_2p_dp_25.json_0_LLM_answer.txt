LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0]

Notice that in all three examples, the output is simply a modified version of the input, where all occurrences of the number 2 (or 6, or 8) have been replaced by the number 0. This suggests that the function we're trying to find is simply replacing certain numbers in the input array with 0.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the maximum length of a prefix of the input array that ends at index i and contains no occurrence of the number j. We can compute dp as follows:

* dp[0][0] = 1, since the empty prefix has length 1 and does not contain any numbers.
* For each j from 1 to 9, dp[0][j] = 0, since the empty prefix cannot contain any number greater than 0.
* For each i from 1 to n (where n is the length of the input array), we can compute dp[i][j] as the maximum of:
	+ dp[i-1][j], if the ith element of the input array is not equal to j;
	+ dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, if the ith element of the input array is equal to j.

Intuitively, the recurrence relation says that the maximum length of a prefix that ends at index i and contains no occurrence of the number j is either the maximum length of a prefix that ends at index i-1 and contains no occurrence of the number j (if the ith element is not equal to j), or the maximum length of a prefix that ends at index i-1 and contains no occurrence of the number j-1 (if the ith element is equal to j). In the latter case, we add 1 to the maximum length because we have found a new occurrence of the number j.

The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n\*9), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(n\*9), where n is the length of the input array.
