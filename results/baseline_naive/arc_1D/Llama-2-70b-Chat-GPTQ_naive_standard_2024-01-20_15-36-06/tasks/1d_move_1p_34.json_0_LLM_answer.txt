LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

Expected output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this example, we have a list of numbers that contains some zeroes and some non-zero values. The task is to replace all occurrences of consecutive equal elements with a single instance of that element, while maintaining the order of the original list. In other words, if there are multiple instances of the same value in a row, they should be replaced with just one occurrence of that value.
The input and expected output show three different input-output pairings that illustrate this concept. For example, in the first input array, all elements are zero, so the output remains unchanged. In the second input array, there are several instances of the number two scattered throughout the list; these are replaced by a single occurrence of two in the corresponding positions in the output array. Similarly, in the third input array, all instances of eight are replaced by a single occurrence of eight in the output array. Finally, in the test case provided, the input array contains several instances of eight followed by several zeros; the output array has a single occurrence of eight followed by several zeros.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
