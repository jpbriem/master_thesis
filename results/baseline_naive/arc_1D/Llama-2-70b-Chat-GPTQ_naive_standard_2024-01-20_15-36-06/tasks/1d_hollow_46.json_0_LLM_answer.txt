LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The task is to write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array.

Write a code that can solve the problem.

My approach:
I tried to solve this problem by creating a hash table that maps the occurrence of each element in the input array to its position in the output array. Then I iterate through the input array and for each element, I check if it exists in the hash table, if it does I return the position of that element in the output array, otherwise, I add the element to the hash table and return its position in the output array.

But my solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(n), which is not efficient enough.

Can someone help me optimize my solution or provide a better solution?

Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This is a classic example of a "run-length encoding" problem. Your current approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(n), but there are more efficient ways to solve this problem.

One optimized solution is to use a data structure called a "sliding window". A sliding window is a fixed-size buffer that moves through the input array, keeping track of the maximum number of consecutive equal elements seen so far. When the window reaches the end of the input array, the maximum number of consecutive equal elements seen is returned as the answer.

Here's how you could implement this solution:

1. Initialize a sliding window of size k (where k is the maximum number of equal elements seen consecutively in the input array). Let's call the window 'w'.
2. Set a variable'max_seen' to 0, which will keep track of the maximum number of consecutive equal elements seen so far.
3. Iterate through the input array 'a' from left to right. For each element 'a[i]', do the following:
a. If 'a[i]' is equal to the last element of the window 'w', move the window 'w' one position to the right, and set'max_seen' to the maximum of'max_seen' and the length of the current run (i.e., the number of consecutive equal elements seen so far).
b. Otherwise, reset the window 'w' to an empty window of size k, and set'max_seen' to 0.
4. Return'max_seen' as the answer.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), since we only need to look at each element in the input array once. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the maximum number of equal elements seen consecutively in the input array. In the worst case, k = n, so the overall space complexity is still O(n).

Your sample input and output are a good test case for this problem. Here's how the algorithm would work on your input:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 |

| 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |

In this example, the maximum number of
