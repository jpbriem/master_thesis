LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

In this problem, we need to find a way to transform the input array in such a way that all occurrences of a specific value (in this case, 6) are replaced with another value (in this case, 0), while maintaining the order of the other elements in the array.
The given examples show that the transformation should be done in a cyclic manner, meaning that when the end of the array is reached, the next element to be transformed should be the first element of the array.

To summarize, the task is to write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the transformed array where all occurrences of a specific value have been replaced with another value, maintaining the original order of the other elements in the array.

Solution:
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
