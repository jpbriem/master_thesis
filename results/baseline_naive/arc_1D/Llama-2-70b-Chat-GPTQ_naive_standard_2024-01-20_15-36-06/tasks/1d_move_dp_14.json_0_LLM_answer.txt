LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 0]

Notice that in all three examples, the output is simply a shifted version of the input, where all zeroes are moved to the beginning of the array, followed by the rest of the elements in their original order. This transformation can be achieved by using a simple loop that shifts the elements of the input array to the left (or right) by a certain number of positions, depending on the specific example.

In the first example, the input array has 19 elements, and the output array has 20 elements (including the additional zero at the end). To transform the input into the output, we need to shift the elements 6 positions to the left, so that all zeroes become consecutive and appear at the beginning of the array.

In the second example, the input array has 17 elements, and the output array also has 17 elements (without any extra zeros added at the end). To transform the input into the output, we need to shift the elements 3 positions to the left, so that all zeroes become consecutive and appear at the beginning of the array.

In the third example, the input array has 14 elements, and the output array has 15 elements (including the additional zero at the end). To transform the input into the output, we need to shift the elements 5 positions to the left, so that all zeroes become consecutive and appear at the beginning of the array.

The general rule for this transformation seems to be that we need to shift the elements by a number of positions equal to the number of zeroes in the input array, divided by 2 (rounded up). If the number of zeroes is odd, we add an extra zero to the end of the output array to maintain the correct ordering.

Therefore, given an input array of size n, we can create the corresponding output array of size n+1 (or n, if there are no zeroes in the input) by shifting the elements by (n-1)/2 positions to the left (or right), depending on whether the number of zeroes is even or odd, respectively.
