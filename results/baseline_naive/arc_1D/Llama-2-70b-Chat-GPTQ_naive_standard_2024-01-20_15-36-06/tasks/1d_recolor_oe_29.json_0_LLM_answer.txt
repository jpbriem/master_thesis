LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Notice that in all three examples, the output values are simply shifted by one position to the right compared to the input values. In other words, each output value is equal to the corresponding input value shifted by one position to the left. This transformation can be represented mathematically as follows:
f(x) = x + 1 (mod 8)
where f(x) represents the output value for a given input value x.
The modulo operation ensures that the output values wrap around when they reach the end of the eight-element cycle. For example, if we apply this function to the input value 7, we get f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8, which wraps around to 0 since we are working modulo 8. Similarly, applying this function to the input value 0 results in f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1, which also wraps around to 0.
In summary, the task at hand involves determining whether a given input sequence contains at least one occurrence of the pattern 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, where the input values are treated as elements of a cyclic group of order 8 under the modulo operation.
