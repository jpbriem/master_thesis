LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 9, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

In this problem, we need to find a way to transform the input array in such a way that all occurrences of a single number (in this case, 7, 6, or 5) become equal to each other and greater than any other number in the array. Then, we need to return the transformed array as output.
The given input-output pairs show us how the transformation should work for different test cases. We can observe that in each example, all instances of a particular number (7, 6, or 5) are replaced with the maximum value among them. For instance, in Example_1, all instances of 7 are replaced with 7 itself because it is already the maximum value among all elements in the array. Similarly, in Example_2, all instances of 6 are replaced with 6 itself because it is the maximum value among all elements in the array. In Example_3, all instances of 5 are replaced with 5 itself because it is the maximum value among all elements in the array. Lastly, in the Test case, all instances of 4 are replaced with 4 itself because it is the maximum value among all elements in the array.
Therefore, to solve this problem, we need to write code that can identify the maximum value among all elements in an array and replace all instances of a single number with that maximum value.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
