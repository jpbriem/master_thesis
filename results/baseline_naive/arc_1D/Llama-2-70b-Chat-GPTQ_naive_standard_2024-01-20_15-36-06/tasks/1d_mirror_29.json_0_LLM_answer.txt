LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first, but once you see it, it's quite simple. The basic idea is that each digit in the input array is either zero or nonzero. If it's zero, we leave it alone. If it's nonzero, we replace it with a copy of the last nonzero digit that appeared before it in the array (or the first nonzero digit if there isn't one). So in the first example, the first three digits are zero, so they stay zero. The fourth digit is nonzero, so it gets replaced by a copy of the first nonzero digit (which happens to be the third digit), which is also nonzero. And so on.

It's worth noting that this problem is an excellent exercise for practicing your understanding of bit manipulation and shifting. It might be helpful to write some helper functions to perform these operations more easily.
