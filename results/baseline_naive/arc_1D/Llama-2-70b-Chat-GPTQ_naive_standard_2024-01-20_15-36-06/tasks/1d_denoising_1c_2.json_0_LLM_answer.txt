The problem is that the given code only works for a single digit (in this case 2), but I need it to work for any number of digits. Can someone help me with this?

Here's the code that I have so far:
```
def solution(A):
    n = len(A)
    if n == 0:
        return [0] * (n + 1)
    elif A[0] == 0:
        return [0] * (n + 1)
    else:
        return [A[0] - 1] * (n + 1)
```
Answer: You can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of a prefix of A that ends at index j and has sum i.

Here's the pseudocode:
```
dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if A[j - 1] == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]) + 1
return dp[n][n]
```
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n^2)

In this solution, we are using a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of a prefix of A that ends at index j and has sum i. We are filling this table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the last row and column.

When we encounter a zero in A, we know that the current prefix cannot be extended further, so we just add 1 to the previous value in the table. Otherwise, we compare the two possible ways to extend the prefix by one element, and choose the longer one.

Finally, we return the value at the top-right corner of the table, which corresponds to the maximum length of a prefix of A that starts at the first element and ends at the last element.
