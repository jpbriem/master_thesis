LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The function applies a specific transformation to the input array, which can be described by the following rules:

1. If there is a sequence of consecutive equal elements in the input array, the function replaces it with a single element having the same value. For example, the sequence [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6] becomes [0, 6].
2. If there is a sequence of consecutive unequal elements in the input array, the function leaves it unchanged. For example, the sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 0] remains the same.
3. If there is a sequence of consecutive equal elements followed by a sequence of consecutive unequal elements, the function replaces the first sequence with a single element having the same value and leaves the second sequence unchanged. For example, the sequence [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3] becomes [0, 3].
4. If there is a sequence of consecutive unequal elements followed by a sequence of consecutive equal elements, the function leaves the first sequence unchanged and replaces the second sequence with a single element having the same value. For example, the sequence [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0] becomes [0, 3, 0].

Given these rules, we can apply them iteratively to transform the input array into the output array.

Solution:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
