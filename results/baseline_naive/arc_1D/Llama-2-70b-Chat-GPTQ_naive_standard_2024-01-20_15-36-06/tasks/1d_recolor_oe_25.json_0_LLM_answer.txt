LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Test case:
input: [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]

The given input sequence can be transformed into the output sequence by a sliding window of size 4 (i.e., considering 4 elements at a time). At each step, the maximum value in the current window is selected and added to the output sequence. If there are fewer than 4 elements remaining in the input sequence, they are simply appended to the end of the output sequence.
For example, for the first input sequence provided above, the corresponding output sequence would be obtained by applying the following operations:

1. Considering the first 4 elements of the input sequence: [0, 5, 5, 5], the maximum value is 5, which is added to the output sequence, resulting in [0, 5].
2. Moving the window forward by 1 element: [5, 5, 5, 5], the maximum value is still 5, which is already in the output sequence, so nothing changes.
3. Moving the window forward by 1 element again: [5, 5, 5, 0], the maximum value is now 5, which is already in the output sequence, so nothing changes.
4. Moving the window forward by 1 element again: [5, 0, 5, 5], the maximum value is 5, which is added to the output sequence, resulting in [0, 5, 5].
5. And so on...
Note that when the window reaches the end of the input sequence, it will simply add any remaining elements to the output sequence (as seen in the last few steps of the example).

Solution:
[0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0]
