LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive equal elements in the input array and replace all occurrences of that element with its doubled value. If there are multiple such sequences, the one with the largest length should be preferred.
In the first example, the input array contains three sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0], [9], and [0]. The longest sequence has length 4, which is the number of times 9 appears consecutively. Therefore, the output array should have a sequence of four 9s, followed by a single 0.
In the second example, the input array contains two sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0] and [7]. The longest sequence has length 3, which is the number of times 7 appears consecutively. Therefore, the output array should have a sequence of three 7s, followed by a single 0.
In the third example, the input array contains three sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0], [1], and [8]. The longest sequence has length 4, which is the number of times 1 appears consecutively. Therefore, the output array should have a sequence of four 2s (since 2 is twice 1), followed by a single 0.
Note that the order of elements in the output array matters. The doubles of the consecutive equal elements should be grouped together and appear in the output array in the same order as they appeared in the input array.
