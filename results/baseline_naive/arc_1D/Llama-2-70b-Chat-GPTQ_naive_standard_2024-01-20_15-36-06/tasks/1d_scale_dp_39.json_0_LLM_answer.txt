LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0]

The transformation is done by replacing all occurrences of a digit with the maximum value among all digits in the input array that are less than or equal to the current position of the digit being replaced. If there are no digits less than or equal to the current position, then the digit remains unchanged.
For example, in the first input array, the digit 6 at index 1 is replaced by 6 because it's the maximum value among all digits less than or equal to index 1 (which is 6). Similarly, the digit 6 at index 7 is also replaced by 6 for the same reason. However, the digit 0 at index 9 remains unchanged because there are no digits less than or equal to index 9.
In the second input array, the digit 2 at index 1 is replaced by 2 because it's the maximum value among all digits less than or equal to index 1 (which is 2). Similarly, the digit 0 at index 4 is replaced by 2 because there are no digits less than or equal to index 4.
In the third input array, the digit 6 at index 5 is replaced by 6 because it's the maximum value among all digits less than or equal to index 5 (which is 6).
In the test case, the digit 2 at index 3 is replaced by 2 because it's the maximum value among all digits less than or equal to index 3 (which is 2).
Note that the input array can have duplicate digits and/or leading zeros. Also, the output array may have duplicates as well.
