LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a simple one. For each group of three or more consecutive identical elements in the input array, replace the first two elements with the third element. If there are fewer than three identical elements, do nothing.

For example, in Example_1, the input array has several groups of three or more consecutive identical elements: [0, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 8], and [0, 0, 0]. Applying the transformation to these groups produces the output array: [0, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8], and [0, 0, 0].

In Example_2, the input array has several groups of three or more consecutive identical elements: [0, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 2], and [0, 0, 6]. Applying the transformation to these groups produces the output array: [0, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7], [2, 2, 2], and [6, 6, 6].

In Example_3, the input array has several groups of three or more consecutive identical elements: [0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 7], and [0, 0, 1]. Applying the transformation to these groups produces the output array: [0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7], and [1, 1, 1].

Note that the order of the input array does not change; only the values within each group of identical elements are modified. Also, note that leading zeros are preserved in the output array.

Solution:
[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
