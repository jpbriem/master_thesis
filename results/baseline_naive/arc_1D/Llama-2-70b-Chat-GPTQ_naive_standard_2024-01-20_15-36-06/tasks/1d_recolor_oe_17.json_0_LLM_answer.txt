LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Explanation:
The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the given binary array. The given array has 4's instead of 1's. To solve this problem, we need to first convert all 4's to 1's and then find the maximum number of consecutive 1's. Finally, we need to convert all 1's back to 4's to get the final output.

In the example inputs, you can see that there are always two sets of consecutive 4's. One set contains the starting indices of the runs of consecutive 4's (which will become 1's) and the other set contains the ending indices of those runs (which will remain 0). The difference between the starting and ending indices of each run will give us the length of each run. We need to find the maximum length of any run which will give us the maximum number of consecutive 1's.

Solution:
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]
