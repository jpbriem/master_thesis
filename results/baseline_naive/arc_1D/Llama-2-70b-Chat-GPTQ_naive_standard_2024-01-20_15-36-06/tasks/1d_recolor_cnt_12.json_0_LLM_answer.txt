LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation pattern is as follows:
* Each group of three or more consecutive identical elements in the input array is replaced by a single element with value equal to the sum of the elements in the group.
* If there are fewer than three consecutive identical elements at the beginning or end of the array, they are left unchanged.
* All other elements in the array are set to zero.

For example, in Example_1, the first group of three consecutive identical elements (0, 0, 0) is replaced by a single element with value 0, since the sum of the elements in the group is also 0. The second group of three consecutive identical elements (6, 6, 6) is replaced by a single element with value 18, since the sum of the elements in the group is 18. And so on.

In Example_2, the first group of three consecutive identical elements (0, 0, 0) is replaced by a single element with value 0, since the sum of the elements in the group is also 0. The second group of three consecutive identical elements (6, 6, 6) is replaced by a single element with value 18, since the sum of the elements in the group is 18. And so on.

In Example_3, the first group of three consecutive identical elements (0, 0, 6) is replaced by a single element with value 6, since the sum of the elements in the group is 6. The second group of three consecutive identical elements (6, 6, 6) is replaced by a single element with value 18, since the sum of the elements in the group is 18. And so on.

Note that the order of the output array may be different from the order of the input array. Also, some groups of elements in the input array may not be replaced if they do not meet the condition of having three or more consecutive identical elements.
