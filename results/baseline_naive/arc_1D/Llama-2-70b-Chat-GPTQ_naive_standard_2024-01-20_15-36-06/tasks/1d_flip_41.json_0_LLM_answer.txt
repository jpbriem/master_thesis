LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In all three examples, the output is a modified version of the input where all occurrences of the number 3 (or 5 in the third example) have been replaced by the number that comes after them in the input array. For instance, in the first example, the 3s in positions 4, 7, and 9 have been replaced with 1, 3, and 3 respectively because those numbers come after the 3s in the input array.
The test case verifies that the function can handle a variety of inputs, including instances where the number being replaced occurs at the beginning or end of the array, as well as cases where it appears multiple times.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
