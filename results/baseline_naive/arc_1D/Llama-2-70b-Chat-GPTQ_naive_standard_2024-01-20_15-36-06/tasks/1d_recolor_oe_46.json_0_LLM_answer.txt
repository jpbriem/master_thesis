LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]

Notice that in each example, there is a sequence of consecutive equal elements (either 0 or 7) followed by a single element that is not equal to the previous elements. This pattern is repeated multiple times, with the only difference being the location of the sequence of equal elements and the value of the non-equal element.
The goal is to transform the input array into an output array where all elements are either 0 or 3, by replacing every subsequence of consecutive equal elements with a single element that is not equal to the previous elements.
In other words, compress consecutive equal elements into a single element while preserving the order of the original sequence.

Solution:
[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
