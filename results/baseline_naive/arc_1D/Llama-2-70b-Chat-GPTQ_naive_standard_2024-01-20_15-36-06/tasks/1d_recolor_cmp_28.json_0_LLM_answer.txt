LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first, but once you see it, it's quite simple. The output values are simply shifted versions of the input values. To generate the output for a given position, you take the input value at that position, and then "shift" it by some number of positions to the right. The number of positions to shift is determined by the number of zeroes that appear between the input value and its corresponding output value.
For example, in the first input-output pair, the input value at position 0 is 4, and the output value at position 0 is also 4. The number of zeroes between the two values is 4 - 0 = 4. Therefore, the output value at position 1 is 4 shifted 4 positions to the right, which gives us 7. Similarly, the output value at position 2 is 4 shifted 8 positions to the right, which gives us 7 again.
In general, if there are k zeroes between an input value x and its corresponding output value y, then the output value at position k is equal to x shifted k positions to the right. If there are no zeroes between the input value and its corresponding output value (i.e., k = 0), then the output value at position 0 is equal to the input value.
Note that this transformation preserves the order of the input values. That is, if the input values are sorted in ascending order, then so are the output values.
