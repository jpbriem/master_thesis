LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]
output: [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]

Notice that in all of these examples, there is a single "7" at the end of the input array, which is not included in the output array. This is because the last element of the input array is always equal to the last element of the output array, so it does not need to be explicitly listed.

In general, the transformation pattern involves shifting the elements of the input array by some number of positions (in this case, three), and then filling in any gaps with zeros. The output array has the same length as the input array, but with a different set of values.

Solution:
[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
