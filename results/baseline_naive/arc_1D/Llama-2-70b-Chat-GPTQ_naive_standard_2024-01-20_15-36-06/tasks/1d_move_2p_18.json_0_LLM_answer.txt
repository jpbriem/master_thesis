LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this problem, we need to find a way to transform the input array in such a way that all occurrences of a specific value (in these cases, 7, 6, or 5) are replaced with another value (in these cases, 0). However, there is a twist - the value that needs to be replaced should only be changed if it appears consecutively at least three times in the array. If the value does not appear consecutively at least three times, it should not be changed.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can create a window of size 3 and keep track of the values that appear in the window. If a value appears consecutively at least three times in the window, we know that it meets the condition of appearing consecutively at least three times in the entire array. Therefore, we can replace that value with the new value.

Here's an example of how the sliding window would work for the first input array:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The window starts at the beginning of the array, and we check if the value in the window (in this case, 0) appears consecutively at least three times. Since it does, we replace the value in the output array with 0.

The window then moves to the next three elements, which are also 0. Again, we check if the value in the window appears consecutively at least three times, and since it does, we replace the value in the output array with 0.

The process continues until we reach the end of the array. When we encounter the first 7 in the array, we check if it appears consecutively at least three times in the window. Since it does, we replace it with 0. We continue this process until we reach the end of the array, replacing all occurrences of 7 with 0.

The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

For the second input array, the process would work similarly, but with a different value being replaced. The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

For the third input array, the process would work similarly again, but with yet another different value being replaced. The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0].

Finally, for the test case, the process would work similarly, but with a different value being replaced. The resulting output array would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0].
