LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a simple one. For each group of equal elements in the input array, replace each element with the maximum value among all elements in that group. In other words, for each run of equal elements, replace each element with the last element in that run.

For example, in Example_1, the first three elements are equal (0), so they are replaced by the maximum value among them (which is still 0). Then, the next three elements are also equal (3), so they are replaced by the maximum value among them (which is 3). And so on.

In Example_2, the first six elements are equal (0), so they are replaced by the maximum value among them (which is still 0). Then, the next five elements are equal (6), so they are replaced by the maximum value among them (which is 6). And so on.

In Example_3, the first two elements are equal (0), so they are replaced by the maximum value among them (which is still 0). Then, the next four elements are equal (2), so they are replaced by the maximum value among them (which is 2). And so on.

Note that the order of the output array may be different from the order of the input array. Also, note that this problem statement does not explicitly specify what should happen to the input array if there are multiple groups of equal elements with different maxima. It is up to you to decide how to handle such cases.
