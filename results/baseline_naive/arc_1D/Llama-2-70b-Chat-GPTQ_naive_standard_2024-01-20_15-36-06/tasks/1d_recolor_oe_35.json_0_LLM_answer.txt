LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The task is to find a pattern in the given input array and output the corresponding transformed array. The pattern is based on the number of consecutive equal elements in the input array. If there are 'n' consecutive equal elements, then the corresponding output element is 'n'. Otherwise, it's zero.
For example, in the first input array, there are four consecutive zeros at the beginning, so the output for that part of the array is 4. Then, there are four consecutive non-zero elements (all equal to 4), so the output for that part of the array is also 4. Finally, there are four more consecutive zeros at the end, so the last four output elements are all 0.
In the second input array, there are three parts: two sequences of consecutive equal elements (4 and 8) and a single zero in between. Therefore, the output has three parts as well: 1 for the first sequence of equal elements, 8 for the second one, and 0 for the single zero in between.
In the third input array, there are again four consecutive equal elements at the beginning (4), followed by a single zero, another sequence of four consecutive equal elements (4), another single zero, and finally four more consecutive equal elements (4). So, the output would be 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, respectively.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
