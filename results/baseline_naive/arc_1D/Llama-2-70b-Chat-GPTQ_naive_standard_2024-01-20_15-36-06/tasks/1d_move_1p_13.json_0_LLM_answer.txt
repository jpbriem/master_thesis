LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The first line of each pair is the input array, and the second line is the expected output array. Note that in all three examples, the input array has a length of 16, while the output array has a length of 15. This is because the last element of the input array is always zero, and it is ignored when creating the output array.
In Example 1, the input array contains seven consecutive 7's, starting from the third element. The output array has seven consecutive 7's as well, but they start from the second element.
In Example 2, the input array contains five consecutive 4's, starting from the fourth element. The output array has four consecutive 4's, starting from the third element.
In Example 3, the input array contains thirteen consecutive 4's. The output array has four consecutive 4's, starting from the second element.
In the test case, the input array contains ten consecutive 4's, starting from the third element. The output array has four consecutive 4's, starting from the second element.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
