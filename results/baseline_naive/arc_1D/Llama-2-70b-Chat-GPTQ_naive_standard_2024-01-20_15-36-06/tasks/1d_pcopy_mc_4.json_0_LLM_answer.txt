LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a simple one. For each group of identical elements in the input array, replace the first occurrence with the number of occurrences (count) followed by all instances of that element repeated count times. If there are no more occurrences of that element after the first one, do not include it in the output.

For example, in Example_1, the first group has 5 '0's, so the output starts with '0 5'. The second group has 3 '9's, so the output continues with '9 3'. The third group has only one '1', so it is skipped. The fourth group has 2 '0's, so the output continues with '0 2'. And so on.

In Example_3, the first group has 4 '5's, so the output starts with '5 4'. The second group has only one '2', so it is skipped. The third group has 3 '0's, so the output continues with '0 3'. And so on.

Note that leading zeros in the input are significant. A group of all zeroes will produce a single '0' in the output, as seen in Example_1.

Solution:
[0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
