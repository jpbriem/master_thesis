LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first, but once you see it, it's quite simple. The basic idea is that each digit in the input array is either zero or nonzero. If it's zero, we leave it alone. If it's nonzero, we set all subsequent digits to zero until we reach another nonzero digit (which may be at the end of the array). Then we set that nonzero digit to zero.

So for example, in the first test case, the input array has three nonzero digits: 8, 8, and 8. We set all subsequent digits to zero until we reach the next nonzero digit, which is also 8. So the output array has three zeros followed by an 8.

In the second test case, the input array has four nonzero digits: 7, 7, 7, and 7. We set all subsequent digits to zero until we reach the next nonzero digit, which is also 7. So the output array has four zeros followed by a 7.

In the third test case, the input array has five nonzero digits: 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. We set all subsequent digits to zero until we reach the next nonzero digit, which is also 1. So the output array has five zeros followed by a 1.

Note that there may be leading zeros in the output array if the input array has leading zeros. Also note that this problem statement doesn't explicitly specify what should happen if the input array has trailing zeros, but based on the examples, it seems that trailing zeros should be ignored (i.e., not copied to the output array).

Solution:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
