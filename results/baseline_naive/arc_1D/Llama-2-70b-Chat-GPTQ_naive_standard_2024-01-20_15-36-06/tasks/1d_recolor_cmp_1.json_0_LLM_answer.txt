LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Notice that in each example, there is a sequence of four consecutive equal elements (either all 0 or all 4) followed by another sequence of four consecutive equal elements. The task is to replace the first occurrence of such a sequence with its complementary value while maintaining the order of the remaining elements. For instance, in Example_1, the first sequence of four consecutive 0s is replaced with four consecutive 4s, resulting in [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]. Similarly, in Example_3, the first sequence of four consecutive 4s is replaced with four consecutive 0s, resulting in [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0].

The goal is to write an efficient algorithm that can handle large inputs and produce the desired output for any valid input.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
