LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 9, 0, 3, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first, but once you see it, it's quite simple. Each group of three consecutive elements in the input array (e.g., [0, 0, 0]) is transformed into a single element in the output array (e.g., [8]). Specifically:
* If the three elements in the input are all zeroes, the corresponding output element is 8.
* If two of the three elements in the input are zeroes and the third is a six, the corresponding output element is 9.
* If one of the three elements in the input is a six and the other two are zeroes, the corresponding output element is 3.
* If all three elements in the input are sixes, the corresponding output element is also 6.

All other elements in the input that do not fit these patterns remain unchanged in the output.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
