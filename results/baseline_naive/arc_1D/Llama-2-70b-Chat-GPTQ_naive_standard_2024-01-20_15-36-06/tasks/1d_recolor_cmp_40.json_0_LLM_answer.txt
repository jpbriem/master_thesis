LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive equal elements in the input array and replace them with a single element having the same value. If there are multiple such sequences, the longest sequence should be replaced first.
In all the above examples, the input arrays have been transformed by replacing the maximum consecutive equal elements with a single element having the same value. In example_1, the subarray [9, 9, 9, 9, 9] has been replaced with [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. Similarly, in example_2, the subarray [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] has been replaced with [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. In example_3, the subarrays [9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9], and [9, 9, 9, 9, 9] have been replaced with [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], and [4, 4, 4, 4, 4] respectively.
Note that the order of the input array has not been changed, only the values of the elements have been modified. Also, the output array may have fewer elements than the input array if some elements have been replaced with a single element.

Solution:
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0]
