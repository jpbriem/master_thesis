LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The first line of each pair is the input array, and the second line is the expected output array. Note that in all three examples, the input arrays have a length of 12, while the output arrays have a length of 11. This is because the last element of the input array is always zero, and it is ignored when creating the output array.
In Example 1, the input array contains nine consecutive sixes, followed by three zeros. The output array has eight consecutive sixes, followed by two zeros and then another six. In Example 2, the input array contains four consecutive twos, followed by seven zeros. The output array has three consecutive twos, followed by four zeros and then another two. In Example 3, the input array contains six consecutive sixes, followed by five zeros. The output array has five consecutive sixes, followed by three zeros and then another six.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
