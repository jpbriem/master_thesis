LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0]
output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]

The first line of each test case contains a list of integers that represents the input vector. Each integer in the input vector is either 0 or a positive integer. The second line of each test case contains a list of integers that represents the output vector. The task is to determine the transformation that was applied to the input vector to produce the output vector.
In this problem, we are given a sequence of integers as input and our task is to find the longest sequence of equal elements in it. We can do this by traversing the array and keeping track of the current maximum length sequence and its starting index. Whenever we encounter an element that is not equal to the previous element, we update the maximum length sequence and its starting index. At the end, we return the maximum length sequence and its starting index.
For example, if the input is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], the longest sequence of equal elements is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], which has a length of 9.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0]
