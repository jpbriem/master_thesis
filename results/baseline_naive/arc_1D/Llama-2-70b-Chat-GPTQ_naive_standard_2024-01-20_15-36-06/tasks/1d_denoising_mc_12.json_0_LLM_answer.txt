LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation:
The function should take an array of integers as input and return an array of integers as output. The input array contains a sequence of positive integers (> 0) separated by zeroes. The task is to remove all zeroes from the input array and maintain the relative order of the positive integers.
For example, in the first input-output pair, the input array has three sequences of positive integers: [6, 6, 6], [2, 6, 6, 6], and [9, 6, 6]. The output array should have the same three sequences with all zeroes removed: [6, 6, 6], [2, 6, 6, 6], and [9, 6, 6].
In the second input-output pair, the input array has two sequences of positive integers: [6, 6, 6, 6] and [6, 4, 6, 6, 6]. The output array should have the same two sequences with all zeroes removed: [6, 6, 6, 6] and [6, 4, 6, 6, 6].
In the third input-output pair, the input array has four sequences of positive integers: [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], and [1, 3, 3, 3, 3]. The output array should have the same four sequences with all zeroes removed: [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3], and [1, 3, 3, 3, 3].
Note that the input array may contain multiple sequences of positive integers separated by zeroes, and the relative order of the positive integers within each sequence should be preserved in the output array. The number of sequences and the length of each sequence can vary in different input arrays.
