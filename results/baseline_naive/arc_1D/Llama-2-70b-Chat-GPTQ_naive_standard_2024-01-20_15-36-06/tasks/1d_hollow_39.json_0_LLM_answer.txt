LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first but if you look closely it's just shifting values around.
In all of the examples provided, the output has the same number of elements as the input. In particular, the length of the output array is equal to the length of the input array.

In Example 1, the last 8 elements of the input array are set to zero, and then the remaining elements are shifted to the left by 8 positions. This can be done in place without allocating extra memory.

In Example 2, the middle 4 elements of the input array are set to zero, and then the remaining elements are shifted to the left by 4 positions. Again, this can be done in place without allocating extra memory.

In Example 3, the rightmost 5 elements of the input array are set to zero, and then the remaining elements are shifted to the right by 5 positions. Once again, this can be done in place without allocating extra memory.

In the test case, the middle 2 elements of the input array are set to zero, and then the remaining elements are shifted to the left by 2 positions.

Notice that in each example, the number of elements set to zero is always less than or equal to half the length of the input array. Moreover, the number of elements shifted is always less than or equal to half the length of the input array minus the number of elements set to zero.

This means that we don't need to allocate any extra memory when performing the transformation because we only need to shift elements around within the existing array.

Solution:
[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
