LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The function applies a specific transformation to the input array, which can be described by the following rules:

1. If there is a sequence of consecutive equal elements in the input array (including single elements), the function replaces it with the first element of the sequence repeated as many times as the length of the sequence.
2. If there are multiple sequences of consecutive equal elements in the input array, the function applies rule 1 separately to each sequence.
3. If there are no consecutive equal elements in the input array, the function returns the input array unchanged.

In Example_1, the input array contains three sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0], [3], and [9]. The function applies rule 1 to each sequence, resulting in the output array [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0].

In Example_2, the input array contains two sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0] and [9]. The function applies rule 1 to both sequences, resulting in the output array [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

In Example_3, the input array contains three sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0], [5], and [8]. The function applies rule 1 to each sequence, resulting in the output array [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0].

In the test case, the input array contains four sequences of consecutive equal elements: [0], [3], [6], and [7]. The function applies rule 1 to each sequence, resulting in the output array [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7].
