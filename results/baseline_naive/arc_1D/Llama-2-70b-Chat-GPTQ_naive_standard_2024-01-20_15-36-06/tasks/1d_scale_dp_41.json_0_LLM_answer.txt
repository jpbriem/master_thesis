LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 0]

Test case:
input: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]

The transformation is a simple one. For each group of consecutive equal elements in the input array, the corresponding output element is set to the last element of that group. All other elements in the output array are set to 0.

For example, in Example_1, there are three groups of consecutive equal elements in the input array: [0], [2], and [2]. In the output array, these groups become [0], [2], and [2].

In Example_2, there are four groups of consecutive equal elements in the input array: [0], [2], [2], and [0]. In the output array, these groups become [0], [2], [2], and [0].

In Example_3, there are two groups of consecutive equal elements in the input array: [0] and [7]. In the output array, these groups become [0] and [7].

Note that the order of the groups in the output array does not matter, as long as all elements in each group are set correctly. Also, note that the input array may contain arbitrary many groups of consecutive equal elements, and the output array will have the same number of elements as the input array.

Solution:
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0]
