LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation:
The given function takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of integers as output. The task is to find the maximum number of consecutive equal elements in the input array and return it.
In all the above examples, we can see that the output is the maximum number of consecutive equal elements in the input array.
In Example_1, the maximum number of consecutive equal elements is 6, which appears three times in the input array. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
Similarly, in Example_2, the maximum number of consecutive equal elements is 9, which appears four times in the input array. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
In Example_3, the maximum number of consecutive equal elements is 5, which appears three times in the input array. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
In the test case, the maximum number of consecutive equal elements is 4, which appears twice in the input array. Therefore, the output is [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
Note that the input array may contain negative numbers, but the output will only contain positive numbers. Also, the input array may have a length of up to 10^5, and the maximum value in the array will be at most 10^5.
