LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9]
output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]

Example_2:
input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 0, 0]

Example_3:
input: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 9]

Notice that in each example, all occurrences of a digit (either 0 or non-zero) are replaced by the next occurrence of that digit in the input array. For instance, in Example_1, all instances of 1 are replaced with 0, while all instances of 0 are replaced with 1. In Example_2, all instances of 7 are replaced with 0, while all instances of 0 are replaced with 7. In Example_3, all instances of 2 are replaced with 0, while all instances of 0 are replaced with 2. Finally, in the test case, all instances of 7 are replaced with 0, while all instances of 0 are replaced with 7.

Write a function to perform this transformation on an input array.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 9]
