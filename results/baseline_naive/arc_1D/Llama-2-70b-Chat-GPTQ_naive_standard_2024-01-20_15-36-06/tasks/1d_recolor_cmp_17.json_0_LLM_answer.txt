LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 7, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
Explanation:
The given input sequence consists of a series of 0s and 7s. The task is to replace all occurrences of seven consecutive 0s with five 5s. All other elements should remain unchanged.
In the first example, there are three groups of seven consecutive 0s; each group is replaced by five 5s. In the second example, there are four groups of seven consecutive 0s; each group is replaced by five 5s. In the third example, there are two groups of seven consecutive 0s; each group is replaced by five 5s. In the test case, there are eight groups of seven consecutive 0s; each group is replaced by five 5s.
