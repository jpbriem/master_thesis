LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]

Explanation:
The task is to find the longest sequence of equal elements in the input array. In each example, the output shows the transformed input with the longest sequence of equal elements shifted to the beginning of the array.
In Example_1, there are three sequences of equal elements: [3], [3], and [3]. The longest sequence is [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], which has a length of 9. Therefore, the transformed output starts with this sequence shifted to the beginning: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0].
In Example_2, there are two sequences of equal elements: [0] and [5]. The longest sequence is [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], which has a length of 5. Therefore, the transformed output starts with this sequence shifted to the beginning: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 0].
In Example_3, there are two sequences of equal elements: [0] and [1]. The longest sequence is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which has a length of 5. Therefore, the transformed output starts with this sequence shifted to the beginning: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
In the test case, there are two sequences of equal elements: [0] and [7]. The longest sequence is [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], which has a length of 8. Therefore, the transformed output starts with this sequence shifted to the beginning: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6].

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6]
