LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0]

Example_2:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8]

Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]
output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 0, 0]

Test case:
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

LLM answer:

output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The first line of each pair is the input array, and the second line is the expected output array. Note that all input arrays have a length of 20 in these examples. Also, note that the last two elements of each input array are always zeroes, which is not coincidental but rather a consequence of how the transformation works (as explained below).

The transformation itself is quite simple. It takes an array of 20 elements as input and produces another array of 20 elements as output. The catch here is that the transformation only modifies every other element of the input array starting from the second element (index 1), leaving the first element untouched. In other words, if we denote the input array as A, then the output array B would be computed as follows:
B[0] = A[0]
B[1] = 2 * A[1]
B[2] = 2 * A[2]
B[3] = 2 * A[3]
...
B[19] = 2 * A[19]
B[20] = 0

In other words, every even index (starting from 0) remains the same in the output, while every odd index (starting from 1) gets doubled in the output. This can easily be verified by looking at the provided example inputs and outputs.

Your task is to write a function that implements this transformation for any given input array.

Solution:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
