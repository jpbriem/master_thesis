LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a']
output: ['a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Explanation of the solution:
The given input is a list of characters, where each character appears twice or thrice. We need to transform this list into another list such that no character appears more than once.

To achieve this, we can use a simple technique based on the observation that if a character appears three times in the input list, it must appear only once in the output list. Similarly, if a character appears twice in the input list, it must not appear at all in the output list.

We can implement this technique by maintaining two pointers, one pointing to the beginning of the input list and the other pointing to the end of the input list. As we move both pointers simultaneously through the input list, we keep track of the characters we have already seen and avoid repeating them in the output list. If a character has appeared three times in the input list, we include it in the output list only once. If a character has appeared twice in the input list, we do not include it in the output list at all.

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `p` and `q`, both pointing to the beginning of the input list.
2. Set `p` to the first character in the input list and `q` to the second character in the input list.
3. While `p` and `q` are still within the bounds of the input list, do the following:
	* Check if the character at `p` has appeared three times in the input list. If so, include it in the output list only once (i.e., advance `p` to the next character).
	* If the character at `p` has appeared only twice in the input list, skip it (i.e., do not include it in the output list) and advance `p` to the next character.
	* If the character at `p` has not appeared at all in the input list, include it in the output list (i.e., advance `p` to the next character).
4. When `p` reaches the end of the input list, set `q` to the beginning of the input list and repeat steps 3 and 4 until both `p` and `q` reach the end of the input list.
5. Finally, concatenate the output lists obtained from steps 3 and 4 to obtain the final output list.

This solution ensures that no character appears more than once in the output list, while preserving the order of appearance of the characters in the input list.
