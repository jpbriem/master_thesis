LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['e', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'e', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'f', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'd', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'd', '.', '.', '.', '.']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', '.', '.', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', '.', '.', '.']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current character in the input sequence is not a dot (.), then it should be added to the output sequence. Otherwise, if the current character is a dot (.), then we need to check whether there exists another dot in the input sequence immediately after this one. If so, we remove all dots between them and add the remaining dots to the output sequence. Otherwise, we simply add the current dot to the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first two characters are e and f respectively, which are not dots, so they are added to the output sequence. Then, the next three characters are also f's, which are not dots, so they are added to the output sequence. After that, there are four consecutive f's, which are removed from the input sequence because they are not dots. Finally, there are eight more f's, which are added to the output sequence.

Similarly, in Example_2, the first character is a dot, so we need to check whether there exists another dot immediately after it. There is no such dot, so we simply add the current dot to the output sequence. Then, the next six characters are h's, which are not dots, so they are added to the output sequence. After that, there are seven more h's, which are removed from the input sequence because they are not dots. Finally, there are two more h's, which are added to the output sequence.

In Example_3, the first character is also a dot, so we need to check whether there exists another dot immediately after it. There is no such dot, so we simply add the current dot to the output sequence. Then, the next five characters are d's, which are not dots, so they are added to the output sequence. After that, there are six more h's, which are removed from the input sequence because they are not dots. Finally, there are two more h's, which are added to the output sequence.

Finally, in Test case, the first character is a dot, so we need to check whether there exists another dot immediately after it. There is no such dot, so we simply add the current dot to the output sequence. Then, the next nine characters are e's, which are not dots, so they are added to the output sequence. After that, there are ten more e's, which are removed from the input sequence because they are not dots. Finally, there are two more e's, which are added to the output sequence.
