LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', '.', '.', 'a', 'a', 'a', '.', '.', 'c', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', '.', '.', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', '.', '.', 'c', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'c', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'c']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'c']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'c', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'c', '.']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current character in the input sequence is not equal to the previous character, then it should be added to the output sequence. Otherwise, it should be skipped.
2. After processing all characters in the input sequence, the resulting output sequence should have the same length as the input sequence.

For example, for Example_1, the first character ('.') is not equal to the previous character ('.'), so it is added to the output sequence. Similarly, the second character ('.') is also not equal to the previous character ('.'), so it is added to the output sequence. However, the third character ('.') is equal to the previous character ('.'), so it is skipped. This process continues until all characters in the input sequence have been processed.

Similarly, for Example_2, the first character ('.') is not equal to the previous character ('.'), so it is added to the output sequence. However, the second character (e) is equal to the previous character (e), so it is skipped. This process continues until all characters in the input sequence have been processed.

Finally, for Example_3, the first character ('.') is not equal to the previous character ('.'), so it is added to the output sequence. However, all subsequent characters (d) are equal to the previous character (d), so they are skipped. This process continues until all characters in the input sequence have been processed.

In summary, the task is to apply a simple transformation rule to each character in an input sequence to obtain a corresponding output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
