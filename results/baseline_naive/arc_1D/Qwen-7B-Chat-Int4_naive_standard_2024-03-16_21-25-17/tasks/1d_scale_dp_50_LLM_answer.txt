Example_3:
input: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]
output: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0]

Test case:

Sample Outputs:
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = {}
        
        for num in nums:
            if num not in count:
                count[num] = 1
            else:
                count[num] += 1
        
        max_count = max(count.values())
        for num in count:
            if count[num] == max_count:
                return num
```

In this solution, we use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element in the input list. We iterate through the list and update the frequency of each element in the dictionary. Then we find the maximum frequency among all elements in the dictionary and return that as the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we only need to iterate through the list once. The space complexity is also O(n) because we need to store the frequency of each element in the dictionary.
