The code above uses recursion to generate all possible permutations of the input array. It first checks if the length of the array is 0, and if so, returns an empty list as there are no more permutations to be generated.
For non-empty arrays, it loops through each element of the array and generates permutations recursively by skipping the current element (since it has been visited before), generating permutations from the remaining elements, and adding the current element to the end of the permutation path.
It then appends the current permutation path to the result list and continues with the next element. Finally, it returns the result list containing all permutations of the input array.
