Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain two pointers, i and j, which represent the start and end of our current window respectively. At each step, we will update the window by shifting all elements to the right until we encounter an element that is different from the previous one.
We will also keep track of the maximum number seen so far in the window. If we encounter a new maximum number, we will replace all occurrences of the old maximum number with the new maximum number.
Here's the Python code for this solution:

```python
def maxNumberInWindow(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return []
    
    i = 0
    j = 0
    result = []
    max_num = nums[0]
    
    while j < len(nums):
        # Update the maximum number seen so far
        max_num = max(max_num, nums[j])
        
        # Add the current element to the result
        result.append(nums[i])
        
        # Shift the window to the right
        while j + 1 < len(nums) and nums[j] == nums[j+1]:
            j += 1
        
        # Replace any occurrence of the old maximum number with the new maximum number
        while i < j and nums[i] != max_num:
            result[i] = max_num
            i += 1
        
        i = j + 1
    
    return result
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It works by iterating over the array once, and performing constant-time operations at each step. The space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the result.
