Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def split_to_two_parts(arr):
    # Find the first occurrence of 0 in arr
    i = 0
    while i < len(arr) and arr[i] == 0:
        i += 1
    
    # Split arr into two parts at index i
    part1 = arr[:i]
    part2 = arr[i:]
    
    return [part1, part2]
```

This function takes an array `arr` as input and returns two new arrays, one containing all even elements of `arr`, and the other containing all odd elements. 

The function works by finding the first occurrence of 0 in `arr`. Since we want to split `arr` into two parts based on whether each element is even or odd, we need to find the index of the first zero so that we can split `arr` into two parts based on this index.

Once we have found the index of the first zero, we use slicing to create two new arrays: `part1` contains all elements up to (and including) the first zero, and `part2` contains all elements starting from the second zero (if there is one).

For example, if we call `split_to_two_parts([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0])`, the function will return `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and `[2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input array has at least one zero. If the input array does not contain any zeros, then the function will simply return the original array unchanged.
