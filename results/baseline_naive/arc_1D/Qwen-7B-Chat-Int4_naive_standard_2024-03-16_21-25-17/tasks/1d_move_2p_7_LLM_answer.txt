```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        count = collections.Counter(nums)
        
        # find the most frequent element and its frequency
        max_freq = max(count.values())
        mode_num = count.most_common()[0][0]
        
        result = []
        for num in nums:
            if num == mode_num:
                count[num] -= 1
            else:
                count[num] += 1
            
            if count[num] == max_freq:
                result.append(num)
                
        return result
```

Explanation:

- We first create a Counter object to count the occurrences of each number in the input list.
- Then we find the most frequent element and its frequency using the `most_common()` method.
- Next, we iterate through the input list and update the counts in our counter accordingly. If the current number is equal to the mode number (i.e., the most frequent number), we subtract one from its count. Otherwise, we add one to it.
- Finally, we check if the current count equals the maximum frequency. If so, we append the current number to our result list.

Note that this solution assumes that there is at least one majority element in the input list. If there are multiple majority elements with the same frequency, this solution will only return one of them. To handle this case, you can modify the code to keep track of all majority elements and their frequencies.
