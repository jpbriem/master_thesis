Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-dimensional array to represent the input. We initialize all elements in the first row and column as zero, and then fill the remaining cells with zeros or ones based on the value of their neighbors.

Here is an example implementation in Python:

```python
def max_one_submatrix(matrix):
    m = len(matrix)
    n = len(matrix[0])

    # Initialize a 2D array to store the maximum one submatrix
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    # Fill the first row and column with zeros
    for i in range(m):
        dp[i][0] = 0
        dp[0][i] = 0

    # Fill the rest of the matrix
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i-1][j-1] == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1

    return dp[-1][-1]
```

In this implementation, `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of ones that can be placed in the submatrix formed by rows `i` to `m`, and columns `j` to `n`. The function starts by initializing the first row and column with zeros, and then fills the rest of the matrix using dynamic programming.

For each cell `(i, j)`, the function checks whether the cell at position `(i-1, j-1)` has a value of 1. If it does, then the current cell cannot have a value of 1, so the maximum number of ones in the submatrix is either the maximum number of ones in the previous row or the previous column. Otherwise, the current cell can have a value of 1, so the maximum number of ones in the submatrix is the sum of the maximum number of ones in the previous row and the previous column plus 1.

Finally, the function returns the maximum number of ones in the entire matrix. Note that this solution assumes that the input matrix contains only 0s and 1s. If there are other values in the input matrix, they will need to be handled separately.
