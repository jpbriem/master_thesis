Explanation:

- First, we initialize `max_num` as the first element in the array. We will use this variable to keep track of the maximum element in the array.
- Next, we iterate through the array and update `max_num` if we encounter a larger element.
- After finding the maximum element, we create an empty dictionary called `freq_dict` to store the frequency of each number in the array.
- We then iterate through the array again and update `freq_dict` with the frequency of each number. If a number is already in `freq_dict`, we increment its count by 1; otherwise, we add it to `freq_dict` with a count of 1.
- Finally, we iterate through the array once more and find the index of the maximum element that has a frequency greater than half the length of the array. We do this by checking if the current element is different from `max_num` and if its frequency in `freq_dict` is greater than or equal to `(len(nums) // 2)`. If we find such an element, we update `dominant_index` to be its index.
- Return `dominant_index` if it exists, or `-1` if no dominant element was found.
