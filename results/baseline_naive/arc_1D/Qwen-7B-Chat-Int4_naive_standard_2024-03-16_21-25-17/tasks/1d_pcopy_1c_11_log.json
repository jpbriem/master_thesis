We initialize the first row and column of `dp` with 1s, since any sequence containing only one element has length 1. Then we fill in the rest of `dp` by comparing each pair of elements from left to right.\n\nFor example, consider the input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The first row of `dp` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, since there are no two adjacent elements that differ in value. For the second row, we compare the last element of the previous row (`1`) with the first element of the current row (`0`). Since `1` is greater than `0`, we set `dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] + 1`, which gives us `2`. We continue this process until we have filled in all the rows of `dp`.\n\nFinally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence can be found by looking at the last element of `dp`, which contains the total number of increasing subsequences of length `n`."
