Here is an example solution in Python:

```python
def find_pattern(nums):
    if len(nums) < 7:
        return nums

    pattern = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i == 0 or i == 6:
            continue
        elif nums[i] != nums[i-1] and nums[i] != nums[i+1]:
            pattern.append(nums[i])
        else:
            while True:
                if len(pattern) > 3:
                    break
                if pattern[-1] != nums[i]:
                    pattern.pop()
                else:
                    break

    return pattern + nums[5:]
```

This function first checks the length of the input array to make sure it has at least seven elements. Then, it initializes a list `pattern` to store the pattern found so far.

The function then iterates through each element in the input array. If the current element is either the first or last element (i.e., index 0 or index 6), it is skipped. Otherwise, if the current element does not match its neighbors on both sides, it is added to the `pattern` list. If the current element matches its neighbors on both sides, the function enters a loop that continues until three consecutive elements are found in the `pattern` list, indicating that the pattern has been found.

Finally, the function appends the fifth element from the end of the input array (which corresponds to index 4) to the `pattern` list, since this element is guaranteed to be different from all the previous elements.

Note that this solution assumes that there exists a valid pattern with exactly four occurrences of the same value. If there can be more than one valid pattern with the given constraints, this solution may not work correctly.
