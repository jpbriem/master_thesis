Sample Outputs:
Here is one possible solution in Python:

```python
def compress(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return arr

    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each element
    counts = {}
    for num in arr:
        if num not in counts:
            counts[num] = 0
        counts[num] += 1

    # Initialize an array to store the compressed values
    compressed_arr = []
    index = 0
    while index < n:
        num = arr[index]
        count = counts.get(num, 0)

        # If there are multiple occurrences of this number, we need to find the maximum count
        if count > 0:
            max_count = count
            for i in range(index + 1, n):
                num_i = arr[i]
                if num_i != num and num_i in counts:
                    count_i = counts[num_i]
                    if count_i > max_count:
                        max_count = count_i
            compressed_arr.append(num * max_count)
        else:
            compressed_arr.append(num)

        # Move on to the next element
        index += max_count

    return compressed_arr
```

This function works by first creating a dictionary `counts` to store the count of each element in the input array. Then, it initializes an empty array `compressed_arr` to store the compressed values.

The function uses two pointers, `index` and `i`, to iterate over the input array. At each step, it checks whether the current element `arr[index]` has already been seen before (by checking its count in the dictionary). If so, it finds the maximum count among all occurrences of this element and adds this product to the compressed array.

If the current element has not been seen before, it simply adds it to the compressed array. After processing all elements, the function returns the compressed array.

Note that this solution assumes that the input array contains only non-negative integers. If the input can contain negative integers or other types of numbers, you may need to modify the solution accordingly.
