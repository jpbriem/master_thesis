Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We will have one pointer that starts at the beginning of the input array and another pointer that starts at the end of the input array. At each step, we will swap the elements pointed by these pointers if they are different.

Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

```python
def countZeroes(nums):
    left = right = 0
    while left < len(nums) and nums[left] == 0:
        left += 1

    while right < len(nums) and nums[right] == 0:
        right += 1

    count = right - left
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            count -= 1

    return count
```

We first initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the beginning and end of the input array respectively. We then loop until either `left` or `right` reaches the end of the array.

Inside the loop, we increment `left` or `right` depending on whether the element at that position is zero or not. After the loop, we calculate the total number of zeroes in the array by subtracting the number of zeroes from the right pointer minus the left pointer.

Finally, we iterate through the array starting from the `left` pointer and decrement the count whenever an element that is not equal to zero is encountered. The final result is the count of zeroes in the array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we only need to traverse the array once. The space complexity is also O(1), as we only use a constant amount of memory to store the pointers and the count variable.
