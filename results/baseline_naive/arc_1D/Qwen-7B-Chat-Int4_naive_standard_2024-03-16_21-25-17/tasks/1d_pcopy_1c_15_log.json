We will have two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and another at the end. The pointer at the beginning will always move forward while the pointer at the end will always move backward.\nAt each step, if both pointers point to elements that are equal to zero, we can safely remove them from the array as they cannot be used in any other calculation. If the element pointed by the first pointer is greater than or equal to the element pointed by the second pointer, we can swap these elements and move the second pointer one position back. This way, we ensure that the element with the highest value moves to the rightmost position.\nWe repeat this process until the pointers meet in the middle of the array. At this point, all the non-zero elements have been moved to their correct positions and there are no more zeros left in the array.\nHere's the Python code for this solution:\n\n```\ndef rearrange(arr):\n    i = 0\n    j = len(arr) - 1\n    \n    while i < j:\n        # Check if both pointers point to zeros\n        if arr[i] == 0 and arr[j] == 0:\n            del arr[i], arr[j]\n            continue\n        \n        # Swap elements if necessary\n        if arr[i] >= arr[j]:\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n            \n            # Move second pointer one position back\n            j -= 1\n            \n        else:\n            i += 1\n            \n    return arr\n```\n\nThis function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the rearranged array. It uses the two-pointer approach described above to rearrange the elements of the array in ascending order. Note that this implementation assumes that the input array contains only positive integers and does not handle negative integers or floating-point numbers."
