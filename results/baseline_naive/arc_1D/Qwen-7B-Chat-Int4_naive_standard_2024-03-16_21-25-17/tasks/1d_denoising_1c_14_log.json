We will maintain two pointers, `i` and `j`, which represent the current indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the array respectively. We will also maintain a variable `count`, which represents the number of consecutive occurrences of a value.\n\nWe start by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to 1. We then move `i` forward until we encounter a value that is different from the previous value at index `j`. When we do so, we update `count` to 1 if it's greater than 0 or set it to 0 otherwise.\n\nNext, we move `j` forward until we reach the end of the array. At each step, we check if the value at index `j` is equal to the value at index `i-1`. If they are not equal, we update `count` to 1 if it's greater than 0 or set it to 0 otherwise. Otherwise, we increment `i`.\n\nFinally, we return an array containing the values at indices `i-1` through `j-1`, with a count of `count` for each value.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef solution(arr):\n    i = j = 0\n    count = 0\n\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[i] != arr[j]:\n            if count > 0:\n                yield arr[i-count-1:i+1], count + 1\n            else:\n                yield arr[i:i+1], 1\n            count = 0\n        elif arr[i] == arr[j]:\n            count += 1\n        i += 1\n        j += 1\n\n    if count > 0:\n        yield arr[-count:], count + 1\n```\n\nThis code uses a generator function called `solution` to generate the output array. The function takes an input array `arr` as its argument.\n\nThe function initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to 1. It also initializes `count` to 0.\n\nThe function enters a loop that continues until `i` reaches the end of the array. Inside the loop, it checks if `arr[i]` is different from `arr[j]`. If it is, it updates `count` to 1 if it's greater than 0 or set it to 0 otherwise. It then increments both `i` and `j`.\n\nIf `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, it increments `count`.\n\nAfter updating `count`, the function yields an array containing the values at indices `i-1` through `j-1`, with a count of `count` for each value.\n\nOnce the loop completes, the function checks if `count` is greater than 0. If it is, it yields an array containing the last value in the array (`arr[-count:]`) along with `count + 1`.\n\nNote that the function returns an iterator object rather than a list. This allows us to handle large arrays more efficiently because we don't need to allocate all the memory for the entire output array at once. Instead, we can generate the output one element at a time as needed."
