If it is, the number is added directly to the result list. Otherwise, the solution checks whether the number is greater than 0 but less than 8. If it is, the solution subtracts 4 from the number repeatedly until it becomes a multiple of 4, and adds the resulting number to the result list. This ensures that all numbers that are not multiples of 4 are handled correctly."
