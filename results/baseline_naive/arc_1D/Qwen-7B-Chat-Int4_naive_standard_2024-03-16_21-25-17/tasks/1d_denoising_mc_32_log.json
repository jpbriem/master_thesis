We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the current window of elements that we are considering. At each step, we update the window by removing the element at index `right` and adding the next element in the array.\nWe also need to keep track of the maximum value in the window so far. Whenever we encounter an element with a higher value than the current maximum, we update the maximum value and move the right pointer accordingly.\nHere's the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray(nums):\n    left = 0\n    right = 0\n    max_val = nums[0]\n    curr_max = nums[0]\n    \n    while right < len(nums):\n        if nums[right] > max_val:\n            max_val = nums[right]\n            curr_max = nums[right]\n        else:\n            curr_max = max(curr_max, nums[right])\n            \n        right += 1\n        \n        if curr_max == max_val:\n            return nums[left:right]\n        \n    return None\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we initialize the left pointer to 0 and the right pointer to 0. We also initialize the maximum value (`max_val`) and the current maximum value (`curr_max`) to be the first element in the array.\nAt each step, we check whether the current element is greater than the current maximum value. If it is, we update both the maximum value and the current maximum value. Otherwise, we only update the current maximum value.\nIf the current maximum value becomes equal to the maximum value, then we have found a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum. In this case, we return the subarray from the starting index of the left pointer to the ending index of the right pointer.\nIf we reach the end of the array without finding a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum, we return None.\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It also has a space complexity of O(1) since we are only using constant extra space."
