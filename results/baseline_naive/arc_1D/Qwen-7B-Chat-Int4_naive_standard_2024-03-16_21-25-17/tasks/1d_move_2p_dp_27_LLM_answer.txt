Sample Outputs:
The given code uses a simple approach to solve the problem by iterating over each element of the input array and checking if it is equal to zero. If an element is zero, it is replaced with the maximum value in the array that comes before it. This process continues until all elements are non-zero.

Here's how the code works:

```python
def majorityElement(nums):
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    
    max_count = max(count.values())
    result = []
    
    for num in nums:
        if count[num] == max_count:
            result.append(num)
            
    return result
```

In this code, we first initialize an empty dictionary `count` to keep track of the frequency of each number in the input array. We then iterate over each element in the array and update its count in the `count` dictionary.

After counting the frequency of each number, we find the maximum count using the `max()` function. Finally, we iterate over the original array again and add any number whose count matches the maximum count to the `result` list.

For example, consider the input `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]`. The `count` dictionary will look like this after iteration:

```python
{
    0: 4,
    7: 3,
    6: 1
}
```

Since there are more occurrences of 0 than any other number, we replace all instances of 0 with their corresponding counts:

```python
[
    0,
    7,
    7,
    7,
    6,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    0
]
```

We can see that there are now more occurrences of 6 (1) than any other number, so we replace all instances of 6 with their corresponding counts:

```python
[
    0,
    7,
    7,
    7,
    6,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    0
]
```

Finally, we get the output as `[0, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array, since we need to iterate over both the input array and the dictionary to count the frequencies. However, since we only perform one pass over the input array, the space complexity is O(1).
