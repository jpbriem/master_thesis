Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the current window of elements that we are considering. At each step, we update the window by removing the element at index `right` and adding the next element in the array.
We also need to keep track of the maximum value in the window so far. Whenever we encounter an element with a higher value than the current maximum, we update the maximum value and move the right pointer accordingly.
Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    left = 0
    right = 0
    max_val = nums[0]
    curr_max = nums[0]
    
    while right < len(nums):
        if nums[right] > max_val:
            max_val = nums[right]
            curr_max = nums[right]
        else:
            curr_max = max(curr_max, nums[right])
            
        right += 1
        
        if curr_max == max_val:
            return nums[left:right]
        
    return None
```

In this implementation, we initialize the left pointer to 0 and the right pointer to 0. We also initialize the maximum value (`max_val`) and the current maximum value (`curr_max`) to be the first element in the array.
At each step, we check whether the current element is greater than the current maximum value. If it is, we update both the maximum value and the current maximum value. Otherwise, we only update the current maximum value.
If the current maximum value becomes equal to the maximum value, then we have found a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum. In this case, we return the subarray from the starting index of the left pointer to the ending index of the right pointer.
If we reach the end of the array without finding a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum, we return None.
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. It also has a space complexity of O(1) since we are only using constant extra space.
