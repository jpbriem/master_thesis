We will create an array `dp` of the same length as the input array `arr`, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number that can be obtained by removing all occurrences of `i` from `arr`. We can initialize `dp[0] = arr[0]`.\nThen, for each index `i` in `arr`, we can iterate over all indices `j` in `arr` such that `i != j`. If `j > i`, then we cannot remove `j` from `arr` before removing `i`, so `dp[j] <= dp[i]`. Otherwise, if `j < i`, then we can remove `j` from `arr` before removing `i`, and the maximum number that can be obtained is `dp[j] + arr[j]`. Therefore, `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[j])`.\nFinally, the output will be the value stored at `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.\nHere's the Python code to implement this algorithm:\n```python\ndef max_number(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    dp = [0] * n\n\n    # Initialize dp[0] = arr[0]\n    dp[0] = arr[0]\n\n    # Iterate over all indices i in arr\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Iterate over all indices j in arr such that i != j\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            # Check if j > i\n            if j > i:\n                # dp[j] <= dp[i]\n                dp[j] = dp[i]\n            else:\n                # dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[j])\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[j])\n\n    return dp[-1]\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `arr`. However, since we are using dynamic programming, the space complexity is only O(n), which is much better than the naive approach of iterating over all possible combinations of numbers to be removed."
