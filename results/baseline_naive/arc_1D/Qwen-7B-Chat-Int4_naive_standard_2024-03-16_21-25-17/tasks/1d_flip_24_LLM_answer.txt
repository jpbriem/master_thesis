Sample Outputs:
Here is one possible solution in Python:

```python
def find_max_sum(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return 0

    left = []
    right = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        while left and nums[left[-1]] < nums[i]:
            left.pop()
        right.append(i)

    max_sum = nums[right[0]]
    current_sum = nums[right[0]]

    for i in range(1, len(right)):
        current_sum += nums[right[i]]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

    for i in range(left[0], -1, -1):
        current_sum -= nums[left[i]]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

    return max_sum
```

The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, then there are no valid pairs of numbers to add together, so the maximum sum is 0.

Next, the function initializes two empty lists `left` and `right`. The `left` list will store the indices of the largest number on the left side of each pair, and the `right` list will store the indices of the largest number on the right side of each pair.

Then, the function iterates over the input list from left to right. For each number, the function checks if there is a larger number on its left side that can be paired with it to form a larger sum. If such a number exists, the function adds it to the `left` list and updates the current sum to include this number. Otherwise, the function adds the index of the current number to the `right` list.

After all numbers have been processed, the function calculates the maximum sum by iterating over the `right` list in reverse order and adding up the differences between adjacent elements. This gives us the maximum sum that can be formed using only the numbers in the `right` list.

Finally, the function iterates over the `left` list in reverse order and subtracts off the corresponding numbers from the current sum. This gives us the maximum sum that can be formed using only the numbers in the `left` list.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we need to sort both the `left` and `right` lists, which takes O(n log n) time. However, since we only need to do this once per input list, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is still linear in the size of the input list.
