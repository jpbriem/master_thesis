It then finds the element with the highest count and its count. Finally, it checks if there are two elements with the same maximum count, and returns either the element with the highest count or the median of those elements if there are multiple elements with the same maximum count.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that all elements in `nums` have distinct values. If there are duplicate elements in `nums`, the solution will still work correctly but may not produce the expected output."
