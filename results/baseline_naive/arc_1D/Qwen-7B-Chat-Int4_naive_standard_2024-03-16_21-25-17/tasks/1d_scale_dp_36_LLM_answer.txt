Sample Outputs:
Here is an example solution in Python:

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum sum and the current subarray
    max_sum = nums[0]
    start_index = 0

    # Iterate through the array starting from index 1
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # If the current number is greater than or equal to the previous number,
        # update the maximum sum and the start index accordingly
        if nums[i] >= nums[start_index]:
            start_index += 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, reset the start index to be at the beginning of the next subarray
            start_index = i

        # Update the maximum sum
        max_sum = max(max_sum, nums[i] + nums[start_index - 1])

    # Return the maximum sum
    return max_sum
```

This solution works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far. Whenever a new number is encountered that is less than or equal to the previous number, we know that it cannot contribute to the maximum sum, so we reset the start index to be at the beginning of the next subarray. We also keep track of the current subarray using two pointers, one at the end of the subarray (which always points to the most recent element) and one at the start of the subarray (which always points to the first element that was part of the subarray). Finally, we update the maximum sum whenever a new number is encountered that is greater than or equal to the previous number.
