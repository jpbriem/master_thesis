We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, which point to the start of the current window. At each step, we move the left pointer one position to the right if it is not at the end of the array. If the value at the left pointer is zero, we remove all values in the current window and add them to the result array. Otherwise, we check if the sum of the values in the current window is equal to nine. If it is, we add the value at the right pointer to the result array. After moving the right pointer one position to the right, we repeat the process.\nHere's the Python code for solving this problem:\n```python\ndef find_window(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    result = []\n    left = 0\n    while True:\n        # Check if the sum of the values in the current window is equal to nine\n        sum_of_values = sum(arr[left:right+1])\n        if sum_of_values == 9:\n            # Add the value at the right pointer to the result array\n            result.append(arr[right])\n            break\n        elif sum_of_values != 0:\n            # Remove all values in the current window and add them to the result array\n            result.extend(arr[left:right+1])\n            # Move the left pointer one position to the right\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            # The left pointer is at the end of the array, so stop iterating\n            break\n    return result\n```\n\nWe can test the function with the given examples:\n```scss\nprint(find_window([0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]))  # Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(find_window([0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]))  # Output: [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\nprint(find_window([0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n```"
