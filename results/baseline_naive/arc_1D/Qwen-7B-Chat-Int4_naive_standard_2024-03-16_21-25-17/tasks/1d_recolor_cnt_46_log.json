We start with the first element as our initial guess, then iterate through the rest of the elements in the array.\n\nFor each element, we check whether it is smaller than the current largest number (which is stored in `res`). If it is, we pop the top of the stack and add it to `res`, since this means that there must be a larger number somewhere earlier in the array that is less than `res`. We then push the current element onto the stack so that we can continue checking for larger numbers later on.\n\nAfter iterating through all of the elements in the array, we have found the maximum possible value that can be represented using only the digits in the input array. The final result is returned as `res`.\n\nNote that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we need to iterate over every element in the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), since we need to store the current largest number in a stack."
