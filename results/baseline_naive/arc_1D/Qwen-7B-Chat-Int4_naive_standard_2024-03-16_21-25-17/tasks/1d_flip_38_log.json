The `visited` set keeps track of which nodes have already been visited so we don't visit them again. We also use a `stack` to keep track of the current path.\n\nAt each step, we pop an element from the stack and check if it has any connections to the unvisited nodes. If it does, we add those nodes to the `visited` set and push their neighbors onto the stack. If the current node is connected to all other nodes, we know that we've found a cut and increment the `cut_count`.\n\nAfter traversing the entire graph, we return the `cut_count`."
