Sample Outputs:
Here is a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def longestSubsequence(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # base cases
    dp[0][0], dp[0][-1] = 1, 1
    
    # fill in dp table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i - 1] == nums[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1
                
            elif dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
                
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
                
    # find the maximum length of subsequence
    max_len = max(dp[-1])
    start_index = dp.index(max_len)
    
    return nums[start_index : start_index + max_len]
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to build a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The base cases are `dp[0][0] = 1` and `dp[0][-1] = 1`, which represent the empty sequence and the single element sequence. 

For each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `i > j`, we check whether `nums[i - 1]` equals `nums[j]`. If it does, then we can extend the longest increasing subsequence ending at `j` by adding `nums[i - 1]` to it, so we set `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1`.

If `nums[i - 1]` does not equal `nums[j]`, but `dp[i - 1][j]` is greater than or equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then we know that the longest increasing subsequence ending at `j` ends at `i - 1`, so we set `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]`.

Otherwise, if `nums[i - 1]` does not equal `nums[j]` and `dp[i - 1][j]` is less than `dp[i][j - 1]`, then we know that the longest increasing subsequence ending at `j` ends at `i`, so we set `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`.

Finally, we find the maximum value in `dp[-1]`, which gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input array. We also keep track of the starting index of this subsequence using `start_index`, and return the corresponding elements from the input array.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), since there are n pairs of indices and each pair takes constant time to process. However, since the space complexity is only O(n), this solution should be efficient enough for most practical purposes.
