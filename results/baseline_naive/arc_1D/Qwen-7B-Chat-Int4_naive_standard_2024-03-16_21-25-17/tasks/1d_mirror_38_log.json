We will have one pointer that starts from the beginning of the input array and another pointer that starts from the end of the input array.\n\nWe will keep moving the first pointer towards the right until it reaches a non-zero element, and then move the second pointer towards the left until it reaches a zero element. At each step, we will swap the elements at these pointers if they are different.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef maxSubarray(nums):\n    # Move the first pointer towards the right until it reaches a non-zero element\n    while nums[0] == 0:\n        nums.pop(0)\n    \n    # Move the second pointer towards the left until it reaches a zero element\n    i = len(nums) - 1\n    while nums[i] == 0:\n        nums.pop(i)\n    \n    # Swap the elements at the current pointers\n    nums[0], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[0]\n    \n    # Continue swapping the elements until the first pointer is no longer at the start\n    while i > 0 and nums[i] != 0:\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and nums[j] == 0:\n            nums[j], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[j]\n            j -= 1\n    \n    return nums\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we only need to traverse the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we may need to store all the elements in the input array in memory during the process of swapping them."
