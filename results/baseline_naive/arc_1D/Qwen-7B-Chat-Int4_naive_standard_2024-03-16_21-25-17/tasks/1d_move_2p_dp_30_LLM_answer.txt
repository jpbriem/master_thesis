```

Explanation:

- We first check that the input is valid. If it's not, we simply return 0.
- We then initialize two arrays `island_count_row` and `island_count_col`, where `island_count_row[i]` represents the number of islands in the ith row and `island_count_col[j]` represents the number of islands in the jth column. These arrays will be used to keep track of the number of islands in each row and column.
- Next, we initialize another array `visited_matrix` with size `(m x n)` and set all its values to False. This array will be used to keep track of which cells have been visited during the DFS algorithm.
- We also initialize an array `max_depth` with size `(m x n)` and set all its values to 1. This array will be used to keep track of the maximum depth of the connected components.
- We then perform a DFS algorithm starting from the cell (i, j) whose value is 1 and has not been visited yet. During the dfs function, we update `island_count_row[i]`, `island_count_col[j]`, `visited_matrix[i][j]`, and `max_depth[i]`.
- Finally, we count the number of islands by adding up all the elements of `island_count_row`.
