                r, c = row + dx, col + dy
                
                # If neighbor is within the boundaries of the grid and hasn't been visited yet
                if 0 <= r < n and 0 <= c < m and not visited[r][c]:
                    queue.append((r, c))
                    visited[r][c] = True
                    
        return start_row * start_col
```

Explanation:

- We first define a list `directions` which contains the possible movements that we can make on the grid.
- We then check if the input grid has any rows or columns. If it doesn't, there are no islands to be found, so we return 0.
- Next, we use the `find_islands` function to find the starting island. This function takes the grid as an argument and returns the row and column indices of the starting island.
- We initialize a boolean array `visited` with dimensions `(n x m)` where each element represents whether or not its corresponding cell has been visited. We also create a queue `queue` and add the starting island to it.
- In the main loop, we dequeue the next island from the queue and mark it as visited by setting the corresponding element in the `visited` array to True.
- Then, we check all four neighboring cells of the current island using the `directions` list. For each neighboring cell, we calculate its new coordinates based on the current position of the island, and check if it's within the bounds of the grid and hasn't been visited before. If it meets these criteria, we enqueue it into the queue and mark it as visited.
- Finally, when the loop finishes, we return the number of starting islands multiplied by their respective row and column indices.

Note: The `find_islands` function is not provided in this solution, but you can implement it yourself using a similar approach to finding connected components in a graph.
