We will have one pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and another pointer that starts at the end of the array. At each step, we will swap the elements pointed by these pointers if they are not equal to zero.\nHere is the Python code for this solution:\n\n```python\ndef three_sum(nums):\n    i = 0\n    j = len(nums) - 1\n\n    while i < j:\n        sum = nums[i] + nums[j]\n        if sum == 0:\n            return [nums[i], nums[j]]\n        elif sum > 0:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    \n    return []\n```\n\nWe start with two pointers `i` and `j`, where `i` points to the first element of the array and `j` points to the last element of the array. We then enter a loop that continues until `i` is greater than or equal to `j`.\nAt each iteration of the loop, we calculate the sum of the current elements pointed by `i` and `j`. If the sum is equal to zero, we return `[nums[i], nums[j]]`, which represents the pair of numbers that add up to zero.\nIf the sum is greater than zero, we increment `i` to move towards the next element in the array. This is because we want to find pairs of numbers whose sum is less than zero.\nIf the sum is less than zero, we decrement `j` to move towards the previous element in the array. This is because we want to find pairs of numbers whose sum is greater than zero.\nOnce the loop completes, we return an empty list if no such pairs were found."
