We initialize dp[i][j] as -infinity for all i and j.\n\nWe then iterate over each element in the input array. For each element at index i, we check if it is equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, we update dp[i][i] to be the current value of i. If it is equal to 0, we have two options:\n\n- We can remove the element from the array and update dp[i][j] to be the maximum sum that can be obtained by removing all elements from i to j.\n- We can leave the element in place and update dp[i][j+1] to be the maximum sum that can be obtained by removing all elements from i to j+1.\n\nFinally, we return the maximum sum that can be obtained by removing all elements from the entire array, which will be stored in dp[n][n].\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this solution:\n\n```python\ndef maxSumSubarray(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    dp = [[float('-inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n)]\n    dp[0][0] = nums[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        dp[i][0] = nums[i]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + nums[i]\n    return max(dp[n-1])\n```\n\nThis code has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. It also has a space complexity of O(n^2), since we are using a two-dimensional array to store the maximum sums."
