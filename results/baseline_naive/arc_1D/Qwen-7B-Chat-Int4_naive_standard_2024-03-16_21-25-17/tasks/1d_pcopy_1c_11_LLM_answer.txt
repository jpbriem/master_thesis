Sample Outputs:
Here is a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # initialize first row and column with 1s
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # fill in rest of matrix using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1):
            if nums[j - 1] > nums[j]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
    
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to build up an array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. We initialize the first row and column of `dp` with 1s, since any sequence containing only one element has length 1. Then we fill in the rest of `dp` by comparing each pair of elements from left to right.

For example, consider the input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The first row of `dp` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, since there are no two adjacent elements that differ in value. For the second row, we compare the last element of the previous row (`1`) with the first element of the current row (`0`). Since `1` is greater than `0`, we set `dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] + 1`, which gives us `2`. We continue this process until we have filled in all the rows of `dp`.

Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence can be found by looking at the last element of `dp`, which contains the total number of increasing subsequences of length `n`.
