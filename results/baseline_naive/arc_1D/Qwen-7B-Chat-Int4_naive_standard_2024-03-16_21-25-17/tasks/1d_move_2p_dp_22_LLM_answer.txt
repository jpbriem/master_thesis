Sample Outputs:
Here's one way to implement the function in Python:

```python
def find_max_value(nums):
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1

    # Initialize the maximum value to be the first non-zero number
    max_val = nums[0]

    # Iterate over the remaining numbers and update the maximum value as needed
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            if nums[i] > max_val:
                max_val = nums[i]
            elif nums[i] == max_val:
                # If there are multiple occurrences of the maximum value, keep track of their indices
                freq[max_val].append(i)

    # Return the maximum value along with its indices
    return (max_val, freq[max_val])
```

The `find_max_value` function takes an array of integers `nums` as input. It first creates a dictionary called `freq` to store the frequency of each number in the array.

It then initializes the maximum value to be the first non-zero number in the array.

Next, it iterates over the remaining numbers in the array and updates the maximum value as needed. For each number that is not zero, it checks whether it is greater than or equal to the current maximum value. If so, it sets the maximum value to be the new number. If the new number is equal to the current maximum value, it adds its index to a list stored in the `freq` dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the maximum value along with its indices.

For example, running `find_max_value([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0])` would output `(9, [5, 6])`, indicating that the maximum value is 9 and it appears at indices 5 and 6.
