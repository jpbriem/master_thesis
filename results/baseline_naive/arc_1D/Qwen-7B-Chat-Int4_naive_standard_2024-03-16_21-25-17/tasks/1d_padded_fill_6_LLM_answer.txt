Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create an array `dp` of the same length as the input array and initialize all its elements to 0. Then we will iterate through the input array from left to right.
For each element at index i in the input array, we will check if it is equal to 0 or not. If it is equal to 0, then we know that there are no more 0s after it, so we can simply copy the value of the previous non-zero element (if any) to the current position in `dp`. Otherwise, if it is not equal to 0, then we need to consider the possibility of having 0s after it.
We can do this by checking if the next element in the input array is also equal to 0. If it is, then we know that there is only one 0 after the current element, so we can set the value of the current position in `dp` to be the value of the previous non-zero element (if any). Otherwise, if the next element is not equal to 0, then we know that there may be multiple 0s after the current element, so we need to recursively call the function on the remaining part of the input array starting from the next element.
Here's the Python code for the solution:
```python
def count_zeros(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n

    # base cases
    if nums[0] == 0:
        return dp[0]
    elif nums[0] != 0:
        dp[0] = nums[0]

    # recursive case
    for i in range(1, n):
        if nums[i] == 0:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1])

    return dp[-1]
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we only need to iterate through the input array once. The space complexity is also O(n), which is required to store the output array `dp`.
