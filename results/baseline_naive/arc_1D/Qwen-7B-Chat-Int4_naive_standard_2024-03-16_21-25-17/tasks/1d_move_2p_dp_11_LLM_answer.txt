Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach. We will iterate through each element of the input array and check if it is equal to 0 or 1. If an element is equal to 0, we will set all elements in its row and column to 0 as well. If an element is equal to 1, we will set all elements in its row and column to 1 as well.
Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
def find_pattern(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    pattern = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

    def dfs(i, j):
        nonlocal visited, pattern

        if i < 0 or i >= n or j < 0 or j >= n or arr[i][j] != 1:
            return

        visited[i][j] = True
        pattern[i][j] = True

        dfs(i - 1, j)
        dfs(i + 1, j)
        dfs(i, j - 1)
        dfs(i, j + 1)

    dfs(0, 0)

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                continue

            if pattern[i][j]:
                result.append(1)
            else:
                result.append(0)

    return result
```

The `find_pattern` function takes an input array `arr` as input and returns a list representing the pattern found in the array. The function first initializes two lists `visited` and `pattern` to keep track of which elements have been visited and whether they are part of the pattern respectively.

Then, the function defines a helper function `dfs` that performs depth-first search on the input array starting from the top-left corner. In each iteration of the loop, the function checks if the current element is 1 or 0. If it is 1, the function sets all elements in its row and column to 1 as well and recursively calls itself with the next unvisited neighbor. If it is 0, the function simply skips over the current element.

After calling the `dfs` function once at the start of the algorithm, the function iterates through each element of the input array again and appends either 1 or 0 to the `result` list depending on whether the corresponding element has been visited or not.

Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing the pattern found in the input array.
