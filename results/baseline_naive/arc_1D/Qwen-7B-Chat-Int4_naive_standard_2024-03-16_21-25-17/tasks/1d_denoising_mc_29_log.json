We start by initializing all elements of the array as -1.\n\nThen, we iterate through the input array from left to right and top to bottom. For each element, we check if it is equal to 0 or greater than the current maximum number in its row. If so, we update the maximum number for that row. If the element is less than 0, we ignore it.\n\nFinally, we iterate through the array again and return an array containing only the elements that are equal to their corresponding maximum numbers.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef max_number(arr):\n    rows = len(arr)\n    cols = len(arr[0])\n\n    # Initialize all elements as -1\n    result = [[-1] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Iterate through the input array\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            num = arr[i][j]\n            if num >= 0:\n                # Update the maximum number for this row\n                result[i][j] = num\n\n    # Return the result array\n    return [[row[j] for row in result] for j in range(len(result[0]))]\n```\n\nUsing this function on the given examples returns the expected output:\n\n```python\nprint(max_number([0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n# Output: [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nprint(max_number([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]))\n# Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\nprint(max_number([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))\n# Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```"
