The base cases are `dp[0][0] = 1` and `dp[0][-1] = 1`, which represent the empty sequence and the single element sequence. \n\nFor each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `i > j`, we check whether `nums[i - 1]` equals `nums[j]`. If it does, then we can extend the longest increasing subsequence ending at `j` by adding `nums[i - 1]` to it, so we set `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1`.\n\nIf `nums[i - 1]` does not equal `nums[j]`, but `dp[i - 1][j]` is greater than or equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then we know that the longest increasing subsequence ending at `j` ends at `i - 1`, so we set `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]`.\n\nOtherwise, if `nums[i - 1]` does not equal `nums[j]` and `dp[i - 1][j]` is less than `dp[i][j - 1]`, then we know that the longest increasing subsequence ending at `j` ends at `i`, so we set `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`.\n\nFinally, we find the maximum value in `dp[-1]`, which gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input array. We also keep track of the starting index of this subsequence using `start_index`, and return the corresponding elements from the input array.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), since there are n pairs of indices and each pair takes constant time to process. However, since the space complexity is only O(n), this solution should be efficient enough for most practical purposes."
