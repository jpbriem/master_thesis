Sample Outputs:
Here is one way to solve the problem in Python:

```python
def longest_consecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    
    nums.sort()
    start = end = nums[0]
    result = [start]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        if num == start + 1:
            end += 1
        else:
            start = num
            
        result.append(start)
        
    result.append(end)
    
    return result
```

This solution works by first sorting the input array in ascending order. Then it initializes two variables `start` and `end`, which represent the starting and ending indices of the current consecutive subarray. The variable `result` is initialized as a list containing just the value of `start`.

The algorithm then iterates over the remaining elements of the sorted array. For each element, it checks whether it is equal to `start + 1`. If so, it increments `end` and updates `start` to be the next element. Otherwise, it sets `start` to be the current element.

Finally, the function appends `start` and `end` to the `result` list and returns the final `result` list.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the input array must be sorted before the algorithm can begin searching for consecutive subarrays. However, since the problem only requires finding the maximum length of any consecutive subarray, the time complexity could potentially be reduced to O(n) using a different approach.
