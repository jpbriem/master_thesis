Here is a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def split_to_blocks(lst):
    # Create an empty list to store the blocks
    blocks = []
    
    # Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the list
    left = 0
    right = len(lst) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        # If the left pointer points to an even number,
        # add all odd numbers from the left to the current position to the block
        if lst[left] % 2 == 0:
            i = left + 1
            while i <= right and lst[i] % 2 != 0:
                blocks.append(lst[i])
                i += 1
            
        # Otherwise, add all even numbers from the left to the current position to the block
        else:
            i = left + 1
            while i <= right and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
                blocks.append(lst[i])
                i += 1
        
        # Move the left pointer forward by 2
        left += 2
        
        # Move the right pointer forward by 2
        right -= 2
    
    return blocks

# Test cases
print(split_to_blocks([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
print(split_to_blocks([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]))  # Output: [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]
print(split_to_blocks([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This solution works by iterating over the input list using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start at opposite ends of the list. At each iteration, it checks whether the element pointed to by `left` is even or odd. If it's even, it adds all odd elements from `left` to `right` to the block, and then moves `left` forward by 2. If it's odd, it adds all even elements from `left` to `right` to the block, and then moves `right` forward by 2. This process continues until either `left` or `right` reaches the end of the list. Finally, the function returns the list of blocks.
