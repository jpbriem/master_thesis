We will maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the start and end of the current window respectively.\nAt each step, we will check if there is a 0 in the current window. If there is, we will move the left pointer to the right until it finds a non-zero element. This will ensure that the next window always starts with a non-zero element.\nIf there are no zeros in the current window, we will simply move the right pointer one position to the right. This will ensure that the next window has at least one element.\nOnce the right pointer reaches the end of the input array, we will have processed all the windows. The elements in the output array will be the ones that were not moved during the processing.\nHere's the Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\ndef longestZeroSubsequence(nums):\n    left = right = 0\n\n    result = []\n    while right < len(nums):\n        if nums[right] == 0:\n            while left <= right and nums[left] == 0:\n                left += 1\n            if left > right:\n                break\n            else:\n                result.append(nums[left])\n                right += 1\n        else:\n            right += 1\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is also O(1) as we only need to store the result array."
