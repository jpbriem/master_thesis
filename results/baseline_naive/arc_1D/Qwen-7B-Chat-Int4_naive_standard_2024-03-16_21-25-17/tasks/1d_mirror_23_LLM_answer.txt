Explanation:

- We initialize three pointers `i`, `j` and `k` to keep track of the indices of the first, last and current elements respectively.
- We iterate through the array using the `while` loop. In each iteration, we move `j` forward until it encounters an element greater than `nums[i]`. This is done because we want to find the index of the next smallest element after `nums[i]`.
- If `j-i>0`, then there are at least two elements between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`. So, we increment the number of chunks by `(j-i+1)` and update `num_chunks`.
- Similarly, we move `k` forward until it encounters an element less than `nums[i]`. This is done because we want to find the index of the next largest element before `nums[i]`.
- If `k-i>0`, then there are at least two elements between `nums[i]` and `nums[k]`. So, we add `k-i+1` to the total number of chunks and update `num_chunks`.
- After moving both `j` and `k` forward, we increment `i` so that we start processing the next element in the array.
- Finally, when `i` becomes equal to `k`, we have processed all the elements in the array and return the number of chunks.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) since we need to traverse the array twice, once for finding the minimum and maximum values and again for counting the number of chunks. However, this can be optimized further by using binary search instead of linear search to find the minimum and maximum values, which will reduce the time complexity to O(n log n).
