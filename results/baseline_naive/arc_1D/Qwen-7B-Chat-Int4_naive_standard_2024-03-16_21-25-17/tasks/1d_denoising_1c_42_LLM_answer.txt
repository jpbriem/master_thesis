Sample Outputs:
Here is a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def majorityElement(nums):
    # Count the number of occurrences of each element in nums
    counts = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num not in counts:
            counts[num] = 0
        counts[num] += 1
    
    # Find the element with the highest count and its count
    max_count = 0
    max_num = None
    for num, count in counts.items():
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            max_num = num
    
    # Check if there are two elements with the same maximum count
    has_duplicate = False
    for num, count in counts.items():
        if count == max_count and num != max_num:
            has_duplicate = True
    
    # If there are no two elements with the same maximum count or only one element,
    # return that element as the majority element
    if not has_duplicate or max_count == 1:
        return max_num
    
    # Otherwise, there are two or more elements with the same maximum count.
    # Return the median of those elements as the majority element
    sorted_counts = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    mid = len(sorted_counts) // 2
    median = sorted_counts[mid][0]
    
    return median
```

This solution first counts the number of occurrences of each element in `nums`. It then finds the element with the highest count and its count. Finally, it checks if there are two elements with the same maximum count, and returns either the element with the highest count or the median of those elements if there are multiple elements with the same maximum count.

Note that this solution assumes that all elements in `nums` have distinct values. If there are duplicate elements in `nums`, the solution will still work correctly but may not produce the expected output.
