We then loop through the array using two pointers `left` and `right`, keeping track of the start and end of the current chunk.\n\nInside the loop, we find the maximum frequency element in the `freq_dict`. If this element has no occurrences left in the array, we remove it from the dictionary. We then move the `left` pointer to the next position where there is at least one occurrence of this element.\n\nNext, we move the `right` pointer to the next position where there are still occurrences of this element. After this step, we check if there are any elements left in the left chunk that need to be sorted. If so, we calculate the number of elements left in the left chunk and the number of chunks required to sort the entire array by dividing the number of elements left by the size of the remaining unsorted portion of the array plus one (to account for the fact that we have already processed this element). Finally, we subtract one from the result if the number of elements left is less than four (since we can't create a separate chunk with fewer than three elements).\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), since we are sorting the array in linear time and performing frequent lookups in the dictionary. The space complexity is also O(n), since we are storing the frequency of each element in the array."
