```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        if not strs:
            return []
        
        d = {}
        for s in strs:
            key = ''.join(sorted(s))
            if key in d:
                d[key].append(s)
            else:
                d[key] = [s]
                
        res = [[] for _ in range(len(d))]
        for k, v in d.items():
            res[v[0]] += v[1:]
            
        return res
```

Explanation:

The problem statement requires us to group anagrams together. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary `d` to store the sorted keys and their corresponding values (which are lists of words that have those keys). We iterate over each word `s`, sort its characters into a string `key`, and then check whether `key` already exists as a key in `d`. If it does, we append `s` to the list of words with that key; otherwise, we create a new entry in `d` with `key` set to `[s]`.

After iterating over all words, we can initialize a list `res` with empty lists for each unique key in `d`. Then, we iterate over each value `v` in `d`, which contains the list of words with that key. For each value, we append all the elements of the list to the corresponding element in `res`.

Finally, we return `res`, which contains one list per unique key in `d`, representing the groups of anagrams.

In the test cases provided, the input strings contain only lowercase letters, so we don't need to worry about sorting them first. However, if the input strings could contain uppercase letters or other characters, we would need to modify our solution to handle them correctly.
