```

Explanation:

The `permute` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of permutations. It first checks if the length of the input list is zero, which means there are no elements to permute. In this case, it returns an empty list.

If the length of the input list is greater than zero, it initializes an empty list called `res`. For each integer in the input list, it appends it to every possible position in `res`.

It then calls the `dfs` function with the initial path being an empty list, the visited set being an empty set, and the result list being initially empty.

The `dfs` function takes three arguments: the current path, the visited set, and the result list. It first checks if the length of the current path is equal to the length of the visited set. If so, it appends the current path to the result list.

For each index in the current path from right to left, it checks if the element at that index has not been visited yet. If not, it adds it to the visited set and recursively calls itself with the updated path and visited set.

Finally, the `dfs` function pops the last element from the visited set to backtrack and explore other possibilities. The function continues until all possible paths have been explored and the result list contains all permutations.
