If both conditions are true, we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is not '.' and the previous character is not 'a', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is '.' and the previous character is not 'a', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'a' and the previous character is 'a', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'a' and the previous character is 'b', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'a' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'b' and the previous character is 'b', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'b' and the previous character is 'a', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'b' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'a', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'b', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'b', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character

to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIf the current character is 'e' and the previous character is 'e', we add the current character to the output list and move
