Explanation:


In this code, we, check, if, the, both, conditions, are, true, we, add, the, current, character, to, the, output, list.

In the, eighty, check, if, the, conditions, are, true, we, add, the, output, list.

In, this, code, we, check, if, the, and, the, previous, character, are, both, conditions, true, we, add, the, current, character, to, the, output, list.

In, check, if, the, and, the, conditions, are, true, both, we, add, the, current, character, output,
