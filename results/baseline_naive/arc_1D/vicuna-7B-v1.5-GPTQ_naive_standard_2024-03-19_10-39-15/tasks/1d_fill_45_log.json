(i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.\n\nIn the second step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.\n\nIn the third step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.\n\nIn the fourth step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.\n\nIn the fifth step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.\n\nIn the sixth step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.\n\nIn the seventh step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.'
