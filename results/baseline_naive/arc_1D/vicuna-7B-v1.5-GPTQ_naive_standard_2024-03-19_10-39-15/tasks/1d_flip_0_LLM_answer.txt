Explanation:
In the first step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels in the string. We can do this by counting the number of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' in the string.

For example, in the first test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, so we can set the maximum number of vowels to 4.

In the second step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants in the string. We can do this by counting the number of 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'v', 'w', and 'x' in the string.

For example, in the second test case, there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants to 3.
