Explanation:
In the first step, we check if the current cell is a '.' and if it is, we check if the previous cell is a '.' as well. If it is, we check if the previous previous cell is a '.' as well. If all three conditions are met, we recursively call the function with the current cell as the first parameter and the previous cell as the second parameter. If any of the conditions is not met, we continue with the next cell.
