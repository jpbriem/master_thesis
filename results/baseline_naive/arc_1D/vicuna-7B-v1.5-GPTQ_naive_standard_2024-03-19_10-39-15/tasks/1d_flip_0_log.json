We can do this by counting the number of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' in the string.\n\nFor example, in the first test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, so we can set the maximum number of vowels to 4.\n\nIn the second step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants in the string. We can do this by counting the number of 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'v', 'w', and 'x' in the string.\n\nFor example, in the second test case, there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants to 3.\n\nIn the third step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a consonant. We can do this by subtracting the number of consonants from the number of vowels.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, and there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a consonant to 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nIn the fourth step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a vowel. We can do this by subtracting the number of vowels from the number of consonants.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, and there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a vowel to 3 - 4 = -1.\n\nIn the fifth step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant. We can do this by subtracting the number of consonants from the number of consonants.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant to 3.\n\nIn the sixth step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel. We can do this by subtracting the number of vowels from the number of vowels.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, so we can set the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel to 4.\n\nIn the seventh step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant. We can do this by subtracting the number of consonants from the number of consonants.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant to 3.\n\nIn the eighth step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel. We can do this by subtracting the number of vowels from the number of vowels.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, so we can set the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel to 4.\n\nIn the ninth step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant. We can do this by subtracting the number of consonants from the number of consonants.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant to 3.\n\nIn the tenth step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel. We can do this by subtracting the number of vowels from the number of vowels.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 4 vowels in the string, so we can set the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel to 4.\n\nIn the eleventh step, we need to find the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant. We can do this by subtracting the number of consonants from the number of consonants.\n\nFor example, in the third test case, there are 3 consonants in the string, so we can set the maximum number of consonants that can be replaced by a consonant to 3.\n\nIn the twelfth step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels that can be replaced by a vowel.
