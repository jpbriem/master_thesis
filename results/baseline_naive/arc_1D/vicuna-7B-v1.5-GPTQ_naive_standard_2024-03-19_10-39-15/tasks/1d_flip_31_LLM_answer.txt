Explanation:
In the first step, we find the maximum sum of the elements in the current row and column.
We then move to the row and column with the maximum sum and find the maximum sum of the elements in the current row and column.
We repeat this process until we find the maximum sum of the elements in the entire matrix.
We then return the maximum sum of the elements in the entire matrix.
