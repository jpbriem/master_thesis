If it is '.' or 'c', we move to the next step. If it is not '.' or 'c', we move to the next step.\nIn the second step, we check if the current character is 'b'. If it is 'b', we move to the next step. If it is not 'b', we move to the next step.\nIn the third step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.\nIn the fourth step, we check if the current character is 'i'. If it is 'i', we move to the next step. If it is not 'i', we move to the next step.\nIn the fifth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step.\nIn the sixth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.\nIn the seventh step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step.\nIn the eighth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.\nIn the ninth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step.\nIn the tenth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
