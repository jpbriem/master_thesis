Explanation:
In the first step, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the input string. In this case, there are 5 consecutive 'g's, so we move 5 steps forward.
In the second step, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 4 consecutive 'g's, so we move 4 steps forward.
In the third step, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward again. In this case, there are 3 consecutive 'g's, so we move 3 steps forward.
We repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we move 3 steps forward and find 2 consecutive 'g's, so we move 2 steps forward again.
Finally, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward again. In this case, there are 1 consecutive 'g', so we move 1 step forward.
We repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we move 1 step forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.
We then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.
We repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we stop moving forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.
