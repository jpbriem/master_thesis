Explanation:
In the first step, we check if the current character is '.' or 'c'. If it is '.' or 'c', we move to the next step. If it is not '.' or 'c', we move to the next step.
In the second step, we check if the current character is 'b'. If it is 'b', we move to the next step. If it is not 'b', we move to the next step.
In the third step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
In the fourth step, we check if the current character is 'i'. If it is 'i', we move to the next step. If it is not 'i', we move to the next step.
In the fifth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
In the sixth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
In the seventh step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
In the eighth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
In the ninth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'i' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
In the tenth step, we check if the current character is '.'. If it is '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have already seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step. If it is not '.' and we have not seen 'b' in the previous step, we move to the next step.
