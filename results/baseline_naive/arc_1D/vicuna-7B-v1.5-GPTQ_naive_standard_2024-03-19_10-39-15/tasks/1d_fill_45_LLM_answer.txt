Explanation:
In the first step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.

In the second step, we check if the current character is 'e' and if the previous character is '.' (i.e., we have a '.' at the beginning of the string). If this is the case, we add 'e' to the result string and move to the next character.
