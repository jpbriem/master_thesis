can do this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.\nFor example, if the current sum is 1 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 2 (1 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 2 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 3 (2 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 3 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 4 (3 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 4 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 5 (4 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 5 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 6 (5 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 6 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 7 (6 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 7 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 8 (7 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 8 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 9 (8 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 9 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 10 (9 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 10 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 11 (10 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 11 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 12 (11 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 12 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 13 (12 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 13 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 14 (13 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 14 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 15 (14 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 15 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 16 (15 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 16 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 17 (16 + 1).\nIf the current sum is 17 and the next character is 'a', we can
