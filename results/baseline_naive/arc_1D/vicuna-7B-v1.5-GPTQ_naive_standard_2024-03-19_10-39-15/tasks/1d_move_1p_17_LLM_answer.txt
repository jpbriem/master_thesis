Explanation:
In the first step, we find the maximum sum of any prefix of the given string.
We can do this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the maximum sum seen so far.
For example, if the current sum is 1 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 2 (1 + 1).
If the current sum is 2 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 3 (2 + 1).
If the current sum is 3 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 4 (3 + 1).
If the current sum is 4 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 5 (4 + 1).
If the current sum is 5 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 6 (5 + 1).
If the current sum is 6 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 7 (6 + 1).
If the current sum is 7 and the next character is 'a', we can update the maximum sum to 8 (7 + 1).
