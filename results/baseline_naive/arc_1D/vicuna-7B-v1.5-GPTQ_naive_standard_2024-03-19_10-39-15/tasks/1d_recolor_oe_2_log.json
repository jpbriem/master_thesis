In this case, there are 5 consecutive 'g's, so we move 5 steps forward.\nIn the second step, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 4 consecutive 'g's, so we move 4 steps forward.\nIn the third step, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward again. In this case, there are 3 consecutive 'g's, so we move 3 steps forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we move 3 steps forward and find 2 consecutive 'g's, so we move 2 steps forward again.\nFinally, we find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward again. In this case, there are 1 consecutive 'g', so we move 1 step forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we move 1 step forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we stop moving forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we stop moving forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we stop moving forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we stop moving forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward. In this case, there are 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe repeat this process until we reach the end of the input string. In this case, we stop moving forward and find 0 consecutive 'g's, so we stop moving forward.\nWe then find the maximum number of consecutive 'g's in the string after moving forward.
