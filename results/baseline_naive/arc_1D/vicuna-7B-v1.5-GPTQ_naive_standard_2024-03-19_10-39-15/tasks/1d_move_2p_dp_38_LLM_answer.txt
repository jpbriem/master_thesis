Explanation:
In the first step, we need to find the maximum number of consecutive '.' in the input string.
We can do this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the maximum number of consecutive '.' we have seen so far.
We can use a variable to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive '.' and initialize it to 0.
We can then iterate through the string and check if the current character is '.' and the previous character is also '.' and the maximum number of consecutive '.' is less than the current number of consecutive '.' then we update the maximum number of consecutive '.' with the current number of consecutive '.' and the previous character with the current character.
We can then check if the current character is '.' and the maximum number of consecutive '.' is equal to the current number of consecutive '.' then we update the maximum number of consecutive '.' with the current number of consecutive '.' and the previous character with the current character.
We can then check if the current character is '.' and the maximum number of consecutive '.' is greater than the current number of consecutive '.' then we update the maximum number of consecutive '.' with the current number of consecutive '.' and the previous character with the current character.
We can then check if the current character is '.' and the maximum number of consecutive '.' is equal to the current number of consecutive '.' then we update the maximum number of consecutive '.' with the current number of consecutive '.' and the previous character with the current character.
