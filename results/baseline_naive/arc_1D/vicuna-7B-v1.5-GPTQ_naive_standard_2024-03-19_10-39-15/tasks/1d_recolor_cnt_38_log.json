If both conditions are true, we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character. If the current character is 'c' and the previous character is not 'c', we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character. If the current character is not 'c', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIn the second step, we check if the current character is 'c' and if the previous character is 'c'. If both conditions are true, we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character. If the current character is 'c' and the previous character is not 'c', we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character. If the current character is not 'c', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIn the third step, we check if the current character is 'c' and if the previous character is 'c'. If both conditions are true, we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character. If the current character is 'c' and the previous character is not 'c', we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character. If the current character is not 'c', we add the current character to the output list and move to the next character.\n\nIn the fourth step, we check if the current character is 'c' and if the previous character is 'c'. If both conditions are true, we add 'c' to the output list and move to the next character.
