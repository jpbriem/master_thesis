LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'g', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'g', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'g', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'g', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a simple rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current element in the input sequence is 'a', then it should be replaced with itself (no change).
2. Otherwise, if the current element in the input sequence is not 'a', then it should be replaced with its next occurrence in the input sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first two elements are both 'h', so they are replaced with 'a'. Then, the next three elements are all 'a', so they remain unchanged. Finally, the last two elements are 'g' and 'a', respectively, so their positions are swapped.

Similarly, in Example_2, the first two elements are both 'd', so they are replaced with 'a'. Then, the next three elements are all 'a', so they remain unchanged. Finally, the last two elements are 'g' and 'a', respectively, so their positions are swapped.

In Test case, the first two elements are both 'f', so they are replaced with 'a'. Then, the next three elements are all 'a', so they remain unchanged. Finally, the last two elements are 'g' and 'a', respectively, so their positions are swapped.

Solution:
['a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'g', 'a']
