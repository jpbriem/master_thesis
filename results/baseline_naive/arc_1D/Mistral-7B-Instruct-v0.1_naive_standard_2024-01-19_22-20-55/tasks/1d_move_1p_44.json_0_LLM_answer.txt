LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a simple rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current element in the input sequence is not equal to the previous element, then it should be placed at the beginning of the output sequence. Otherwise, it should be placed at the end of the output sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first three elements ('h', 'h', 'h') are all equal, so they are placed at the end of the output sequence. The next four elements ('a', 'a', 'a', 'a') are also all equal, so they are placed at the end of the output sequence. Finally, the last element ('a') is placed at the beginning of the output sequence because it is not equal to any of the previous elements.

Similarly, in Example_2, the first three elements ('d', 'd', 'd') are all equal, so they are placed at the end of the output sequence. The next four elements ('a', 'a', 'a', 'a') are also all equal, so they are placed at the end of the output sequence. Finally, the last element ('a') is placed at the beginning of the output sequence because it is not equal to any of the previous elements.

In Test case, the first three elements ('f', 'f', 'f') are all equal, so they are placed at the end of the output sequence. The next four elements ('a', 'a', 'a', 'a') are also all equal, so they are placed at the end of the output sequence. Finally, the last element ('a') is placed at the beginning of the output sequence because it is not equal to any of the previous elements.

Solution:
['a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a']
