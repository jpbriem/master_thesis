LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'h', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['h', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['g', 'g', 'g', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input sequence, where the first element is fixed at position 0 and all other elements are permuted in descending order. In Example_1, the first element is 'a' and all other elements are permuted in descending order. Similarly, in Example_2, the first element is 'a' and all other elements are permuted in descending order. In Example_3, the first element is 'h' and all other elements are permuted in descending order. Finally, in Test case, the first element is 'a' and all other elements are permuted in descending order.

### 4.2.2.2. Transformation Patterns for Input Sequences with Different Lengths

In this section, we discuss the transformation patterns for input sequences with different lengths. We consider two cases: (1) when the length of the input sequence is less than or equal to 5, and (2) when the length of the input sequence is greater than 5.

Case 1: When the length of the input sequence is less than or equal to 5.

We can apply the same transformation pattern as discussed in Section 4.2.2.1. For example, if the input sequence has length 6, then we fix the first element at position 0 and permute the remaining elements in descending order. If the input sequence has length 7, then we fix the first two elements at positions 0 and 1 and permute the remaining elements in descending order. Similarly, if the input sequence has length 8, then we fix the first three elements at positions 0, 1, and 2 and permute the remaining elements in descending order.

Case 2: When the length of the input sequence is greater than 5.

If the length of the input sequence is greater than 5, then we need to modify the transformation pattern slightly. Specifically, instead of fixing the first element at position 0 and permuting the remaining elements in descending order, we fix the first k elements at positions 0 through kâˆ’1 and permute the remaining elements in descending order. Here, k is the smallest integer such that k > 5 and k divides the length of the input sequence evenly.

For example, suppose the input sequence has length 12. Then, k = 6 since 6 is the smallest integer greater than 5 that divides 12 evenly. Therefore, we fix the first six elements at positions 0 through 5 and permute the remaining six elements in descending order. This results in the following transformation pattern:Fix the first six elements at positions 0 through 5.Permute the remaining six elements in descending order.

Similarly, if the input sequence has length 24, then k = 8 since 8 is the smallest integer greater than 5 that divides 24 evenly. Therefore, we fix the first eight elements at positions 0 through 7 and permute the remaining 16 elements in descending order. This results in the following transformation pattern:Fix the first eight elements at positions 0 through 7.Permute the remaining 16 elements in descending order.

Note that if the input sequence does not have an even number of elements, then we cannot find an integer k that satisfies the above condition. In this case, we need to apply the transformation pattern discussed in Section 4.2.2.1.

## 4.3. Implementation Details

In this section, we provide implementation details for our proposed algorithm. We use Python programming language to implement the algorithm. Our implementation consists of two main functions: `transform` and `inverse_transform`. The `transform` function takes an input sequence and applies the transformation pattern discussed in Section 4.2.2.1. The `inverse_transform` function takes an output sequence and applies the inverse transformation pattern discussed in Section 4.2.2.2.

### 4.3.1. Function transform(seq)

The `transform` function takes an input sequence `seq` and applies the transformation pattern discussed in Section 4.2.2.1. It returns the transformed sequence.

Algorithm 4.1 shows the pseudocode for the `transform` function.

### Algorithm 4.1. Pseudocode for transform(seq).
