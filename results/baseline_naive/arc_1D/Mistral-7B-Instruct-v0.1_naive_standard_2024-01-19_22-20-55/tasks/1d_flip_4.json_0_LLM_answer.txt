LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'h', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input sequence. In Example_1, the rule is that if there are two consecutive elements in the input sequence, they should be replaced with their concatenation. In Example_2, the rule is that if there are three or more consecutive elements in the input sequence, they should be replaced with their concatenation. In Example_3, the rule is that if there are two consecutive elements in the input sequence, and one of them is 'd', then they should be replaced with their concatenation. In Test case, the rule is that if there are two consecutive elements in the input sequence, and one of them is 'h', then they should be replaced with their concatenation.

Note that the rules for each example can be expressed as regular expressions. For example, the rule for Example_1 can be expressed as (?<=a)(?=a)(\w+), which matches any pair of consecutive elements where the first element is 'a'. Similarly, the rule for Example_2 can be expressed as (?<=\w{3})(\w+), which matches any group of four or more consecutive elements. The rule for Example_3 can be expressed as (?<=a)(?=d)\w+, which matches any pair of consecutive elements where the second element is 'd'. And the rule for Test case can be expressed as (?<=\w)(?=\w{2}h)\w+, which matches any pair of consecutive elements where the second element is 'h' and the first element is not 'h'.
