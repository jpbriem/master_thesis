LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'g', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'g', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'g', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g']

The output of each example is a permutation of the input sequence, where the first element is always 'a' and the last element is always 'g'. The middle elements can be any combination of 'a' and 'c'.

### 4.2.2.2.3. Transformation Patterns

In order to understand the transformation patterns in this problem, we need to analyze the possible combinations of the two characters in the input sequence. There are four possible cases: (1) all elements are 'a'; (2) all elements are 'c'; (3) there are two 'a's and one 'c'; and (4) there are three 'a's and no 'c'. We will use these cases as our basis for understanding the transformation patterns.

Case 1: All elements are 'a'. In this case, the output sequence will always be 'aa...aa', followed by 'g'. This means that the transformation function will simply repeat the first character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. For example, if the input sequence is 'aaaaaa', the output sequence will be 'aaaaaaaaaa...aa', followed by 'g'.

Case 2: All elements are 'c'. In this case, the output sequence will always be 'cc...cc', followed by 'g'. This means that the transformation function will simply repeat the second character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. For example, if the input sequence is 'cccccc', the output sequence will be 'cccccc...cc', followed by 'g'.

Case 3: There are two 'a's and one 'c'. In this case, the output sequence will always start with 'a', followed by either 'a' or 'c', depending on whether there is an even number or odd number of 'a's in the input sequence. If there is an even number of 'a's, the output sequence will end with 'g'. If there is an odd number of 'a's, the output sequence will end with 'c'. For example, if the input sequence is 'acca', the output sequence will be 'a...a', followed by 'c', followed by 'a...a', followed by 'g'.

Case 4: There are three 'a's and no 'c'. In this case, the output sequence will always start with 'a', followed by either 'a' or 'c', depending on whether there is an even number or odd number of 'a's in the input sequence. If there is an even number of 'a's, the output sequence will end with 'g'. If there is an odd number of 'a's, the output sequence will end with 'c'. For example, if the input sequence is 'aaaa', the output sequence will be 'a...a', followed by 'c', followed by 'a...a', followed by 'g'.

Using these cases as our basis, we can now understand how the transformation function works. Given an input sequence, the function will first check which case applies. If Case 1 applies (all elements are 'a'), the function will simply repeat the first character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. If Case 2 applies (all elements are 'c'), the function will simply repeat the second character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. If Case 3 applies (two 'a's and one 'c'), the function will first check whether there is an even number or odd number of 'a's in the input sequence. If there is an even number of 'a's, the function will repeat the first character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. If there is an odd number of 'a's, the function will repeat the second character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. If Case 4 applies (three 'a's and no 'c'), the function will first check whether there is an even number or odd number of 'a's in the input sequence. If there is an even number of 'a's, the function will repeat the first character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then append 'g'. If there is an odd number of 'a's, the function will repeat the second character in the input sequence until it reaches the desired length, and then

Solution:
['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'g']
