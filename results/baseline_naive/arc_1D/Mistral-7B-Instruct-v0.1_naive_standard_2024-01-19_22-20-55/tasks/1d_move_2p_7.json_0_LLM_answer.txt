LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['e', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current element in the input sequence is 'a', then it should be replaced with itself (i.e., remain unchanged). Otherwise, if the current element is not 'a', then it should be replaced with 'a'.
2. After replacing all elements in the input sequence, we need to remove any consecutive occurrences of 'a' from the beginning or end of the sequence. Specifically, we start at index 0 and iterate over the entire sequence. For each index i, if the current element is 'a' and there is an 'a' before it, we replace the pair ('a', 'a') with just 'a'. Similarly, if the current element is 'a' and there is an 'a' after it, we replace the pair ('a', 'a') with just 'a'. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the sequence.

We can implement this transformation using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the entire sequence, while the inner loop checks for consecutive occurrences of 'a' at each position. Here's one possible implementation:
```python
def transform(seq):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(seq)):
        curr = seq[i]
        if curr == 'a':
            # Replace 'a' with itself
            result.append(curr)
        else:
            # Replace non-'a' with 'a'
            result.append('a')
    # Remove consecutive 'a' from beginning/end
    for j in range(len(result)-1):
        if result[j] == 'a' and result[j+1] == 'a':
            result.pop(j)
    return result
```
This function takes a list `seq` as input and returns the transformed sequence as output. It first initializes an empty list `result`, which will store the transformed sequence. Then it iterates over the entire sequence using a `for` loop. At each iteration, it checks whether the current element is 'a' or not using an `if` statement. If the current element is 'a', it simply appends itself to the `result` list. Otherwise, it replaces the current element with 'a' and appends it to the `result` list.

After iterating over the entire sequence, the function needs to remove any consecutive occurrences of 'a' from the beginning or end of the sequence. To do this, it uses another `for` loop that starts at index 1 and ends at the second-to-last index of the `result` list. At each iteration, it checks whether the current element is 'a' and its next element is also 'a'. If so, it removes the current element from the `result` list using the `pop()` method. This continues until the end of the `result` list is reached.

Finally, the function returns the transformed `result` list.
