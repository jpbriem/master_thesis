LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If there exists an element in the input sequence that appears more than once, replace all occurrences of this element with its first appearance.
2. Otherwise, keep the original order of elements in the input sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence contains two elements 'a' and 'c'. Since 'a' appears twice, we replace both occurrences of 'a' with its first appearance. Similarly, since 'c' appears three times, we replace all occurrences of 'c' with its first appearance. As a result, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a'].

In Example_2, the input sequence contains two elements 'a' and 'i'. Since 'a' appears twice, we replace both occurrences of 'a' with its first appearance. However, since 'i' does not appear more than once, we keep it in the original order. As a result, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a'].

Similarly, in Example_3, the input sequence contains two elements 'i' and 'a'. Since 'i' appears twice, we replace both occurrences of 'i' with its first appearance. However, since 'a' does not appear more than once, we keep it in the original order. As a result, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a'].

Finally, in Test case, the input sequence contains two elements 'd' and 'a'. Since 'd' appears five times, we replace all occurrences of 'd' with its first appearance. However, since 'a' does not appear more than once, we keep it in the original order. As a result, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'].

Solution:
['a', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a']
