LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence, which maps each element in the input sequence to an element in the output sequence according to some rule. In this case, the rule is that if the current element is 'a' then it should be mapped to 'a', otherwise it should be mapped to 'b'. If there are two consecutive elements 'a', they should be replaced with 'j'. If there are three consecutive elements 'a', they should be replaced with 'f'. If there are four consecutive elements 'a', they should be replaced with 'a'.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach where we process the input sequence one element at a time and keep track of the current state of the window. We can represent the current state of the window as a tuple (count\_a, count\_b, count\_j, count\_f), where count\_a represents the number of consecutive 'a's, count\_b represents the number of consecutive 'b's, count\_j represents the number of consecutive 'j's, and count\_f represents the number of consecutive 'f's. We can update the current state of the window whenever we encounter a new element in the input sequence.

We can also define a function to apply the transformation rule to the current state of the window and return the corresponding element in the output sequence. This function will take into account the current state of the window and replace any elements accordingly.

Finally, we can iterate over the input sequence using a sliding window approach and apply the transformation rule to each element in the input sequence to obtain the corresponding element in the output sequence.

Here's the Python code for solving the problem using the above approach:
```python
def transform(input_seq):
    # Initialize the current state of the window
    count_a = 0
    count_b = 0
    count_j = 0
    count_f = 0
    
    # Iterate over the input sequence using a sliding window approach
    for i in range(len(input_seq)):
        # Update the current state of the window
        if input_seq[i] == 'a':
            count_a += 1
        elif input_seq[i] == 'b':
            count_b += 1
        elif input_seq[i] == 'j':
            count_j += 1
        elif input_seq[i] == 'f':
            count_f += 1
        
        # Apply the transformation rule to the current state of the window
        if count_a >= 4:
            output_elem = 'a'
        elif count_a >= 3:
            output_elem = 'f'
        elif count_a >= 2:
            output_elem = 'j'
        else:
            output_elem = input_seq[i]
        
        yield output_elem
```
This code defines a function `transform` that takes an input sequence as input and returns the corresponding output sequence. The function uses a sliding window approach to process the input sequence one element at a time and applies the transformation rule to each element in the input sequence to obtain the corresponding element in the output sequence. The function returns the output sequence as a generator object.
