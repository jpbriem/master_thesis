LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'f', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'f', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'f', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a transformation function to the input sequence, which can be expressed as follows:

1. For each element in the input sequence, if it is equal to 'a', then replace it with itself; otherwise, replace it with the next occurrence of 'a' in the sequence.
2. If there are no more occurrences of 'a' in the sequence, replace all elements with themselves.

For example, for Example_1, the first occurrence of 'a' is replaced with itself (resulting in 'a'), while the second occurrence of 'a' replaces the first occurrence of 'd' (resulting in 'a'). This process continues until all occurrences of 'a' have been replaced or exhausted. At this point, all remaining elements are replaced with themselves.

Similarly, for Example_2, the first occurrence of 'a' is replaced with itself, while the second occurrence of 'a' replaces the first occurrence of 'g' (resulting in 'a'). This process continues until all occurrences of 'a' have been replaced or exhausted. At this point, all remaining elements are replaced with themselves.

Finally, for Example_3, the first occurrence of 'a' is replaced with itself, while the second occurrence of 'a' replaces the first occurrence of 'b' (resulting in 'a'). This process continues until all occurrences of 'a' have been replaced or exhausted. At this point, all remaining elements are replaced with themselves.

In Test case, since there are no occurrences of 'a' in the input sequence, all elements are replaced with themselves.
