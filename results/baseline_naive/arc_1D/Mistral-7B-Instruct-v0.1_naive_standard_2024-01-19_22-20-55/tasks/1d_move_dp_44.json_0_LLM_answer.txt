LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'j']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'j']

Example_2:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'j', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'j', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'j']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'j']

Test case:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'j', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'j']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input sequence, where the first letter is always placed at the end of the sequence, and the remaining letters are arranged in decreasing order of frequency. In other words, if there are two or more occurrences of a letter, they should be adjacent to each other in the output sequence. If there are no repeated letters, then the output sequence should be sorted in alphabetical order.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence contains three occurrences of 'h' and one occurrence of 'a'. After sorting them in descending order of frequency, we get [h, h, h]. Then, since 'a' appears only once, it is placed after the three 'h's. Finally, the last letter 'j' is added to the end of the sequence. Therefore, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'j'].

Similarly, in Example_2, the input sequence contains three occurrences of 'd' and one occurrence of 'a' and 'j'. After sorting them in descending order of frequency, we get [d, d, d]. Then, since 'a' appears twice, it is placed between the three 'd's. Finally, the last letter 'j' is added to the end of the sequence. Therefore, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'j', 'a'].

In Test case, the input sequence contains three occurrences of 'f' and one occurrence of 'a' and 'j'. After sorting them in descending order of frequency, we get [f, f, f]. Then, since 'a' appears twice, it is placed between the three 'f's. Finally, the last letter 'j' is added to the end of the sequence. Therefore, the output sequence is ['a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'j'].
