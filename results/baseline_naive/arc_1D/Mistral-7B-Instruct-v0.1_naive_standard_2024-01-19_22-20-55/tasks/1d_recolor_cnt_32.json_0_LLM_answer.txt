LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'g']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'c']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1']

The output of the function should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of occurrences of its corresponding character in the input string. For example, if the input is "aaabbbcc", then the output will be [2, 2, 1, 1, 1].

You may assume that the input string contains only lowercase letters.

Constraints:
1 <= len(s) <= 10^5
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Examples:
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]

Input: s = "gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
