LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a']

The output of each example is obtained by applying a simple rule to the input sequence, which can be described as follows:

1. If the current element in the input sequence is 'a', then it should be replaced with itself (no change).
2. Otherwise, if the current element in the input sequence is not 'a', then it should be replaced with its next occurrence in the input sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first two elements are 'h', so they are replaced with their next occurrence 'a'. Similarly, in Example_2, the first three elements are 'd', so they are replaced with their next occurrence 'a'. In Example_3, the first three elements are 'i', so they are replaced with themselves. Finally, in Test case, the first three elements are 'f', so they are replaced with their next occurrence 'a'.

Your task is to implement this transformation pattern using Python code. You may assume that the input sequence will always contain at least one 'a' character.

Solution:
['a', 'a', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a']
