LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['f', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'g', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_2:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'g', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'g', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Example_3:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']

Test case:
input: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a']

LLM answer:

output: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'c', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a']

The output of the function should be a list containing only one element, which is the transformed string.

Constraints:
1 <= len(s) <= 10^5
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Examples:
Input: s = "gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
