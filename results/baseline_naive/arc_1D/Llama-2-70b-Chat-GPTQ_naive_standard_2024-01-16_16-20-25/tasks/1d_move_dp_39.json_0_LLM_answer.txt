LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: ['.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', 'c', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'c', '.']

Example_2:
input: ['b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'c', '.', '.', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', '.', '.', '.']

Example_3:
input: ['f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'c', '.']
output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'f', 'c', '.']

Test case:
input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', 'c', '.']

LLM answer:

output: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', '.', '.']

The first line of each pair is the input, and the second line is the expected output.
Notice that in all three examples, the last character of the input is a period (.) followed by the last character of the output. This is not a coincidence; it is a fundamental property of the transformation.
In general, if we call the last character of the input x, then the last character of the output will be x or., whichever comes later in the alphabet.
For example, if the last character of the input is b, then the last character of the output will be c (or., if c comes before b in the alphabet). If the last character of the input is f, then the last character of the output will be f (or., if f comes before the period in the alphabet).
This rule applies to all characters in the input, not just the last one. In fact, the entire transformation can be described as follows:
For each character x in the input, the corresponding character y in the output is such that either y = x or y =., whichever comes later in the alphabet than x.
Using this rule, you can work out the output for any input string. For example, to determine the output for the test case input: ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.', 'c', '.']
you can apply the rule like this:
. ->.
. ->.
. ->.
. ->.
. ->.
b ->.
b -> b
b -> b
. -> c
. ->.
c ->.
The resulting output is ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', '.', '.']
As promised, here's an explanation of why this transformation works:
Consider any two characters x and y in the input, where x comes before y. We want to know what happens to them in the output.
If x and y are different, then they will have different outputs, say z and w, respectively. Since x comes before y in the input, z will come before w in the output.
Now suppose x = y. Then z = w, because both x and y map to the same character in the output.
Therefore, the relative order of x and y in the input determines the relative order of z and w in the output.
Since every character in the input has a unique position, it maps to a unique character in the output, which means that no two characters in the output will have the same position.
So, the transformation preserves the relative order of the characters in the input while mapping each character to a new position in the output.
This reasoning shows that the transformation is indeed a bijection (both one-to-one and onto), which means that it is invertible.
To summarize, we have shown that the given transformation is both surjective (onto) and injective (one-to-one), which implies that it is bijective. Therefore, it has an inverse function that maps each output character back to its original position in the input.
