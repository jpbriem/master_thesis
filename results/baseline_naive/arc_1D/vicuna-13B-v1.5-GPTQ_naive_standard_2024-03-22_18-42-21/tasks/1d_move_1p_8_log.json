returns the sorted list.\n\nThe program uses a hash table to keep track of the frequency of characters in the input list.\n\nThe program then sorts the input list based on the frequency of characters and returns the sorted list.\n\nThe program does not return the original input list.\n\nThe program does not return an empty list.\n\nThe program does not return a list with the same elements as the
