Explanation:
The program takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list of strings.

The program first sorts the input list based on the frequency of characters.

Then it returns the sorted list by removing all the characters that are not unique in the sorted list.

The program uses two lists to store the characters and their frequency.

The first list is used to store the characters and the second list is used to store the frequency of each character.

The program then sorts the characters based on the frequency of characters and returns the sorted list by removing all the characters that are not unique in the sorted list.

The program uses a hash table to store the frequency of each character.
