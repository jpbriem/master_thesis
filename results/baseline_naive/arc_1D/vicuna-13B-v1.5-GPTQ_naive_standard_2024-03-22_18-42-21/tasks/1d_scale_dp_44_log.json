returns a new list of strings.\n\nThe program first sorts the input list based on the frequency of characters.\n\nThen it returns the sorted list by removing all the characters that are not unique in the sorted list.\n\nThe program uses two lists to store the characters and their frequency.\n\nThe first list is used to store the characters and the second list is used to store the frequency of each character.\n\nThe program then sorts the characters based on the frequency of characters and returns the sorted list by removing all the characters that are not unique in the sorted list.\n\nThe program uses a hash table to store the frequency of each character.\n\nThe program then sorts the characters based on the frequency of characters and returns the sorted list by removing all the characters that are not unique in the sorted list.\n\nThe program uses a hash table to store the frequency of each character.\n\nThe program then sorts the characters based on the frequency of
