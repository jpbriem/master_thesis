Explanation:
The program takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list of strings.

The program first sorts the input list based on the frequency of characters.

Then it iterates through the sorted list and checks if the current character is the most frequent character in the list. If it is, it appends the current character to the output list.

Finally, the program returns the sorted output list.

Note:

* The input list is a list of strings.
* The program should return a new list of strings.
* The characters in the strings are case-sensitive.
* The program should work for strings of length at least 1.
* The program should not use any additional data structures.
* The program should not use any additional functions.
