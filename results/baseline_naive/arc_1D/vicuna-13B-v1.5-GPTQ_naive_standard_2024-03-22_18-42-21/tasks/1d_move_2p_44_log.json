If it is, it appends the current character to the output list.\n\nFinally, the program returns the sorted output list.\n\nNote:\n\n* The input list is a list of strings.\n* The program should return a new list of strings.\n* The characters in the strings are case-sensitive.\n* The program should work for strings of length at least 1.\n* The program should not use any additional data structures.\n*
