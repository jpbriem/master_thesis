LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'e', '.', 'e'], ['a', '.', 'a', '.'], ['h', '.', '.', '.']]
output: [['.', '.', '.', '.'], ['e', 'e', '.', '.'], ['a', 'a', '.', '.'], ['h', '.', '.', '.']]

Example_2:
input: [['.', '.', 'i', '.'], ['.', 'a', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.'], ['b', '.', '.', '.']]
output: [['i', '.', '.', '.'], ['a', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.'], ['b', '.', '.', '.']]

Example_3:
input: [['.', 'c', 'c', '.'], ['h', 'h', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.']]
output: [['c', 'c', '.', '.'], ['h', 'h', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.']]

Test case:
input: [['e', '.', '.', 'e'], ['g', 'g', '.', 'g'], ['.', 'b', '.', '.'], ['c', 'c', 'c', '.']]
