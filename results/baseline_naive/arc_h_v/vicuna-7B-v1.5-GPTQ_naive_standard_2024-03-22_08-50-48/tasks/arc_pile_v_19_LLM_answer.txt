Explanation:
We can use the following approach to solve this problem:

1. Sort the input list in non-decreasing order of the second element (the key) of each sublist.
2. For each sublist, find the index of the first element (the value) that is greater than the second element of the sublist.
3. Replace the first element of the sublist with the second element of the sublist.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each sublist until all sublists have the same length.
5. Return the sorted list of sublists.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) for each sublist, where n is the length of the input list.

To optimize the solution, we can use the following approach:

1. Sort the input list in non-decreasing order of the second element (the key) of each sublist.
2. For each sublist, find the index of the first element (the value) that is greater than the second element of the sublist.
3. Replace the first element of the sublist with the second element of the sublist.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each sublist until all sublists have the same length.
5. Return the sorted list of sublists.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) for each sublist, where n is the length of the input list.
