Sample Outputs:
output: [[7, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 0, 3, 0]]

Explanation:
In the first two examples, the input is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the number of balls of each color that should be placed in the first row of the sack. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the number of balls of each color that should be placed in the first row of the sack after the first row has been filled. The first row is filled with the balls of the color that has the least number of balls in the input list.

In the third example, the input is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the number of balls of each color that should be placed in the first row of the sack. The output is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the number of balls of each color that should be placed in the first row of the sack after the first row has been filled. The first row is filled with the balls of the color that has the least number of balls in the input list.</s>
