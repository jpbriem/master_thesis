I'm not sure what you mean by \"the number of times that a cell has been visited\". Do you want to count how many cells have value `3`, or do you just need an array with all values set to zero except those where there was originally a three (and then replace them)? Or something else entirely? Please clarify. Also please add some more examples and their corresponding outputs so we can see if our solutions work on other inputs as well. Thanks! :)\n\n## Answer (4)\n\n# Python 3, ~~89~~ 76 bytes\n\n- -13 thanks to @ovs\n\n```\nlambda m:[[max(x*y//3for x in r[:i]+r[i+1:])or y%3<1for i,y in enumerate(r)]for r in m]\n```\n\nTry it online!\n\nTakes input as list of lists of integers. Outputs same format.\n\nThe idea here is simple enough; each element should be replaced with either itself or its maximum neighbouring nonzero element modulo 3. The only trickiness comes from handling edge cases correctly without too much code bloat. We use integer division instead of floor division because this allows us to handle both edges at once using one condition rather than two separate conditions. This also means we don't actually care about whether elements are positive or negative since they will always round down anyway. Finally, note that when checking neighbours we must check *all* neighbours including diagonals but exclude ourselves. For example, given \\$a_{ij}\\$, we would consider \\$a_{(i\\pm1)(j\\pm1)}\\$. However, we cannot simply iterate over these indices directly due to wrapping around the ends of rows/columns. Instead, we first take slices excluding the current row/column before concatenating back together again. In python slice notation, taking everything up until index \\$n\\$ inclusive is written like `[:n+1]`. So, e.g., `r[:i]+r[i+1:]` gives every item in row `r` apart from position `i`. Note that this works even though `i` may equal `len(r)-1` which might otherwise cause problems. That's because `r[i+1:]` returns nothing in such situations meaning no extra items get added onto the end. Similarly, `r[-1::-1][:-i-1]+r[i:]` does the equivalent thing for columns.\n\nComment: You could save quite a few characters by replacing `math.floor()` with integer division. And maybe another byte by removing the space after `in`.\n\nComment: Good point re integer division. Not sure why I didn't think of that... As for spaces, yes probably worth doing although personally I prefer having consistent spacing throughout my answers unless absolutely necessary. It makes things easier to read imo. But yeah fair enough if others disagree :P\n\nComment: Oh wait never mind, turns out integer division doesn't help me very much after all lol. Still saves a couple chars tho\n\nComment: Ahh right, forgot about the sign issue. Maybe you could still make good use of it somewhere else.\n\nComment: Yeah true. Will keep looking into it later today perhaps\n\nComment: Actually now that I look closer, seems like you were talking about dividing by 3 specifically. Hmm interesting thought. Might give that a try soonish\n\nComment: Yep exactly. Integer divison by constant factors often helps golfers ;-)\n\nComment: Well done! Now let's hope OP accepts this answer haha\n\nComment: Lol indeed. Although tbh I wouldn't blame him if he accepted yours instead considering his question title says javascript explicitly XD\n\nComment: True, but mine isn't really JS specific anymore anyways. Just uses ES6 syntax. Should run fine anywhere modern JavaScript runs afaik.\n\nComment: Fair enough. Guess we shall find out eventually who gets chosen ^^\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/118111/discussion-between-caird-coinheringaahing-and-ajax).\n\nComment: [-13 bytes](https://tio.run/##bZHBboMwDIXv@RUJQkKFYqEGWVNlIuCpSzLfOeAQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ"
