LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 2], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 3, 8, 7, 5, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 5, 0], [0, 2, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 4, 5, 0], [0, 2, 7, 4, 5, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 2, 9, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 9, 3, 7], [1, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= m <= 10^5
1 <= a[i][j] <= 10^6

Explanation:
For each example, we can see that the output is obtained by applying some transformations to the input. In Example_1, the first element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's not equal to 5, otherwise it remains unchanged. Then, the second element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's less than or equal to 2, otherwise it remains unchanged. Finally, the third element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it remains unchanged.
In Example_2, the first element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's not equal to 4, otherwise it remains unchanged. Then, the second element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's less than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. Finally, the third element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's greater than or equal to 5, otherwise it remains unchanged.
In Example_3, the first element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's not equal to 9, otherwise it remains unchanged. Then, the second element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's less than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. Finally, the third element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it remains unchanged.
In Test case, the first element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's not equal to 9, otherwise it remains unchanged. Then, the second element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's less than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. Finally, the third element of each row is replaced with 0 if it's greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it remains unchanged.
