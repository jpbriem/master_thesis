LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7], [6, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7], [6, 0, 8, 7]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 8, 9, 0, 4], [0, 8, 9, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 8, 9, 0, 4], [0, 8, 9, 6, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0], [4, 0, 0, 5], [4, 0, 6, 5], [0, 0, 6, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0], [4, 0, 6, 5], [4, 0, 6, 5]]

Test case:
input: [[4, 0, 7, 9, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 8], [4, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 8], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[4, 0, 7, 9, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 8], [4, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 8], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= m <= 10^5
1 <= a[i][j] <= 10^9

Explanation:
For each row in the input matrix A, we need to perform the following operations:
1. If there is an element in the current row that is greater than or equal to 10^m, we replace it with 10^m - 1 (which is less than or equal to 10^m). This ensures that all elements in the current row are less than or equal to 10^m.
2. We then iterate through all the rows above the current row and check if any of them have an element that is less than or equal to the current element in the current row. If such an element exists, we swap the current element with the corresponding element in the row above it.
3. Finally, we add 1 to the current element in the current row.

We repeat these operations for all rows in the input matrix A.

Note that we only need to consider the rows above the current row because any element below the current row can only be replaced by an element from the row above it.

Solution:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 9, 0], [4, 0, 7, 9, 8], [4, 6, 7, 9, 8]]
