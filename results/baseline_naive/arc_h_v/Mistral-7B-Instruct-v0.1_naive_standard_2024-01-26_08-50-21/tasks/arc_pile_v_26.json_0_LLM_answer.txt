LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [6, 2, 0, 9, 8, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 9, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 6, 0], [2, 0, 3, 0, 6, 8], [2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 9, 6, 8], [2, 0, 3, 9, 6, 8], [2, 0, 3, 9, 6, 8]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 9], [3, 0, 5, 0, 0], [3, 8, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [3, 8, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 8, 5, 1, 0], [3, 8, 5, 1, 9]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 5, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 6, 0, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 6, 0, 0]]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array. In Example_1, the first element of the input array is replaced by 0, the second element is replaced by 9, the third element is replaced by 6, the fourth element is replaced by 0, the fifth element is replaced by 8, and the sixth element is replaced by 0. In Example_2, the first element of the input array is replaced by 0, the second element is replaced by 9, the third element is replaced by 6, the fourth element is replaced by 0, the fifth element is replaced by 8, and the sixth element is replaced by 0. In Example_3, the first element of the input array is replaced by 1, the second element is replaced by 0, the third element is replaced by 0, the fourth element is replaced by 0, and the fifth element is replaced by 9. In Test case, the first element of the input array is replaced by 0, the second element is replaced by 0, the third element is replaced by 9, the fourth element is replaced by 0, and the fifth element is replaced by 0.

Note that in all cases, the order of elements in the input array does not affect the output. Also note that the output may contain duplicate elements.

Solution:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 5, 0], [9, 3, 6, 5, 1]]
