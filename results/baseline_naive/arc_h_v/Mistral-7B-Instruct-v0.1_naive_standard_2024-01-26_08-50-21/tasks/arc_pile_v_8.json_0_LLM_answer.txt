LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 6, 4, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 6], [1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [1, 7, 3, 8, 0, 0], [1, 7, 3, 8, 0, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0], [0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 1], [0, 0, 3, 7, 5, 1]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3], [7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 1, 6, 8, 0], [0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 3]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 1, 6, 8, 0], [0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 3]]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input array. In Example_1, the first element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 0. The second element of the input array is also 0, so it remains in the output array at position 1. The third element of the input array is 2, which is greater than the first two elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The fourth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 3. The fifth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 4. The sixth element of the input array is 4, which is greater than the first five elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The seventh element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 5. The eighth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 6. The ninth element of the input array is 6, which is greater than the first eight elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The tenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 7. The eleventh element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 8. The twelfth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 9. The thirteenth element of the input array is 4, which is greater than the first eleven elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The fourteenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 10. The fifteenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 11. The sixteenth element of the input array is 9, which is greater than the first fifteen elements, so it moves to the end of the output array.

In Example_2, the first element of the input array is 1, so it remains in the output array at position 0. The second element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 1. The third element of the input array is 3, which is greater than the first two elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The fourth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 3. The fifth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 4. The sixth element of the input array is 8, which is greater than the first five elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The seventh element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 5. The eighth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 6. The ninth element of the input array is 3, which is greater than the first eight elements, so it moves to the end of the output array. The tenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 7. The eleventh element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 8. The twelfth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 9. The thirteenth element of the input array is 8, so it moves to the end of the output array. The fourteenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 10. The fifteenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 11. The sixteenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 12. The seventeenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 13. The eighteenth element of the input array is 0, so it remains in the output array at position 14. The nineteenth element of the
