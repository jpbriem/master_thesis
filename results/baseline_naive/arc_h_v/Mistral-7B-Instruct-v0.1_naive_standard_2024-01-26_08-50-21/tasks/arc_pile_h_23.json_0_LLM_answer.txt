LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1]]
output: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 3, 3, 3], [9, 0, 0, 9], [5, 0, 5, 5], [2, 2, 2, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 3, 3, 3], [9, 0, 0, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5], [2, 2, 2, 0]]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= m <= 10^5
1 <= a[i][j] <= 10^6

Explanation:
For each element in the output array, we need to find its corresponding element in the input array. If the current element is 0, then it should be replaced with 0 in the output array. Otherwise, if the current element is not 0, we need to count how many times this number appears in the input array. Then we can replace this number with the count of itself in the output array.

For example, for the first element in the input array, which is 0, we just need to replace it with 0 in the output array. For the second element in the input array, which is 3, we need to count how many times 3 appears in the input array. We can see that 3 appears twice in the input array, so we replace 3 with 2 in the output array. Similarly, for the third element in the input array, which is also 3, we replace it with 2 in the output array. Finally, for the fourth element in the input array, which is 3, we replace it with 2 in the output array as well. Therefore, the final output array is [0, 3, 3, 3].

Solution:
[[3, 3, 3, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0]]
