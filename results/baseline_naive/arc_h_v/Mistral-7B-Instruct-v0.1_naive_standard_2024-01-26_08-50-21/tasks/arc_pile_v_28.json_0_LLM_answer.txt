LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 6, 1, 8], [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8], [0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 3, 1, 4], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 3, 1, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[7, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5], [7, 1, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 1, 0, 0], [7, 1, 0, 5], [7, 1, 0, 5]]

Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4], [8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4], [8, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4], [8, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0]]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input sequence. In Example_1, the first element of the input sequence is removed and the remaining elements are shifted to the left by one position. In Example_2, the second element of the input sequence is removed and the remaining elements are shifted to the right by one position. In Example_3, the third element of the input sequence is removed and the remaining elements are shifted to the right by two positions. In Test case, the fifth element of the input sequence is removed and the remaining elements are shifted to the right by three positions.

Note that in all cases, the number of elements removed from the input sequence is equal to the index of the removed element plus one (i.e., if the index of the removed element is k, then k+1 elements are removed). Also note that the resulting sequences have the same length as the original sequences.

Solution:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [8, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4], [8, 7, 3, 5, 6, 4]]
