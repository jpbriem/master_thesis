LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 8, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 7, 2, 6, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 0], [8, 0, 1, 4, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]

The output of each example is a permutation of the input list. In Example_1, the first element of the input list is replaced by 0, the second element is replaced by 0, the third element is replaced by 0, the fourth element is replaced by 0, the fifth element is replaced by 0, and the sixth element is replaced by 0. Then, the elements in the input list are reordered to form the output list. Similarly, in Example_2, the first two elements of the input list are replaced by 0, the third element is replaced by 0, the fourth element is replaced by 4, the fifth element is replaced by 0, and the sixth element is replaced by 0. Then, the elements in the input list are reordered to form the output list. In Example_3, the first two elements of the input list are replaced by 0, the third element is replaced by 5, the fourth element is replaced by 0, the fifth element is replaced by 0, and the sixth element is replaced by 0. Then, the elements in the input list are reordered to form the output list.

In Test case, the first two elements of the input list are replaced by 0, the third element is replaced by 9, the fourth element is replaced by 5, the fifth element is replaced by 0, and the sixth element is replaced by 8. Then, the elements in the input list are reordered to form the output list.

Solution:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8], [3, 9, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 9, 4, 5, 7, 8]]
