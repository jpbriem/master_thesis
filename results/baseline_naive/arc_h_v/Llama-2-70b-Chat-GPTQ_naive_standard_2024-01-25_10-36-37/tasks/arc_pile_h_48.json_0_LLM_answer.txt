LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 1, 1], [9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 1, 1, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 3], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]

LLM answer:

output: [[7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0]]

The goal is to transform the input matrix into the output matrix by applying a series of row operations. Each row operation consists of a single elementary operation chosen from the set {add, multiply} applied to two rows at a time. The order in which the row operations are performed matters, as some operations may undo or modify previous ones. Your task is to find a sequence of row operations that can transform the input matrix into the output matrix.

Note:

* The input and output matrices have the same number of rows and columns.
* Each element in the input and output matrices is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
* You can assume that the input matrix has no zero rows, i.e., each row has at least one non-zero element.
* The same row operation cannot be applied twice in a row (i.e., you cannot apply the same operation to the same pair of rows more than once).
* If there are multiple ways to achieve the transformation, you should return the shortest sequence of row operations.

Solution:
[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]
