LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 4], [3, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6]]
output: [[4, 4, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [1, 0, 1, 1]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2]]

LLM answer:

output: [[6, 6, 5, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2]]

Explanation:
The given input is transformed into a new array by applying the following rules:

* If any element in the input array is zero, it remains unchanged.
* Otherwise, if the number of elements greater than or equal to 3 in the current row is odd, add 1 to all elements in that row.
* Otherwise, if the number of elements greater than or equal to 3 in the current column is odd, subtract 1 from all elements in that column.

For example, in Example_1, the first row has two elements greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., 3 and 6), so both elements are increased by 1. Similarly, in Example_2, the second row has three elements greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., 3, 3, and 0), so all elements in that row are increased by 1. In Example_3, the third row has four elements greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., 3, 3, 3, and 0), so all elements in that row are increased by 1.

In Test case, the input array contains two elements greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., 6 and 1), so both elements are increased by 1.
