LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5]]
output: [[6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 8, 8, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[7, 7, 0, 7], [2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]

Explanation:
The given transformation pattern can be applied to any input matrix by repeatedly applying the following rules:

1. If the current cell is zero, leave it unchanged.
2. Otherwise, if the current cell is greater than or equal to 5, replace it with a random value between 0 and 6 (inclusive).
3. Otherwise, if the current cell is less than 5, replace it with a random value between 0 and 7 (inclusive).

For example, in Example_1, the first input matrix contains two cells that are greater than or equal to 5 (cells at position [0, 6] and [0, 8]), so these cells are replaced with random values between 0 and 6 (respectively). Similarly, in Example_2, the second input matrix contains one cell that is less than 5 (cell at position [2, 0]), so this cell is replaced with a random value between 0 and 7 (inclusive). In Example_3, the fifth input matrix contains three cells that are greater than or equal to 5 (cells at position [0, 6], [0, 8], and [0, 5]) and two cells that are less than 5 (cells at position [0, 0] and [0, 7]), so these cells are replaced with random values between 0 and 6 (respectively) and random values between 0 and 7 (respectively).

In Test case, the input matrix contains four cells that are greater than or equal to 5 (cells at position [0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 7], and [3, 7]) and one cell that is less than 5 (cell at position [0, 0]), so this cell is replaced with a random value between 0 and 6 (inclusive).
