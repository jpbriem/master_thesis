LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['a', 'a', 'a', 'h'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['c', 'a', 'c', 'a'], ['a', 'j', 'j', 'j']]
output: [['h', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['c', 'c', 'a', 'a'], ['j', 'j', 'j', 'a']]

Example_2:
input: [['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['e', 'e', 'a', 'e'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['e', 'e', 'e', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Example_3:
input: [['a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['j', 'a', 'j', 'j', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'e']]
output: [['i', 'i', 'i', 'a', 'a'], ['c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a'], ['e', 'e', 'e', 'a', 'a']]

Test case:
input: [['a', 'a', 'h', 'a', 'h'], ['e', 'a', 'e', 'e', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'c'], ['f', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'f'], ['g', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a']]
