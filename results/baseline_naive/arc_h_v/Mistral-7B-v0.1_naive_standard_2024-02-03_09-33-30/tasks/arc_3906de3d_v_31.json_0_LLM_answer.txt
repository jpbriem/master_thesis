## Answer (4)

# Python 3, ~~78~~ 69 bytes

```
lambda x:[max(x[i][j]for i in range(len(x)))if j<len(x)-1else max(x[i][j+1]for i in range(len(x)))]for j in range(len(x[0]))]
```

Try it online!

Comment: `range(len(x))` can be replaced with `range(n)`.

Comment: @KevinCruijssen Thanks for the tip! I've updated my answer accordingly.
