LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 4]]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a two-dimensional array of integers. Each element in the array represents a binary decision (0 or 1) whether a particular feature is present or not. We need to transform this array into a one-dimensional array where each element represents the sum of all the features that are present.

To achieve this, we can use a simple algorithm based on the following steps:

Step 1: Initialize an empty array of size n+1, where n is the number of elements in the input array.

Step 2: Iterate over each element in the input array and for each element, iterate over all the features that are present in that element. For each feature, add the value of that feature to the corresponding position in the output array.

Step 3: Return the transformed array.

In more detail, the algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize an empty array of size n+1, where n is the number of elements in the input array. This array will be filled with values as we iterate over the input array.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array. For each element, iterate over all the features that are present in that element. For each feature, add the value of that feature to the corresponding position in the output array.
3. Return the transformed array.

For example, consider the input array:
```
[
   [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
   [0, 0, 2, 2, 2],
   [0, 7, 7, 0, 0],
   [0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
   [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
]
```
We can represent this array as a set of binary decisions, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether a particular feature is present or not. For example, the first element `[0, 0, 5, 0, 5]` can be represented as the set `{feature 1: 0, feature 2: 0, feature 3: 1, feature 4: 1}`.

Now, let's apply the transformation function to this input array. We will initialize an empty array of size 6 (since there are 6 elements in the input array), and then iterate over each element in the input array, adding the values of each feature to the corresponding position in the output array.

Here's how the output array will look like after applying the transformation function:
```
[
   [5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
   [2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
   [7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
   [3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
   [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]
]
```
As you can see, the output array is a one-dimensional array where each element represents the sum of all the features that are present. In this case, the output array is simply the concatenation of the original input array, but with each element representing the sum of all the features that are present.
