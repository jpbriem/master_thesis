LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 1, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 8, 3], [0, 1, 8, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 3], [4, 1, 8, 3], [4, 1, 8, 3]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 8, 0, 3, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 3, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 7], [2, 6, 0, 0, 7], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 7], [2, 6, 0, 0, 7]]

Test case:
input: [[2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through each row of the input matrix and applying a series of transformations to it. These transformations include:

1. Swapping the first two elements of the row with the last two elements of the row (if the first element is not zero). This effectively reverses the order of the first two elements and leaves the rest of the row unchanged.
2. If the third element of the row is non-zero, then swap the third and fourth elements of the row. This effectively swaps the third and fourth elements of the row if they are both non-zero.
3. If the fifth element of the row is non-zero, then swap the fifth and sixth elements of the row. This effectively swaps the fifth and sixth elements of the row if they are both non-zero.
4. If the seventh element of the row is non-zero, then swap the seventh and eighth elements of the row. This effectively swaps the seventh and eighth elements of the row if they are both non-zero.
5. Finally, if any of the elements in the row have been swapped, then all elements after the swapped element are incremented by one. This effectively shifts all elements after the swapped element by one position to the left.

By applying these transformations to each row of the input matrix, we can transform the matrix into an output matrix that has the desired properties. Specifically, the output matrix will have the same number of rows as the input matrix, but the columns will be rearranged so that the first column contains only zeros, the second column contains only ones, and the remaining columns contain only the values from the original input matrix.
