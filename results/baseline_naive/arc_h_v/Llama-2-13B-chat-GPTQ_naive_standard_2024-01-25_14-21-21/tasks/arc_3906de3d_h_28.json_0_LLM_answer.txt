LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

In each of these examples, we can see that the output is a permutation of the input, but with certain values transformed (e.g., all 4s become 9s). This transformation pattern is not obvious from looking at the input and output alone, but it becomes more clear when we examine the patterns in the input and output more closely.

For example, in Example_1, we can see that every second value in the input is transformed into a 9. This is because the input has alternating values of 0 and 4, and every second value is a 4. Therefore, the output will have alternating values of 0 and 9, since 9 is the transformed version of 4.

Similarly, in Example_2, we can see that every third value in the input is transformed into a 9. This is because the input has alternating values of 0 and 4, and every third value is a 4. Therefore, the output will have alternating values of 0 and 9, since 9 is the transformed version of 4.

In Example_3, we can see that the input has a repeating pattern of 4, 0, 4, 0,..., and the output has a similar repeating pattern of 9, 9, 9, 9,.... This is because the transformation pattern is to replace every other value with a 9, so the output will have the same repeating pattern as the input, but with the replaced values transformed into 9s.

Therefore, based on these examples, we can see that the transformation pattern is to replace certain values in the input with their corresponding transformed versions, which are either 9 or 0.
