LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

In each of these examples, we can see that the input matrix is transformed into an output matrix with all zero values, except for the first row and column which contain the value 7. This transformation is achieved by applying a series of rotations to the input matrix, using the values in the first row and column as anchors.

The key insight here is that the rotation operations can be applied independently to each sub-matrix within the input matrix, without affecting the overall structure of the matrix. This allows us to transform the input matrix into an output matrix with all zero values, while preserving the relative positions of the elements within each sub-matrix.

This technique can be useful in various applications where it is necessary to transform a matrix into another matrix with specific properties, such as zero values or specific patterns. For example, this technique could be used in image processing to transform an image into a new image with specific features or patterns, or in data analysis to transform data into a more suitable format for further analysis.
