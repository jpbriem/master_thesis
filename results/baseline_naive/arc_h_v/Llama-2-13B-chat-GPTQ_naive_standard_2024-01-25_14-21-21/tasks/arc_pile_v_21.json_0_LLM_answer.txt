LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 7, 0, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 4], [6, 5, 0, 0, 4], [6, 5, 7, 9, 4]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 9], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [3, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [3, 8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [3, 8, 1, 7, 5, 9]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 7, 4, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [2, 0, 4, 0, 0], [2, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [2, 7, 4, 0, 1], [2, 7, 4, 0, 1]]

Test case:
input: [[3, 8, 5, 9, 2, 7], [0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7], [0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[3, 8, 5, 9, 2, 7], [0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7], [0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through each row of the input matrix and applying a series of transformations to it. These transformations include:

* Swapping the first two elements of the row with the last two elements of the previous row (if there is one). This has the effect of shuffling the elements of each row around so that they appear in a different order.
* Adding 5 to all elements of the row. This effectively "shifts" all the elements of each row upwards by 5 positions.
* If the sum of the elements of the row is greater than or equal to 9, then add 7 to the last element of the row. This effectively "adds" 7 to the end of each row if the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 9.

For example, consider the first input matrix:

[0, 5, 0, 0, 4]
[0, 5, 7, 0, 4]
[6, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 9, 0]
[6, 0, 0, 0, 4]

Applying the above transformations to this input matrix results in the following output matrix:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 4]
[6, 5, 0, 0, 4]
[6, 5, 7, 9, 4]

As you can see, the output matrix is simply the original input matrix with some elements shifted around and added to. Specifically, the first row has been swapped with the third row, and the second row has been swapped with the fourth row. Additionally, some elements have been added to certain rows based on the condition described above.
