LLM answer:

output: [[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]]

In each of these examples, we have a matrix `A` with dimensions `n x m`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. We want to transform `A` into a new matrix `B` with dimensions `n x k`, where `k` is some fixed integer value less than or equal to `m`.

The transformation is done by applying the following rules to each element of `A`:

* If the element is 0, leave it unchanged in `B`.
* If the element is greater than or equal to `k`, set its value to 0 in `B`.
* Otherwise (i.e., if the element is less than `k`), set its value to the corresponding element of `A` divided by `k`.

For example, in Example_1, the input matrix `A` has dimensions `4 x 5`, and we want to transform it into a matrix `B` with dimensions `4 x 3`. The elements of `A` are all nonzero, so we apply the above rules as follows:

* For the first row of `A`, since all elements are greater than or equal to 3, we set their values to 0 in `B`.
* For the second row of `A`, since only the third element is less than 3, we set its value to `3/3 = 1` in `B`.
* For the third row of `A`, since all elements are less than 3, we set their values to 0 in `B`.
* For the fourth row of `A`, since only the fifth element is greater than or equal to 3, we set its value to 0 in `B`.

Therefore, the output matrix `B` has the desired dimensions `4 x 3` and contains the transformed values of `A`.

Similarly, in Examples_2 and _3, we apply the same transformation rules to the input matrices `A` to obtain the desired outputs `B`.
