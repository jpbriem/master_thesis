LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 8, 0]]
output: [[7, 7, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]

Explanation of the algorithm:
The algorithm works by iterating through each row of the input matrix and applying a series of transformations to it. These transformations include:

1. Swapping the first two elements of the row with the last two elements of the row (if the first element is not equal to the last element). This is done to ensure that all rows have the same length and that the first element of each row is always non-zero.
2. Adding the value of the last element of the row to all elements of the row, except for the first element. This is done to ensure that all elements of each row are positive.
3. Multiplying the second element of the row by a factor of 2 (if the first element is not equal to the last element). This is done to ensure that all rows have the same sum.
4. Setting all elements of the row to zero if the first element is equal to the last element. This is done to ensure that all rows have the same number of non-zero elements.

After applying these transformations to each row of the input matrix, the output matrix is created by simply copying the transformed rows into the output matrix.

Note that the algorithm assumes that the input matrix has a fixed size, and that the size of each row is known in advance. If the input matrix has a variable size or if the size of each row needs to be determined dynamically, additional logic may be required to handle these cases.
