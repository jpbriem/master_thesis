LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 9, 9]]
output: [[7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7]]
output: [[9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 6, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7], [6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9]]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a 2D array of integers, where each element represents a character in a string. The task is to transform this array into another 2D array of integers, where each element represents the number of times a particular character appears in the original string.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple technique based on the idea of counting the number of occurrences of each character in the original string. We can iterate through each element of the input array and increment a counter for each character that appears in the current element. At the end of the iteration, we will have a 2D array of integers representing the number of times each character appears in the original string.

Here's the code for the solution:
```
function transform(arr) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let current = arr[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < current.length; j++) {
            let char = current[j];
            if (!result[char]) {
                result[char] = 0;
            }
            result[char]++;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
In this function, `transform(arr)` takes an input array `arr` and returns a transformed array `result`. The function iterates through each element of the input array using two nested loops. For each element `current` of the input array, it iterates through each character `char` in the current element using a second loop. If the character is not already present in the `result` array, it creates an entry for that character with a value of 0. Then, it increments the value of that entry by 1. Finally, it returns the `result` array.

Note that the output array `result` has the same shape as the input array `arr`, but its elements are integers instead of characters. Each element `result[char]` represents the number of times the corresponding character appears in the original string.
