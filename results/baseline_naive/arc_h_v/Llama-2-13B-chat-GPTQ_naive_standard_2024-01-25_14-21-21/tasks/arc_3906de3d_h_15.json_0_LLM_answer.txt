LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

In each of these examples, the input is a list of integers representing a matrix, and the output is the same matrix with all zeroes replaced by the value 3. This can be done using a simple loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix, checking each element to see if it is zero, and replacing it with the value 3 if it is.

For example, in Example_1, the input matrix is:
```
[
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```
And the desired output is:
```
[
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
]
```
As you can see, all of the zeroes have been replaced with the value 3.
