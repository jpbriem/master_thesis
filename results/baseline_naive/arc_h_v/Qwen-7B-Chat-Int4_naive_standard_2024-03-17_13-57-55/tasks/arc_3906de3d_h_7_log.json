The length of this list represents the number of rows and the value at each index represents the value at the corresponding position in the grid.\n\nThe function first initializes two sets, one for storing visited cells (`visited`) and another for storing directions (`directions`). It then defines a helper function `dfs` which performs depth-first search on the grid. \n\nIn `dfs`, we start by checking if the current cell `(x,y)` is within the bounds of the grid and if it has been visited before. If either condition is true, we return false indicating that there is no valid path from the starting point.\n\nIf the current cell is not visited yet, we mark it as visited and recursively call `dfs` on its neighbors using the `directions` set. We also add the current cell to the `visited` set so that we don't revisit any already visited cells.\n\nThe main function `findPaths` simply calls `dfs` with the starting point `(0,0)` and returns the count of paths found.\n\nNote that the implementation assumes that the grid contains only 0s and 7s. If the grid can contain other values as well, you may need to modify the code accordingly."
