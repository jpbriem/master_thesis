It starts by checking if the given board is valid according to the Sudoku rules. If the board is invalid, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it creates two lists of rows and columns to be filled.\n\nThe algorithm then enters a loop that continues until there are no more cells to fill. In each iteration of the loop, it finds the cell with the minimum value among the unvisited cells. It marks the cell as visited and removes it from both the rows and columns to be filled lists.\n\nNext, it tries filling all neighboring cells that are not already marked. For each neighboring cell, it checks if it has a value other than `'X'`, which means it has already been visited. If the neighboring cell does not have a value other than `'X'`, it fills the neighboring cell with the same value as the original cell and recursively calls the `solveSudoku` function on the updated board.\n\nAfter the neighboring cell has been filled, it unmarks the neighboring cell by setting its value back to `'X'`.\n\nFinally, the algorithm exits the loop when there are no more cells to fill. At this point, the board contains a complete solution to the Sudoku puzzle."
