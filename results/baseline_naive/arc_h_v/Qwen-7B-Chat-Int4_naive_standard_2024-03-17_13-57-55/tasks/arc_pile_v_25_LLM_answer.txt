class Solution:
    def removeSelfLoop(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # dp[i][j] is the number of ways to reach node i from node j with self-loops allowed.
        # We can use dynamic programming to fill in this table. For each edge (u, v), we have two cases:

        # Case 1: u and v are different nodes. In this case, there are no self-loops at all, so we simply add one to the count for reaching node u from node v.

        # Case 2: u and v are the same node. In this case, there is only one way to reach node u from node u, which is by taking a step back to node v. So we subtract one from the count for reaching node u from node v, since we don't want to double-count the steps that take us back to node v.

        n = len(edges)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for u in range(n):
            dp[u][u] += 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if edges[j][i]:
                    dp[j][i] -= 1
                    dp[j][i] += dp[i][j]
                    dp[i][j] += dp[j][i]

        ans = []
        visited = set()
        stack = [(0, -1)]
        while stack:
            node, parent = stack.pop()
            visited.add(node)
            ans.append([node])
            for neighbor in range(len(edges[node])):
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    stack.append((neighbor, node))
                    dp[neighbor][node] += dp[node][neighbor]
                    dp[neighbor][node] -= dp[neighbor][parent]
                    if dp[neighbor][node] == 0:
                        break

        return ans
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It fills in a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach node `i` from node `j`. The base case is when `i` and `j` are equal, in which case there is only one way to reach `i`, which is by taking a step back to `j`. Otherwise, we have two cases:

- If `u` and `v` are different nodes, then there are no self-loops at all, so we simply add one to the count for reaching `u` from `v`.
- If `u` and `v` are the same node, then there is only one way to reach `u` from `u`, which is by taking a step back to `v`. So we subtract one from the count for reaching `u` from `v`.

Once we have filled in the table `dp`, we can iterate over it to build up the answer. We start with an empty list `ans` and a set `visited` containing the starting node. We also create a stack `stack` containing the starting node and its parent. We then repeatedly pop elements off the stack and append them to `ans`, until we run out of elements to push onto the stack. During each iteration, we mark the current node as visited and check its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited yet, we add it to the stack along with its parent. Once we have processed all neighbors, we update the counts in `dp` accordingly and continue iterating until the stack is empty. Finally, we return the resulting list `ans`.
