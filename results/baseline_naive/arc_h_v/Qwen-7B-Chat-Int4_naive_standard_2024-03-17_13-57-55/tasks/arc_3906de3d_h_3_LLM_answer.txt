        return max_area
```

Explanation:

We use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We create a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum area that can be obtained by using the first i+1 heights from the top row and the first j heights from the left column.

The base case is when we have only one height on either side, which means we can obtain the maximum area by using that single height.

For the remaining cases, we check whether it's better to include or exclude the current height from our solution. If including the current height results in a larger area than excluding it, then we include it; otherwise, we exclude it.

At the end, we update the maximum area found so far to be the maximum among all areas obtained by using different combinations of heights. This gives us the final answer.
