Here's a Python solution that solves the problem using dynamic programming:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(A):
    m = len(A)
    n = len(A[0])
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if A[i-1][j-1] == 0:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

    result = []
    i = m
    j = n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if A[i-1][j-1] == 1:
            result.append(A[i-1][j])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i-1][j] >= dp[i][j-1]:
            result.append(A[i-1][j])
            i -= 1
        else:
            result.append(A[i][j-1])
            j -= 1

    return result[::-1]
```

The function `longest_common_subsequence` takes a list of lists `A` as input and returns a new list containing the longest common subsequence of all the elements in `A`. The algorithm works by building up a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the first `i` elements of `A` and the first `j` elements of `A`. If the corresponding element is zero, then the two sequences have no common elements, so we take the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`, which gives us the length of the longest common subsequence between the previous pair of elements. Otherwise, we take the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`, which gives us the length of the longest common subsequence between the current pair of elements.

Once we've built up the `dp` table, we can backtrack through it to construct the longest common subsequence itself. We start at the bottom-right corner of the table (`i=m` and `j=n`) and move left and down until we reach the top-left corner (`i=0` and `j=0`). At each step, we check whether the corresponding element of `A` is one or zero. If it's one, we append it to our result and move diagonally to the left and down. If it's zero, we either move left or down depending on which of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]` is smaller, and repeat this process until we reach the top-left corner. Finally, we reverse our result and return it.
