It fills in a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach node `i` from node `j`. The base case is when `i` and `j` are equal, in which case there is only one way to reach `i`, which is by taking a step back to `j`. Otherwise, we have two cases:\n\n- If `u` and `v` are different nodes, then there are no self-loops at all, so we simply add one to the count for reaching `u` from `v`.\n- If `u` and `v` are the same node, then there is only one way to reach `u` from `u`, which is by taking a step back to `v`. So we subtract one from the count for reaching `u` from `v`.\n\nOnce we have filled in the table `dp`, we can iterate over it to build up the answer. We start with an empty list `ans` and a set `visited` containing the starting node. We also create a stack `stack` containing the starting node and its parent. We then repeatedly pop elements off the stack and append them to `ans`, until we run out of elements to push onto the stack. During each iteration, we mark the current node as visited and check its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited yet, we add it to the stack along with its parent. Once we have processed all neighbors, we update the counts in `dp` accordingly and continue iterating until the stack is empty. Finally, we return the resulting list `ans`."
