Explanation:

The solution uses a stack to keep track of the rows and columns that need to be visited. The algorithm starts by visiting the top-left corner of the grid. It then iterates through all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and checks if there is an unvisited cell in the current row and column. If so, it adds the current cell to the stack and continues with the next direction. If there are no more unvisited cells in the current row and column, it moves on to the next row and column.

When the stack becomes empty, the algorithm has finished visiting all cells in the grid. At this point, it creates a list containing the connections between the cells. To create these connections, the algorithm looks at each cell in the top row and checks if there are any unvisited cells in the same row and column as the current cell. If so, it adds those cells to the list of connections. This process is repeated for the remaining rows until all cells have been connected.

Note that this solution assumes that the input grid is a valid matrix of size N x M, where N and M are positive integers. Additionally, the input grid contains only 0s and 1s, where 0 represents an obstacle and 1 represents an open space.
