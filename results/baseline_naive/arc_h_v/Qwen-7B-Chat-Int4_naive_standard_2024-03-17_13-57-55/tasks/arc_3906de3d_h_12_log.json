We will keep track of the number of cells that have been filled so far and update it whenever we fill a cell.\nHere's how we can implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n```\ndef fill_missing_values(matrix):\n    rows = len(matrix)\n    cols = len(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the number of filled cells to zero\n    num_filled_cells = 0\n    \n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if matrix[row][col] == 0:\n                # Check if there are any empty cells around us\n                neighbors = []\n                \n                if row > 0:\n                    neighbors.append(matrix[row-1][col])\n                    \n                if row < rows - 1:\n                    neighbors.append(matrix[row+1][col])\n                    \n                if col > 0:\n                    neighbors.append(matrix[row][col-1])\n                    \n                if col < cols - 1:\n                    neighbors.append(matrix[row][col+1])\n                    \n                # If there is at least one non-empty neighbor, fill in the value\n                if any(neighbors):\n                    matrix[row][col] = neighbors[0]\n                    num_filled_cells += 1\n                    \n    return matrix, num_filled_cells\n```\n\nThe `fill_missing_values` function takes a matrix as input and returns two values: the updated matrix with the missing values filled in, and the total number of cells that were filled.\n\nWe start by initializing the number of filled cells to zero. Then, we iterate over each cell in the matrix using nested loops. For each cell, we check if it has not yet been filled (i.e., its value is equal to 0). If it has not been filled, we check if there are any neighboring cells that have already been filled (i.e., their values are not equal to 0). If there is at least one non-empty neighbor, we fill in the value of the current cell with the value of the first non-empty neighbor we find, and increment the number of filled cells.\n\nFinally, we return the updated matrix and the total number of filled cells. Note that we could also modify the function to return the list of all the non-empty neighbors found, but for simplicity we only return the number of filled cells here."
