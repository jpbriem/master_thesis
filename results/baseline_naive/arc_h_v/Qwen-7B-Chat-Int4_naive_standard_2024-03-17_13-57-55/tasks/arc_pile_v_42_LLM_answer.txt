```

This solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the grid and find all the connected cells. The `visited` set keeps track of the cells that have already been visited, and the `components` list stores the connected components found so far.

The `find_neighbors` function recursively finds all the neighboring cells of a given cell by checking the values of its four adjacent cells. If a neighboring cell has the same value as the current cell, it is added to the list of neighbors. The `islands` function then calls this function for each cell in the grid that has the value 1, and returns the length of the list of connected components found.
