LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['i', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a], ['a', 'a', 'c', 'a], ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']]
output: [['i', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a], ['c', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['b', 'b', 'a', 'a']]

Example_2:
input: [['c', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['h', 'a', 'h', 'h], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['c', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['h', 'h', 'h', 'a], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Example_3:
input: [['a', 'e', 'e', 'e], ['b', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['a', 'f', 'f', 'a], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['e', 'e', 'e', 'a], ['b', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['f', 'f', 'a', 'a], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Test case:
input: [['j', 'a', 'a', 'a], ['a', 'g', 'g', 'g], ['a', 'a', 'f', 'a], ['a', 'd', 'a', 'a']]

LLM answer:

output: [['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['g', 'g', 'g', 'a'], ['f', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

The output of each example is a list where each element is a string representing an item in the input list, but with all occurrences of the letter 'a' replaced by 'e'.

### 4.2.5. Transformation Patterns

In order to understand the transformation patterns used in this work, we need to define some terms. We will use the term "transformation" to refer to any operation that changes the structure or content of data. In our context, transformations can be either simple operations (such as replacing one value with another) or more complex ones (such as sorting, filtering, grouping, etc.).

We will also use the term "pattern" to refer to a set of rules defining how a given transformation should be applied to a piece of data. A pattern consists of two parts: a set of conditions and a set of actions. The conditions specify under what circumstances the transformation should be applied, while the actions describe exactly what should be done when the conditions are met.

For example, consider the transformation pattern used in Example_1 above. This pattern has two conditions:The first condition checks if the current item contains the letter 'a'. If it does, then the action replaces all occurrences of 'a' with 'e'. Otherwise, no change is made.The second condition checks if the next item contains the letter 'a'. If it does, then the action replaces all occurrences of 'a' with 'e'. Otherwise, no change is made.

Similarly, the transformation pattern used in Example_2 above has two conditions:The first condition checks if the current item contains the letter 'h'. If it does, then the action replaces all occurrences of 'h' with 'a'. Otherwise, no change is made.The second condition checks if the next item contains the letter 'h'. If it does, then the action replaces all occurrences of 'h' with 'a'. Otherwise, no change is made.

Finally, the transformation pattern used in Example_3 above has two conditions:The first condition checks if the current item contains the letter 'e'. If it does, then the action replaces all occurrences of 'e' with 'a'. Otherwise, no change is made.The second condition checks if the next item contains the letter 'e'. If it does, then the action replaces all occurrences of 'e' with 'a'. Otherwise, no change is made.

Note that these patterns are not specific to any particular programming language or framework; they could be implemented using any tool or technique that supports the concept of conditional statements and loops. However, the choice of which pattern to apply depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

## 4.3. Implementation

In this section, we will present the implementation of the proposed algorithm for generating random permutations of strings. We will start by describing the overall architecture of the system, followed by a detailed description of each component.

### 4.3.1. Architecture

Figure 4.1 shows the high-level architecture of the system. It consists of three main components:A user interface that allows the user to enter the desired length of the permutation and select the type of transformation to be applied.A generator module that takes the user's input and generates a random permutation according to the selected transformation pattern.An output module that displays the generated permutation to the user.

### 4.3.2. User Interface

The user interface is implemented using a web page that runs in a web browser. The page includes two text fields:One field allows the user to enter the desired length of the permutation. Another field allows the user to select the type of transformation to be applied (either "replace all occurrences of 'a' with 'e'" or "replace all occurrences of 'h' with 'a'").Once the user has entered their preferences, they click a button to generate the permutation.

### 4.3.3. Generator Module

The generator module is responsible for taking the user's input and generating a random permutation according to the selected transformation pattern. It consists of two main submodules:A random number generator that produces a sequence of random integers between 0 and the length of the input string minus one.A permutation builder that uses the random numbers produced by the previous submodule to construct a random permutation of the input string.

The random number generator works by creating an array of
