LLM answer:

output: [['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['d', 'd', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'j', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Explanation of test cases:
The first example is a simple permutation, where each element in the output array has been moved one position to the right compared to its corresponding element in the input array.
In the second example, we see that some elements have been removed from the input array (the d's) and replaced with j's. This means that there was no way for us to move these elements around without changing their order. So instead, we just remove them completely.
Finally, in the third example, we see that two elements have been added to the input array (the d's). We can add these elements anywhere in the output array, so we do not need to change any other elements.
