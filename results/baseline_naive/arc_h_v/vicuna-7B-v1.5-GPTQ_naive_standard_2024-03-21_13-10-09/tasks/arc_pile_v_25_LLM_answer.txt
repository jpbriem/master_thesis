Explanation:
In the first step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels in the string. In this case, the maximum number of vowels is 1.

In the second step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels in the string that are not adjacent to the maximum number of vowels. In this case, the maximum number of vowels is 1, and there are no vowels that are not adjacent to the maximum number of vowels.

In the third step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels in the string that are not adjacent to the maximum number of vowels and are not adjacent to the last vowel. In this case, the maximum number of vowels is 1, and there are no vowels that are not adjacent to the maximum number of vowels and are not adjacent to the last vowel.

In the fourth step, we need to find the maximum number of vowels in the string that are not adjacent to the maximum number of vowels and are not adjacent to the last vowel and are not adjacent to the last consonant. In this case, the maximum number of vowels is 1, and there are no vowels that are not adjacent to the maximum number of vowels and are not adjacent to the last vowel and are not adjacent to the last consonant.
