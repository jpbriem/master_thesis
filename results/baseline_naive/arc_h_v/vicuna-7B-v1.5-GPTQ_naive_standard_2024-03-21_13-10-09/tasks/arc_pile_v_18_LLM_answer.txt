Explanation:

1. In the first test case, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence of the given strings. The longest increasing subsequence is the sequence of characters that can be appended to the beginning of the input strings to form a new string that is longer than any other such sequence.
2. To find the longest increasing subsequence, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1) to store the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence for each row and column. We can then iterate through each row and column, and for each position i, we can find the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at position i. We can do this by iterating through the other rows and columns and finding the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at position i+1.
3. We can then return the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence for each row and column.
