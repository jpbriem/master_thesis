LLM answer:

output: [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]]

Explanation of Example_1:
The first row is transformed into a new array with all elements set to zero except for the last element which is set to six. This process repeats until there are no more nonzero values in the array. In this example, we have two iterations before reaching the final result.

Explanation of Example_2:
This example has three iterations. The first iteration sets all elements to zero except for the last one which is set to six. The second iteration sets all elements to zero except for the third and sixth ones which are both set to six. Finally, the third iteration sets all elements to zero except for the fourth and fifth ones which are both set to six.

Explanation of Example_3:
In this example, we start by setting all elements to zero except for the first one which is set to six. Then, we set all elements to zero except for the second and sixth ones which are both set to six. Finally, we set all elements to zero except for the third and seventh ones which are both set to six.

Explanation of Test case:
We start by setting all elements to zero except for the first one which is set to six. Then, we set all elements to zero except for the second and sixth ones which are both set to six. Finally, we set all elements to zero except for the third and seventh ones which are both set to six.
