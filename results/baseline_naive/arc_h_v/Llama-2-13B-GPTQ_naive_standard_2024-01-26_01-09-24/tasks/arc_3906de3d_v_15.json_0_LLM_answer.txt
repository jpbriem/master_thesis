LLM answer:

output: [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]]

Explanation of Example_1:
The first row is transformed into a new array with all elements set to zero except for the last element which is set to six. This process repeats until there are no more rows in the original array.

Explanation of Example_2:
The second row is transformed into a new array with all elements set to zero except for the first element which is set to six. This process repeats until there are no more rows in the original array.

Explanation of Example_3:
The third row is transformed into a new array with all elements set to zero except for the first two elements which are set to six. This process repeats until there are no more rows in the original array.

Explanation of Test case:
The test case is an example of how the algorithm works on a larger input. It starts by setting all elements to zero except for the first element which is set to six. Then it sets all elements to zero except for the first three elements which are set to six. Finally, it sets all elements to zero except for the first four elements which are set to six.
