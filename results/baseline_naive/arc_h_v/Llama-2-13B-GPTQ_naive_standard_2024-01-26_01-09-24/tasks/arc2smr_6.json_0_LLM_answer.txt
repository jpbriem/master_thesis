Explanation:
The above example is a simple example of how to transform an array into another array with different values. In this example, we have two arrays that need to be transformed. The first array has three elements, while the second array has four elements. We will use the following rules to transform each element in the first array into an element in the second array:
Rule 1: If the value of the first array is less than or equal to zero, then it should be replaced by the value of the second array.
Rule 2: If the value of the first array is greater than zero but less than or equal to one, then it should be multiplied by two and added to the value of the second array.
Rule 3: If the value of the first array is greater than one, then it should be divided by two and subtracted from the value of the second array.
For example, let's take a look at the first rule. According to this rule, if the value of the first array is less than or equal to zero, then it should be replaced by the value of the second array. This means that if the value of the first array is zero, then it should be replaced by the value of the second array, which is three. Similarly, if the value of the first array is negative, then it should also be replaced by the value of the second array.
Now, let's take a look at the second rule. According to this rule, if the value of the first array is greater than zero but less than or equal to one, then it should be multiplied by two and added to the value of the second array. This means that if the value of the first array is one, then it should be multiplied by two and added to the value of the second array, which is six. Similarly, if the value of the first array is two, then it should also be multiplied by two and added to the value of the second array.
Finally, let's take a look at the third rule. According to this rule, if the value of the first array is greater than one, then it should be divided by two and subtracted from the value of the second array. This means that if the value of the first array is three, then it should be divided by two and subtracted from the value of the second array, which is nine. Similarly, if the value of the first array is four, then it should also be divided by two and subtracted from the value of the second array.
By applying these rules to all the elements in the first array, we can see that the output array matches the expected output array. Therefore, our solution satisfies
