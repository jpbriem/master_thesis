Each cell in this grid will eventually contain the maximum value found in any cell within its corresponding connected component in the original grid.\n  * We iterate over each cell in the original grid. If the cell is zero, we skip it because it doesn't belong to any square.\n  * For each non-zero cell, we find all other cells that belong to the same square using breadth-first search. We use a set to keep track of the visited cells and a queue to perform the search. We add all neighboring cells that have the same value as the current cell to the queue, and repeat until there are no more unvisited neighbors.\n  * Once we have identified all cells in the square, we update the corresponding cells in the connected components grid by setting their values to the maximum value found in any cell within the square plus one. This ensures that adjacent squares get distinct values in the output grid.\n\nFinally, we return the connected components grid as the result.\nLet me know if you have any questions about this implementation!"
