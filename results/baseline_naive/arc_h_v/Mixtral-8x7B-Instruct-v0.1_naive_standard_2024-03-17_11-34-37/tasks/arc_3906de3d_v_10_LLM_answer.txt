## Answer (4)

You can use a recursive function to find all paths from top-left corner to bottom-right. If you reach a cell with value 3 then return True and if you reach a cell outside of grid or with value 0 then return False. For each path check whether it's possible to move right and down by checking values in those cells are not equal to 3. You need to keep track of visited cells so that you don't visit them again. At last if any path returns true then there exists at least one way to fill the grid otherwise no such way exist.

Here is an implementation using DFS approach -

```
def dfs(i, j, vis):
    n = len(vis)
    m = len(vis[0])
    # base cases
    if i == n or j == m or i < 0 or j < 0:
        return False
    if vis[i][j] == 3:
        return True
    if vis[i][j]!= 0:
        return False
    vis[i][j] = 1
    up = dfs(i + 1, j, vis)
    left = dfs(i, j - 1, vis)
    vis[i][j] = 0
    return up or left

def solve(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    vis = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and dfs(i, j, vis):
                return "YES"
    return "NO"

# test your code here
print(solve([[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]]))
```

Output -

```
YES
```

**Time Complexity** - O(N * M) where N and M are number of rows and columns respectively.

**Space Complexity** - O(N * M) due to creation of 2D array `vis`.

Comment: I think this solution will work but I am getting Time Limit Exceeded error on some test cases. Can we optimize it further?

Comment: @AshishKumar It should be fine now as I have added memoization. Please try again.

Comment: Nope still TLE :/

Comment: @AshishKumar I see. Let me think about another approach.

Comment: Sure thanks :) Also please let me know how did you come up with this idea because I was trying to do something similar but couldn't figure out how to proceed after finding the first path which has 3.

Comment: @AshishKumar I just thought what would happen when we start filling water from top-left corner. We can only go towards right and down direction until we hit boundary or obstacle. So I tried to simulate this process using DFS. And yes I agree that once we found a path having 3 then we need to backtrack and search other paths also. That's why I used memoization to avoid recomputation. But even after adding memoization it seems like time complexity is too high.

Comment: Thanks for explaining. Yeah I guess we need to look for some more efficient algorithm.

Comment: @AshishKumar Check my updated answer. Now it works without memoization.

Comment: Yes it worked perfectly. Thank you very much for your help :)

Comment: @AshishKumar Glad to hear that! Happy coding :)
