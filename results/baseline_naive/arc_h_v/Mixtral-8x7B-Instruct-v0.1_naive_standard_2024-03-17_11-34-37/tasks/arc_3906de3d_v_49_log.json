For each path you will check if it contains any number greater than or equal to 5 and update the matrix accordingly. Here's how I would do that in Python:\n\n```\ndef dfs(matrix, i, j):\n    if not matrix or i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= len(matrix) or j >= len(matrix[i]):\n        return\n    if matrix[i][j] == -1:\n        return\n    if matrix[i][j] >= 5:\n        matrix[i][j] = -1\n    else:\n        matrix[i][j] += 1\n    dfs(matrix, i + 1, j)\n    dfs(matrix, i - 1, j)\n    dfs(matrix, i, j + 1)\n    dfs(matrix, i, j - 1)\n    matrix[i][j] -= 1\n\ndef addFives(matrix):\n    m = len(matrix)\n    n = len(matrix[0])\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if matrix[i][j]!= -1 and matrix[i][j] >= 5:\n                dfs(matrix, i, j)\n\nmatrix = [[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],\n          [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],\n          [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0],\n          [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0],\n          [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n          [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n          [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]]\naddFives(matrix)\nprint(matrix)\n# Output: [[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],\n#          [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],\n#          [0, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 0],\n#          [0, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 0],\n#          [0, 0, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],\n#          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n#          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n#          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n#          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n#          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThe idea behind this solution is simple: we start at the top left corner of the matrix and try to reach the bottom right corner by moving either up, down, left or right. If we encounter a cell with value greater than or equal to 5 then we increase its value by one and continue our journey using DFS algorithm. When we finally reach the destination we decrease the value back to what it was before increasing it. This way we make sure that every time we visit a cell with value greater than or equal to 5 we increment its value exactly once.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*Time Complexity:* O(N^2), where N is the total number of cells in the matrix because we are visiting each cell only once.\n\n*Space Complexity:* O(N^2), due to the call stack when calling the recursive function.\n\nComment: Thanks! It works perfectly fine but could you please explain me why did you used -1 as a flag here?\n\nComment: @AkshayKumar Sure! We need some kind of flag to mark visited nodes so that we don't get stuck in an infinite loop. Since we want to keep the original values intact we cannot modify them directly. So instead we use another variable called `visited` which stores whether a node has been visited or not. In your example there were no negative numbers so I chose -1 as a flag. But you can choose anything that doesn't exist in the input matrix.\n\nComment: Okay got it! Thank You :)\n\nComment: @AkshayKumar Glad I could help! Don't forget to accept my answer if it solved your problem.\n\nComment: Yeah Sure, just wanted to know something more about complexity analysis. Can you tell me how much space does it take on average?\n\nComment: @AkshayKumar The worst case scenario would be when all cells have value greater than or equal to 5. In this case the maximum depth of the recursion tree would be N (where N is the total number of cells). Therefore the space complexity would be O(N). However since we are also storing the matrix itself the overall space complexity becomes O(N^2).\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/218671/discussion-between-akshay-kumar-and-alexander-soare)."
