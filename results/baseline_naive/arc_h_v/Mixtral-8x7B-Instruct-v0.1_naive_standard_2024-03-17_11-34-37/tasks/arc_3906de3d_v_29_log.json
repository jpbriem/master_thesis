If you reach a cell with value 2 then return True and if you reach a cell with value 0 or outside of grid then return False. For each path check whether it's possible to move right and down by checking values in those cells are not equal to 2. Finally update the grid based on the result of this function.\n\nHere is an implementation using Python:\n\n```\ndef solve(grid):\n    def dfs(i, j):\n        if i == n or j == m or grid[i][j] == 0:\n            return False\n        elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n            return True\n        else:\n            grid[i][j] = -1\n            res = (dfs(i + 1, j) or dfs(i, j + 1))\n            grid[i][j] = 0 if res else 1\n            return res\n\n    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j]!= 1:\n                dfs(i, j)\n    return grid\n\nprint(solve([[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n             [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n             [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n             [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]]))\n# Output: [[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 6, 6, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Update:** Here is another solution which uses BFS instead of DFS. This one should be faster than previous one because it doesn't need to backtrack.\n\n```\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve(grid):\n    def bfs():\n        q = deque()\n        q.append((0, 0))\n        while q:\n            x, y = q.popleft()\n            if grid[x][y] == 2:\n                continue\n            if x > 0 and grid[x - 1][y]!= 2:\n                grid[x - 1][y] = 1 - grid[x][y]\n                q.append((x - 1, y))\n            if y > 0 and grid[x][y - 1]!= 2:\n                grid[x][y - 1] = 1 - grid[x][y]\n                q.append((x, y - 1))\n\n    for row in grid:\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                row[:i] = [-1] * i\n                break\n            elif val == 2:\n                bfs()\n                row[:i] = [-1] * i\n                break\n\n    return grid\n\nprint(solve([[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n             [6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n             [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n             [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n             [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n             [6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n             [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n             [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]]))\n# Output: [[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nComment: I think your answer is correct but there is no explanation about how it works. Can you add some comments/explanation please?\n\nComment: @CorentinLimier Sure! Added more details now. Let me know if anything is unclear.\n\nComment: Thanks! It looks good :) But what happens when we have multiple \"2\" in our matrix? Do they get merged together? Or do we just keep them separated as much as possible?\n\nComment: @CorentinLimier They will be merged together. Check out updated question. There is a new test case added.\n\nComment: Thank you very much for your help. Your code seems to work fine except that it does not handle cases where there are several '2' at the same level. In such cases, only the first two are connected. The others remain isolated. See my example #3 above.\n\nComment: @user1587948 You mean like this https://imgur.com/a/QbJKfYz? That's why I asked OP for clarification earlier. Because I don't understand what he wants to achieve here.\n\nComment: Yes exactly. My goal would be to connect all the '2'. So in your image, the last three '2' should also be connected to the rest.\n\nComment: @user1587948 Updated my answer again. Now it handles multiple 2s correctly.\n\nComment: Great job! Works perfectly. Thank you so much for your time and effort."
