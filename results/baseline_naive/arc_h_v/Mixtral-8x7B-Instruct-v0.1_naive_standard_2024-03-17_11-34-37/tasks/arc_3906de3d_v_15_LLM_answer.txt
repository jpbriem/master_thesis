## Answer (4)

You can use a recursive function to find all paths from top-left corner to bottom-right. If you reach a cell with value of 3 then return True and if any path returns true then fill that row/column with zeroes. Here's how it would look like in Python:

```
def dfs(i, j, m):
    if i == len(m)-1 or j == len(m[0])-1: # base case
        return False
    elif m[i][j] == 3:
        return True
    else:
        m[i][j] = -1
        res = (dfs(i+1, j, m) or dfs(i, j+1, m))
        m[i][j] = 6
        return res

def solve(m):
    nrows = len(m)
    ncols = len(m[0])
    for i in range(nrows):
        if dfs(i, 0, m):
            for j in range(ncols):
                m[i][j] = 0
            break
    for j in range(ncols):
        if dfs(0, j, m):
            for i in range(nrows):
                m[i][j] = 0
            break
    return m
```

Here are some test cases:
