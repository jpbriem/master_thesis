## Answer (4)

You can use a recursive function to find all paths from top-left corner to bottom-right. For each path you check if it's valid and update your answer accordingly. Here is an example implementation in Python:

```
def solve(grid):
    def dfs(x, y):
        if x == n or y == m:
            return True
        if grid[x][y] == 0:
            return False
        temp = grid[x][y]
        grid[x][y] = 0
        res = dfs(x + 1, y) or dfs(x, y + 1)
        grid[x][y] = temp
        return res

    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j]!= 0:
                if dfs(i, j):
                    ans.append([row[:] for row in grid])
    return ans
```

This solution has time complexity of O(N^2 * 2^(N*M)) where N and M are dimensions of input matrix. This is because there are at most 2^(N*M) possible paths and we need to traverse them all. Space complexity is also O(N^2).

**Update:** If you want to get only one valid path then you can modify this algorithm by adding some extra logic inside `dfs()`. You will have to keep track of last visited cell on current path and when you reach bottom right cell just copy that path into final result. Also note that now you don't need to store all valid paths so space complexity becomes O(N^2).

Here is updated code snippet:

```
def solve(grid):
    def dfs(x, y, prev_x, prev_y):
        if x == n or y == m:
            return True
        if grid[x][y] == 0:
            return False
        temp = grid[x][y]
        grid[x][y] = 0
        res = dfs(x + 1, y, x, y) or dfs(x, y + 1, x, y)
        grid[x][y] = temp
        if res:
            if x == n - 1 and y == m - 1:
                path.append(temp)
                ans = [row[:] for row in grid]
                path.pop()
            elif not path:
                path.append((prev_x, prev_y))
        return res

    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    path = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j]!= 0:
                if dfs(i, j, -1, -1):
                    return ans
```

Comment: Thanks! I was wondering how could I change the above code such that instead of returning all valid paths, it returns only one valid path. Any ideas?

Comment: @user56789 Sure, please see my updated answer.

Comment: Thank you very much! That makes sense. However, I am getting an error saying "NameError: name 'ans' is not defined". Do you know why this might be happening?

Comment: @user56789 Sorry about that, I forgot to define `ans` variable before using it. Please see updated code again.

Comment: No problem! It works perfectly fine now. Just out of curiosity, do you think there would be any way to make the runtime faster than O(N^2 \* 2^(N\*M))? Or is this already optimal?

Comment: @user56789 Yes, I believe that this solution is far from being optimal. The main issue here is that we try every single path which leads to exponential time complexity. In general case finding even one valid path may take up to O(2^(N*M)). But since you mentioned that you always start with zeroes in first two rows/columns then maybe there exists more efficient approach. Unfortunately I cannot come up with anything better right now :(
