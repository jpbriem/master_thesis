If you reach a cell with value of 6 then return False and stop traversing further in that path. For other cells just check if they are already visited or not. If not then mark them as visited and call the same function for next row and column.\n\nHere's an implementation using DFS approach -\n\n```\ndef dfs(i, j, grid):\n    n = len(grid)\n    m = len(grid[0])\n\n    # Base condition\n    if i == n-1 and j == m-1:\n        return True\n\n    if i >= n or j >= m or grid[i][j] == 6:\n        return False\n\n    temp = grid[i][j]\n    grid[i][j] = 6\n\n    res = (dfs(i+1, j, grid) or dfs(i, j+1, grid))\n\n    grid[i][j] = temp\n\n    return res\n\ndef maxArea(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0\n\n    ans = 0\n    n = len(grid)\n    m = len(grid[0])\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j]!= 6:\n                ans = max(ans, dfs(i, j, grid)*(n-i)*(m-j))\n\n    return ans\n```\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N*M) where N and M are number of rows and columns respectively.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(N*M) due to recursion stack space.\n\nComment: I think this solution will work but it has time complexity of O(2^(N*M)). Can we do better than this?\n\nComment: @AshishSingh Nope, there isn't any way to reduce the time complexity below O(N\\*M). The reason being even though we have two choices at each step, we need to visit every single cell once so that we don't miss out on any possible maximum area.\n\nComment: Thanks for your answer. It works perfectly fine. But I am still confused about how did you calculate the time complexity. As per my understanding, since we are visiting every node twice, hence total nodes visited would be 2*(N*M), which makes it O(N*M). Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nComment: @AshishSingh Yes, you are absolutely right! My bad, I made a mistake while calculating the time complexity. Thank you for pointing it out :)\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI was able to solve this problem by creating a helper method called \"findMaxPath\" which returns the maximum path length starting from a given point. This method uses Depth First Search algorithm to explore all possible paths.\n\nThe main method \"maxArea\" calls the helper method for every non-zero element present in the matrix and keeps track of the maximum path found till now.\n\nBelow is the code snippet :\n\n```\npublic int maxArea(int[][] mat){\n    int maxPathLength = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n    for(int i=0;i<mat.length;i++){\n        for(int j=0;j<mat[0].length;j++){\n            if(mat[i][j]!=0 && mat[i][j]!=6){\n                maxPathLength = Math.max(maxPathLength, findMaxPath(mat, i, j));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return maxPathLength;\n}\n\nprivate int findMaxPath(int[][] mat, int i, int j){\n    //base cases\n    if(i==0 || j==0 || i==mat.length-1 || j==mat[0].length-1){\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if(mat[i][j]==6){\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int up = 0, down = 0, left = 0, right = 0;\n\n    if(i>0 && mat[i-1][j]!=6){\n        up = findMaxPath(mat, i-1, j);\n    }\n\n    if(j>0 && mat[i][j-1]!=6){\n        left = findMaxPath(mat, i, j-1);\n    }\n\n    if(i<mat.length-1 && mat[i+1][j]!=6){\n        down = findMaxPath(mat, i+1, j);\n    }\n\n    if(j<mat[0].length-1 && mat[i][j+1]!=6){\n        right = findMaxPath(mat, i, j+1);\n    }\n\n    return Math.max(Math.max(up, down), Math.max(left, right)) + 1;\n}\n```\n\nThis solution has Time Complexity of O(N*M) because we are visiting every node only once. Space Complexity is also O(N*M) because of the recursion stack space used during DFS."
