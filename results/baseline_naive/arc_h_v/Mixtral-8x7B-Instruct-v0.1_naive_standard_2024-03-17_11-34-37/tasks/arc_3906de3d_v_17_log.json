For each path you will check if it's valid or not and update your answer accordingly. Here is an example of how this could be done in Python:\n\n```\ndef solve(grid, x, y):\n    # Base cases when we reach end of grid\n    if x == len(grid) - 1 and y == len(grid[0]) - 1:\n        return True\n    if x >= len(grid) or y >= len(grid[0]):\n        return False\n\n    # If current cell has value 0 then no need to explore further as there are no walls\n    if grid[x][y] == 0:\n        return False\n\n    temp = grid[x][y]\n    grid[x][y] = 0\n\n    # Checking both directions\n    res = solve(grid, x + 1, y) or solve(grid, x, y + 1)\n\n    grid[x][y] = temp\n    return res\n\ndef maxArea(grid):\n    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    ans = 0\n    for i in range(m):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j]:\n                ans = max(ans, solve(grid, i, j))\n    return ans\n```\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N^2 * 2^(N*M)), where N and M are dimensions of input matrix. This is because at every step we have two choices either move right or down. So total number of paths would be 2^(N*M). And for each path we are doing some constant work which includes checking boundary conditions and updating grid values. Hence time complexity becomes O(N^2 * 2^(N*M)).\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(N*M), due to recursion stack space.\n\nComment: I think that the time complexity should be O(2^(N\\*M)\\*N^2) since you visit each node twice. Also, why do you set the visited nodes to zero? Is it necessary?\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin Yes, you are correct about visiting each node twice but still the overall time complexity remains same. We don't really need to set visited nodes to zero. It was just my mistake while writing code. Thanks for pointing out!\n\nComment: The time complexity is actually O(2^(N\\*M)*N^2) since you visit each node twice. You also change the grid so that you cannot reuse the result of previous calls with the same arguments.\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin Nope, Time complexity is O(N^2 \\* 2^(N*M)). Since for each call on grid we make only two recursive calls one for moving right and other for moving down. So total number of calls made by any single call is always less than equal to 2. Therefore total number of calls made during entire execution is bounded by 2^(N*M). Now for each call we are doing some constant amount of work which involves checking boundary conditions and updating grid values. Hence time complexity becomes O(N^2 \\* 2^(N*M)).\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin Regarding changing grid values, yes you are correct that we cannot reuse results of previous calls with same arguments. But that doesn't affect our time complexity calculation. Because even though we might be making redundant calculations, they are still part of our algorithm and hence must be included in time complexity analysis.\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/251689/discussion-between-davide-visentin-and-anurag-verma).\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin Sure, let's continue here itself. As per me, time complexity is calculated based upon what operations are being performed inside the loop. In this case, we are performing two recursive calls for each iteration. That means for each iteration we are adding two more iterations to our recursion tree. Hence total number of iterations become 2^(N*M). And for each iteration we are doing some constant amount of work which includes checking boundary conditions and updating grid values. Hence time complexity becomes O(N^2 \\* 2^(N*M)).\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin I agree that we are visiting each node twice. But that doesn't mean that we are making double the number of iterations. Each iteration corresponds to a unique path from start to end point. When we visit a node second time, it simply implies that we found another path from start to end point through that node. Both these paths are different and hence count towards our time complexity.\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin To put it differently, consider a simple problem of finding all subsets of given array. Suppose size of array is N. Then total number of subsets possible is 2^N. Why? Because for each element in array we have two choices whether to include it in subset or exclude it. Similarly, in this problem for each node we have two choices whether to go right or down. Hence total number of paths possible is 2^(N*M).\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin One last thing, suppose we didn't change grid values and instead used some boolean flag to mark visited cells. Would that reduce our time complexity? Absolutely not! Because now we would have to perform additional checks before making recursive calls to ensure that we haven't already visited those cells. These extra checks would add up to our time complexity.\n\nComment: @AnuragVerma I understand your reasoning, however, I am pretty sure that the time complexity is indeed O(2^(N*M)*N^2). Consider the following scenario: imagine that you have a grid of dimension N=M=1000. At the first level of the recursion tree, you have 2000 nodes. However, after the first level, you have 2000 nodes at the second level too, plus the ones at the first level that were not pruned away. After the third level, you have again 2000 new nodes, plus the ones at the first and second levels that were not pruned away. Etc...\n\nComment: @AnuragVerma...so, at the final level, you have 2000 nodes, plus the ones at the previous 999 levels that were not pruned away. Thus, the total number of nodes in the recursion tree is 2000+2000+...+2000 (1000 times)=O(2^(N*M)*N^2).\n\nComment: @DavideVisentin Ahh..I see your point now. My bad, I misunderstood your argument earlier. Yes, you are absolutely correct. Total number of nodes in recursion tree would be sum of geometric series which comes out to be O(2^(N*M) \\* N^2). Thank you for explaining patiently :)\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nHere is a solution using dynamic programming. First, note that the maximum area is obtained by choosing the largest rectangle whose upper left corner is at position (i, j) such that the rectangle does not contain any wall. Such a rectangle exists if and only if the square at position (i, j) contains water and the squares above and to the left of it contain land.\n\nLet dp[i][j] denote the length of the longest horizontal segment of water starting at position (i, j) and going to the right. Note that dp[i][j] depends only on the state of the squares at positions (k, j) for k < i. Moreover, dp[i][j] is non decreasing along rows.\n\nSimilarly, let dq[i][j] denote the length of the longest vertical segment of water starting at position (i, j) and going downwards. Note that dq[i][j] depends only on the state of the squares at positions (i, k) for k < j. Moreover, dq[i][j] is non decreasing along columns.\n\nThen, the maximum area obtainable from position (i, j) is min(dp[i][j], dq[i][j]).\n\nThe pseudocode is as follows:\n\n```\nfor i := 1 to n do {\n   dp[i][0] := 0;\n   for j := 1 to m do {\n      if board[i][j] == '.' then {\n         dp[i][j] := dp[i][j-1];\n         if board[i-1][j] == '.' then {\n            dp[i][j] += 1;\n         }\n      } else {\n         dp[i][j] := 0;\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nfor j := 1 to m do {\n   dq[0][j] := 0;\n   for i := 1 to n do {\n      if board[i][j] == '.' then {\n         dq[i][j] := dq[i-1][j];\n         if board[i][j-1] == '.' then {\n            dq[i][j] += 1;\n         }\n      } else {\n         dq[i][j] := 0;\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nmaximum_area := 0;\nfor i := 1 to n do {\n   for j := 1 to m do {\n      if board[i][j] == '.' then {\n         maximum_area := max(maximum_area, min(dp[i][j], dq[i][j]));\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the time complexity is O(nm) and the space complexity is O(min(n, m))."
