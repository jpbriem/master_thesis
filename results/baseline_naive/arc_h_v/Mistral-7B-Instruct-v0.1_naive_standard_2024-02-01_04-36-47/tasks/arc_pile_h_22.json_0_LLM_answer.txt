LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', 'd', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', 'i', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', 'b', '.', '.', 'b'], ['h', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']]
output: [['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['d', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['i', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['b', 'b', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['h', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']]

Example_2:
input: [['.', '.', 'h', 'h', 'h'], ['.', 'd', '.', 'd', '.'], ['b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'f', '.', '.', '.']]
output: [['h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.'], ['d', 'd', '.', '.', '.'], ['b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['f', '.', '.', '.', '.']]

Example_3:
input: [['a', 'a', '.', 'a', '.'], ['c', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', 'd', '.', '.'], ['h', '.', 'h', '.', '.'], ['.', 'f', 'f', '.', '.']]
output: [['a', 'a', 'a', '.', '.'], ['c', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['d', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['h', 'h', '.', '.', '.'], ['f', 'f', '.', '.', '.']]

Test case:
input: [['.', '.', '.', 'e'], ['.', '.', 'g', '.'], ['f', '.', 'f', '.'], ['a', 'a', '.', '.']]

LLM answer:

output: [['e', '.', '.', '.'], ['g', '.', '.', '.'], ['f', 'f', '.', '.'], ['a', 'a', '.', '.']]

Note that in this problem, we can assume that there is only one character between each pair of dots. Also, if there are multiple characters between two dots, they will be treated as a single entity (e.g., "ab" will be treated as "ab").
