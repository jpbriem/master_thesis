LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['.', '.', 'd', '.', '.], ['b', '.', '.', 'b', 'b], ['.', '.', 'f', '.', '.], ['a', 'a', 'a', '.', '.], ['.', '.', 'e', 'e', '.']]
output: [['d', '.', '.', '.', '.], ['b', 'b', 'b', '.', '.], ['f', '.', '.', '.', '.], ['a', 'a', 'a', '.', '.], ['e', 'e', '.', '.', '.']]

Example_2:
input: [['.', 'b', '.', 'b], ['.', 'a', '.', '.], ['f', '.', '.', '.], ['g', 'g', '.', '.']]
output: [['b', 'b', '.', '.], ['a', '.', '.', '.], ['f', '.', '.', '.], ['g', 'g', '.', '.']]

Example_3:
input: [['.', '.', '.', 'b', '.], ['.', '.', '.', 'i', '.], ['.', 'a', '.', '.', '.], ['.', '.', 'd', 'd', 'd], ['.', '.', '.', 'f', 'f']]
output: [['b', '.', '.', '.', '.], ['i', '.', '.', '.', '.], ['a', '.', '.', '.', '.], ['d', 'd', 'd', '.', '.], ['f', 'f', '.', '.', '.']]

Test case:
input: [['.', '.', '.', 'h', 'h], ['.', 'b', '.', '.', '.], ['.', '.', 'i', 'i', '.], ['a', '.', 'a', '.', 'a], ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'd']]
