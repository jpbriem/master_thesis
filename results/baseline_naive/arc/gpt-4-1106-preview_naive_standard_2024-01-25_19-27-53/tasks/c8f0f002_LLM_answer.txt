Example_1:
input: [[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8], [1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]]
output: [[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8], [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 7, 7, 1], [1, 8, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 1], [1, 8, 1, 5], [5, 1, 1, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[1, 8, 1, 7, 1], [7, 8, 8, 1, 1], [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]]
output: [[1, 8, 1, 5, 1], [5, 8, 8, 1, 1], [5, 1, 8, 8, 5]]

Test case:
input: [[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]

Sample Outputs:
The examples provided appear to show a pattern where the number 7 in specific configurations is replaced by the number 5. However, without additional context or rules, it's difficult to discern the exact transformation rule applied to the input matrices. It seems that 7s that are surrounded by other 7s or are in a horizontal/vertical line of 7s are being replaced by 5s, except when a 7 is next to an 8 or at the edge of the matrix.

We can attempt to apply a similar transformation to the test case, assuming the same rule:

Original test case input:
```
[[1, 7, 7, 1, 7],
 [8, 1, 7, 7, 7],
 [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]
```

According to the assumed rule, we would change the 7s that are not adjacent to 8s (and are not on the edge of the matrix) to 5s. In this case, the 7 in the middle of the second row and the 7s in the middle of the third row would be changed:

Transformed output:
```
[[1, 7, 7, 1, 7],
 [8, 1, 5, 5, 5],
 [8, 5, 1, 5, 8]]
```

So the output for the test case would be:
```
[[1, 7, 7, 1, 7],
 [8, 1, 5, 5, 5],
 [8, 5, 1, 5, 8]]
```

Please note that this transformation is based on an interpretation of the pattern in the given examples and may not be accurate if there are additional unspecified rules or if the context requires a different interpretation.
