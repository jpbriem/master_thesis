The task is to find the cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) to a single rock and fill them with the digit '1' (let's say \"sand\"). It's important to note that we don't fill in cells adjacent to more than one rock.\n\nThe algorithm to solve this would be:\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.\n2. For each cell that is a rock (contains an '8'), check its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n3. If a neighbor is empty (contains a '0') and is adjacent to only one rock, change it to a '1'.\n4. Continue this process until you've checked all cells in the grid.\n5. Return the modified grid.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the test case input provided:\n\ninput: \n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], \n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], \n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\noutput: \n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8], \n [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0], \n [0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], \n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The cell at (0,4) is next to only one rock at (0,5).\n- The cell at (1,4) and (1,5) are each next to only one rock at (0,5) and (2,5), respectively.\n- The cells at (2,1), (3,0), and (3,1) are next to only one rock at (3,3).\n- The cells at (4,2) and (4,5) are next to the rock at (4,3) and (4,4), respectively.\n- The cell at (5,2) is next to only one rock at (5,1).\n- The cells at (6,1) and (6,0) don't have any '1' because they are adjacent to two rocks."
