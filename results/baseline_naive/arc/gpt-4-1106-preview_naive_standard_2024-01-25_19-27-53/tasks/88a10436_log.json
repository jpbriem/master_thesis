The position of the group after rotation seems to depend on its original position in the matrix. \n\nLet's analyze the given examples and attempt to deduce a pattern:\n\nExample_1:\n- A group of elements at the bottom right corner (containing the number 5) is rotated around its center and moved up and left.\n\nExample_2:\n- The top-right group (containing the number 6) is rotated and moved to the leftmost column, maintaining its row position.\n- The second group (containing the number 1s) is rotated and moved up one row, maintaining its column position.\n- The third group (containing the number 2s) is rotated and moved up two rows, maintaining its column position.\n\nExample_3:\n- The second row from the bottom (containing 2s and 3s) is rotated and moved to the second column from the left.\n- The bottom row (containing 3s and 1) is rotated and moved to the third column from the left.\n\nBased on these patterns, it seems that groups of numbers are being rotated around their center and then moved in the matrix based on their original position. However, without a clear rule or function, it's not possible to provide an exact output for a new test case. \n\nAdditionally, the examples provided do not show consistent behavior for elements that are not part of a group or single elements, so it's unclear how those should be treated.\n\nTo solve a new test case, we would need the specific rules or algorithm being applied for the rotation and movement of elements within the matrix.\n\nGiven that the rules are not provided, the test case input cannot be processed into an output. If there are specific rules or a function to apply, please provide them to proceed with the computation."
