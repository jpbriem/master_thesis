Example_1:
input: [[6, 6, 7, 6], [6, 6, 7, 7], [7, 7, 6, 7]]
output: [[2, 2, 7, 2], [2, 2, 7, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 7, 7, 6], [6, 6, 7, 6], [7, 7, 6, 7], [7, 6, 7, 7], [7, 6, 7, 6], [6, 6, 6, 7]]
output: [[7, 7, 7, 2], [2, 2, 7, 2], [7, 7, 2, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 2], [2, 2, 2, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7], [7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7]]
output: [[7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 7, 2, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7, 2, 7]]

Test case:
input: [[6, 7, 7, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7], [7, 7, 7, 6], [7, 6, 7, 6]]

Sample Outputs:
The pattern in the examples provided seems to be that the number `6` is replaced by `2` in the output. We can write a function that takes a list of lists as input and produces a new list of lists where every `6` is replaced by `2`.

Here's how it can be done in Python:

```python
def replace_six_with_two(matrix):
    return [[2 if item == 6 else item for item in row] for row in matrix]

# Test case
input_matrix = [[6, 7, 7, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7], [7, 7, 7, 6], [7, 6, 7, 6]]
output_matrix = replace_six_with_two(input_matrix)
print(output_matrix)
```

Now let's run this function with the test case provided:

```python
input_matrix = [[6, 7, 7, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7], [7, 7, 7, 6], [7, 6, 7, 6]]
output_matrix = replace_six_with_two(input_matrix)
```

The expected output would be:

```
[[2, 7, 7, 2], [2, 7, 2, 7], [7, 7, 7, 2], [7, 2, 7, 2]]
```

This output is obtained by replacing every `6` with `2` in the original `input_matrix`.
