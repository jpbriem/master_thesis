Sample Outputs:
The pattern in the examples provided seems to reflect a transformation of the input 3x3 matrix based on some specific rules. Let's analyze the pattern:

- The corners of the matrix remain unchanged.
- The center of the matrix changes to the sum of the four corner values divided by 4 (average of corners).
- The middle elements of each side (top, bottom, left, right) change to the average of the two adjacent corners plus the center value.

Using these observations, let's apply the rules to the given test case:

input: [[1, 3, 2], [3, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2]]

1. Calculate the center value as the average of corners:
   Center = (1 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 (since we're dealing with integers, if we need to round, we will assume it's rounding down to the nearest integer in this context, so 1.5 becomes 1)

2. Calculate the middle elements (top, bottom, left, right):
   - Top = (1 + 2) / 2 + 1 = 3 / 2 + 1 = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 (round down to 2)
   - Bottom = (1 + 2) / 2 + 1 = 3 / 2 + 1 = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 (round down to 2)
   - Left = (1 + 1) / 2 + 1 = 2 / 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
   - Right = (2 + 2) / 2 + 1 = 4 / 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

3. The corners remain unchanged.

Applying these rules, the output for the test case would be:

output: [[1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 3], [1, 2, 2]]

Please note that rounding behavior wasn't specified in the examples, so if rounding should be done differently (e.g., always round up or use standard rounding rules), the calculated values for the middle elements and the center might change accordingly.
