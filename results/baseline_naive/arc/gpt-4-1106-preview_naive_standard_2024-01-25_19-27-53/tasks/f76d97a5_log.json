It looks like we are replacing certain numbers with `0` and keeping others, depending on their position and value relative to their neighbors.\n\nTo determine the output, we must understand the rules applied to the input. From the examples, it seems like:\n\n1. If a number is lower than or equal to all of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right), it is replaced with `0`.\n2. If a number is greater than at least one of its neighbors, it remains unchanged.\n\nApplying these rules to the new test case:\n\ninput: [\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3],\n[3, 5, 3, 3, 3],\n[3, 5, 5, 3, 5],\n[3, 3, 3, 5, 3],\n[5, 5, 5, 3, 3]\n]\n\nLet's evaluate each number:\n\n- The `5` in the first row is greater than its left and right neighbors, so it stays.\n- The `5` in the second row is greater than its top neighbor, so it stays.\n- The `5` and `5` in the third row are greater than their top and bottom neighbors, respectively, so they stay.\n- The `5` in the fourth row is greater than its bottom neighbor, so it stays.\n- The `5` in the fifth row is greater than its top and right neighbors, so it stays.\n- The other `5`s in the fifth row are greater than their top neighbors, so they stay.\n- All other numbers are either equal to or less than their neighbors, so they are replaced with `0`.\n\noutput: [\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 5, 5, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n[5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n]\n\nThus, the output matrix after applying these rules to the test case would be:\n\n[\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n[0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 5, 5, 0, 5],\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n[5, 5, 5, 0, 0]\n]"
