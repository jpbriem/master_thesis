Example_1:
input: [[2, 2, 1], [1, 5, 1], [5, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 1, 5], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 2, 5], [6, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5]]
output: [[2, 6, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 2, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 9, 5], [5, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]
output: [[9, 5, 5], [9, 5, 8], [5, 8, 9]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 6, 6], [2, 1, 1], [2, 6, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 2]]

Test case:
input: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]

Sample Outputs:
From the examples you've provided, it appears that the operation being performed on the input matrices is a sort of column-wise sorting, where each column of the input matrix is sorted independently in ascending order. 

Given the additional test case:

input: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4], [9, 3, 4]]

We would perform the same operation. Let's sort each column:

- The first column is [9, 9, 9], which is already sorted.
- The second column is [3, 4, 3], which sorted would be [3, 3, 4].
- The third column is [4, 4, 4], which is already sorted.

So after applying the column-wise sort to the test case, the output would be:

output: [[9, 3, 4], [9, 3, 4], [9, 4, 4]]

solution: [[9, 9, 9], [3, 4, 3], [4, 4, 4]]
