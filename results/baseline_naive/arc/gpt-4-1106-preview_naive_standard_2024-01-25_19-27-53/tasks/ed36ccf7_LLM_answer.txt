Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a 3x3 matrix as input and produces another 3x3 matrix as output, in which each cell contains the maximum value found in the corresponding row or column of the input matrix. The examples provided show that if a zero is encountered, it is propagated in its row and column, but the maximum value of the non-zero elements is also propagated in the opposite direction.

Here is a Python function to achieve this:

```python
def propagate_max(matrix):
    max_in_rows = [max(row) for row in matrix]
    max_in_cols = [max(col) for col in zip(*matrix)]

    output = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]
    
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                # Propagate zero to its row and column
                max_in_rows[i] = 0
                max_in_cols[j] = 0
    
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if matrix[i][j] != 0:
                # Only propagate the maximum value if it's not being overridden by a zero
                output[i][j] = max(max_in_rows[i], max_in_cols[j])

    return output

# Test case
input_matrix = [[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]]
output_matrix = propagate_max(input_matrix)
print(output_matrix)
```

The function `propagate_max` first calculates the maximum value in each row and column and then uses this information to populate the output matrix. If a zero is found, it ensures that the corresponding maximum values in the row and column are set to zero. Finally, the maximum values are propagated to the output matrix, taking into account the updated values in case zeros have overridden them.

Now, let's run the function with the provided test case:

```python
input_matrix = [[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]]
output_matrix = propagate_max(input_matrix)
print(output_matrix)
```

Expected output (since the logic is not explicitly given, and the previous examples do not provide a clear pattern, this is an educated guess based on the provided examples):

```text
[[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]]
```

In this case, the zeros in the first row and column propagate, and the remaining values are the maximum values found in the row or column that are not overridden by zeros.
