LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]
output: [[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0]]
output: [[6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6], [6, 0, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9], [9, 9, 9]]
output: [[9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9]]

Example_4:
input: [[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 2]]
output: [[2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 0]]

Expected result: Pass

Please help me understand why this test case fails?

Answer:
The issue is that you're trying to transform a 2D array into a 3D array using the `reshape` method, but the resulting shape is not correct.

In Python, when you use the `reshape` method on a 2D array, it reshapes the array into a new shape by repeating the elements along one or more axes. In your case, you're trying to reshape the array into a 3D array with shape `(3, 3, 3)`, but the resulting array has shape `(3, 3, 1)`.

To fix the issue, you need to specify the correct shape for the reshaped array. You can do this by passing the desired shape as an argument to the `reshape` method, like this:
```
arr = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5]])
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape((3, 3, 3))
```
This will create a 3D array with shape `(3, 3, 3)` containing the original data.

Alternatively, you can use the `numpy.tile()` function to repeat the elements of the array along the third axis, like this:
```
reshaped_arr = numpy.tile(arr, (3, 3, 1))
```
This will also create a 3D array with shape `(3, 3, 3)` containing the original data.
