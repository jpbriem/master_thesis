LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]]

Example_3:
input: [[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[4, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[4, 0, 8], [4, 7, 8], [4, 7, 8]]

Explanation of the solution:
The given array is a 2D array of integers, where each element represents a value in a certain coordinate system. The task is to transform this array into another 2D array by applying a specific set of rules.

The rules for this transformation are as follows:

* For each row, if the first element is greater than or equal to the second element, then the third element should be set to the sum of the first two elements.
* If the first element is less than the second element, then the third element should be set to zero.

Using these rules, we can transform the input array into the output array. Here's how:

For the first row, since the first element (4) is greater than or equal to the second element (0), we set the third element (8) to the sum of the first two elements (4 + 0 = 8).

For the second row, since the first element (0) is less than the second element (7), we set the third element (0).

For the third row, since the first element (0) is less than the second element (7), we set the third element (0).

Therefore, the transformed array is [[4, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0]].
