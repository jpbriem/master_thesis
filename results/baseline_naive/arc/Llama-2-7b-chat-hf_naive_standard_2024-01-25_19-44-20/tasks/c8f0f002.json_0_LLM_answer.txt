LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[1, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8], [1, 1, 7, 7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 1, 7, 7, 8]]
output: [[1, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8], [1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 8]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 7, 7, 1], [1, 8, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 7]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 1], [1, 8, 1, 5], [5, 1, 1, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[1, 8, 1, 7, 1], [7, 8, 8, 1, 1], [7, 1, 8, 8, 7]]
output: [[1, 8, 1, 5, 1], [5, 8, 8, 1, 1], [5, 1, 8, 8, 5]]

Test case:
input: [[1, 7, 7, 1, 7], [8, 1, 7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1, 7, 8]]

LLM answer:

output: [[1, 6, 6, 1, 6], [8, 4, 6, 7, 8], [8, 6, 4, 7, 8]]

Explanation of the transformation pattern:
The given input array consists of three subarrays (denoted by A, B, and C) with different lengths. Each subarray has a unique combination of values from {1, 7, 8}. The goal is to transform each subarray into another subarray with the same length as the original array, while preserving the relative positions of the elements within each subarray.

To achieve this, we first sort each subarray in ascending order based on their corresponding element in the other two subarrays. Then, we iterate through each subarray and perform the following operations:

* If the current element is less than or equal to the smallest element in the other two subarrays, move it to the left position in its respective subarray.
* If the current element is greater than the largest element in the other two subarrays, move it to the right position in its respective subarray.
* Otherwise, leave the element unchanged.

After completing these operations for all elements in each subarray, we obtain the transformed output array.

Note that the transformation pattern is symmetric, meaning that if we apply the transformation to the input array in reverse order, we will get the same output array.

Solution:
[[1, 5, 5, 1, 5], [8, 1, 5, 5, 5], [8, 5, 1, 5, 8]]
