Identify the character that occurs at the corners of the input matrix.\n2. Replace all occurrences of that corner character with 'b', except for the corner cells themselves.\n3. Replace all other characters that are not at the corners with 'e'.\n\nFollowing this rule, let's apply the transformation to the test case provided:\n\ninput: [['a', 'c', 'b'], ['c', 'c', 'b'], ['a', 'c', 'b']]\n\nStep 1: Identify corner characters.\nCorners are 'a' at the top-left, 'b' at the top-right and bottom-right, and 'a' at the bottom-left. Thus, 'a' and 'b' are the corner characters.\n\nStep 2: Replace all occurrences of corner characters with 'b', except for the corners themselves.\n- Since 'a' and 'b' are corners, we don't replace the corners but replace the other 'a's and 'b's with 'b'.\n\nStep 3: Replace all other characters with 'e'.\n- The remaining 'c' characters that are not in the corners will be replaced with 'e'.\n\nApplying these steps, we get:\n\noutput: [['a', 'e', 'b'], ['e', 'e', 'b'], ['a', 'e', 'b']]\n\nHowever, the examples provided seem to show a pattern where only the character that occurs in the majority of the corner cells is replaced within the matrix. If that interpretation is correct, then the character 'b' which appears in 3 out of the 4 corners would be the one replaced in the matrix, and the transformation rule would be as follows:\n\noutput: [['a', 'e', 'b'], ['e', 'e', 'b'], ['a', 'e', 'b']]\n\nSince 'b' is the majority corner character, it is replaced with 'e' within the matrix, and all other characters are also replaced with 'e'. \n\nThe other given examples consistently show that 'a' or 'b' when they are in the majority in the corners, are kept intact, and the other characters, including 'h', are replaced with 'e'. So, the result would look like this for the test case:\n\noutput: [['a', 'e', 'b'], ['e', 'e', 'b'], ['a', 'e', 'b']]"
