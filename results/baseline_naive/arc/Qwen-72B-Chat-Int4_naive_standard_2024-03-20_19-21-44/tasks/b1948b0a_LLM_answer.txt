Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element of the input matrix and update it based on its neighbors. We'll use a nested loop to iterate through each row and column of the matrix.
For each element, we'll check if all its neighbors (horizontally or vertically) have the same value as itself. If they do, we'll replace the element with the count of neighbors that have the same value. Otherwise, we'll leave the element unchanged.
Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:
```
def count_neighbors(matrix, i, j):
    count = 0
    for x in range(i-1, i+2):
        for y in range(j-1, j+2):
            if x >= 0 and x < len(matrix) and y >= 0 and y < len(matrix[0]) and matrix[x][y] == matrix[i][j]:
                count += 1
    return count

def process_matrix(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    m = len(matrix[0])
    output = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            count = count_neighbors(matrix, i, j)
            if count == 4:
                row.append(count)
            else:
                row.append(matrix[i][j])
        output.append(row)
    return output

# Example test cases
print(process_matrix([[6, 6, 7, 6], [6, 6, 7, 7], [7, 7, 6, 7]])) # should print [[2, 2, 7, 2], [2, 2, 7, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7]]
print(process_matrix([[7, 7, 7, 6], [6, 6, 7, 6], [7, 7, 6, 7], [7, 6, 7, 7], [7, 6, 7, 6], [6, 6, 6, 7]])) # should print [[7, 7, 7, 2], [2, 2, 7, 2], [7, 7, 2, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 2], [2, 2, 2, 7]]
print(process_matrix([[7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7], [7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7]])) # should print [[7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 7, 2, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7, 2, 7]]
