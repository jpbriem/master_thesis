dictionary. Then it iterates over the matrix again and replaces any non-`9` element with its decremented value if its count is greater than `1`. The function returns the modified matrix.\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(nm), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the input matrix. This is because we need to iterate over every element in the matrix twice - once to count the elements and once to replace them. The space complexity is also O(nm) as we store the counts of each element in a dictionary.\n\nFor example:\n\nInput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1], [1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1], [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9]]\nOutput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 8, 8, 1], [8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1], [8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1], [8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1], [8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 8, 9]]"
