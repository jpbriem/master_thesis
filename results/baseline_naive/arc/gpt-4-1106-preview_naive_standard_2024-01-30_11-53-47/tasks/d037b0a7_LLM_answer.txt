Example_1:
input: [['a', 'a', 'g'], ['a', 'e', 'a'], ['d', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['a', 'a', 'g'], ['a', 'e', 'g'], ['d', 'e', 'g']]

Example_2:
input: [['a', 'c', 'a'], ['h', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['a', 'c', 'a'], ['h', 'c', 'i'], ['h', 'c', 'i']]

Example_3:
input: [['e', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'c', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['e', 'a', 'a'], ['e', 'c', 'a'], ['e', 'c', 'a']]

Test case:
input: [['e', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'h', 'a']]

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to implement a logic that replaces the 'a's in the input matrix with the non-'a' values from the same row or column. This logic should be applied from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in a way that the 'a's are replaced by the nearest non-'a' value that comes before them either in the same row or column.

Here's the step-by-step logic that we can use:

1. Iterate through each row of the matrix.
2. For each element in the row, check if it is an 'a'.
3. If it is an 'a', look for the nearest non-'a' value in the same row to the left or in the same column above.
4. Replace the 'a' with the found non-'a' value.

Let's apply this logic to the provided test case:

Input: [['e', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'h', 'a']]

Step 1: Start with the first row, no replacements needed since there are no 'a's to the left of a non-'a'.
Step 2: Move to the second row:
- The first 'a' in the second row can be replaced by 'e' from above. The row becomes ['e', 'a', 'a'].
- The second 'a' in the second row can be replaced by 'e' from above. The row becomes ['e', 'e', 'a'].
- The third 'a' in the second row can be replaced by 'i' from above. The row becomes ['e', 'e', 'i'].

Step 3: Move to the third row:
- The first 'a' in the third row can be replaced by 'e' from above. The row becomes ['e', 'h', 'a'].
- The second 'a' in the third row can be replaced by 'h' which is the nearest non-'a' value in the same row. The row becomes ['e', 'h', 'a'].
- The third 'a' in the third row can be replaced by 'i' from above. The row becomes ['e', 'h', 'i'].

Output: [['e', 'a', 'i'], ['e', 'e', 'i'], ['e', 'h', 'i']]

This output represents the transformed matrix following the given rules.
