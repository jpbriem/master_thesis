Example_1:
input: [['c', 'c', 'c'], ['c', 'b', 'i'], ['c', 'i', 'i']]
output: [['c', 'c', 'c'], ['c', 'f', 'f'], ['c', 'f', 'f']]

Example_2:
input: [['b', 'b', 'b'], ['i', 'b', 'd'], ['i', 'c', 'c']]
output: [['b', 'b', 'b'], ['f', 'b', 'f'], ['f', 'f', 'f']]

Example_3:
input: [['c', 'c', 'c'], ['i', 'i', 'c'], ['c', 'c', 'c']]
output: [['c', 'c', 'c'], ['f', 'f', 'c'], ['c', 'c', 'c']]

Example_4:
input: [['d', 'd', 'i'], ['e', 'e', 'e'], ['i', 'b', 'b']]
output: [['f', 'f', 'f'], ['e', 'e', 'e'], ['f', 'f', 'f']]

Test case:
input: [['b', 'd', 'c'], ['d', 'd', 'c'], ['b', 'd', 'c']]

Sample Outputs:
The examples you provided suggest a pattern in how the output is generated from the input. For each input matrix, it appears that all 'i' cells are converted to 'f', and all cells adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to 'c' cells are also converted to 'f'. However, 'b' cells are only converted to 'f' if they are adjacent to 'c' cells. Other cells retain their original values unless they are adjacent to 'c' cells or are 'i' themselves.

Let's apply the same logic to the test case you have provided:

input: [['b', 'd', 'c'],
         ['d', 'd', 'c'],
         ['b', 'd', 'c']]

For the given test case, the 'c' cells are at positions (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). According to the pattern:

- All 'i' cells become 'f', but there are no 'i' cells in this case.
- All cells adjacent to 'c' cells will become 'f'. This rule will apply to the cells at positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), and also to the cells at positions (1,2) itself since it's adjacent to another 'c' cell diagonally.
- 'b' cells are only changed to 'f' if they are adjacent to 'c' cells. The 'b' cells at positions (0,0) and (2,0) are not adjacent to 'c', so they will remain 'b'.

After applying these rules, the output should be:

output: [['b', 'f', 'f'],
          ['f', 'f', 'f'],
          ['b', 'f', 'f']]

So, the final output for the test case you provided would be:

[['b', 'f', 'f'], ['f', 'f', 'f'], ['b', 'f', 'f']]
