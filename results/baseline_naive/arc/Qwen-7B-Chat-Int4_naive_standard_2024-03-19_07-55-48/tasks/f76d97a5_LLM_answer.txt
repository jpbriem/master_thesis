prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
Example_1:
input: [[4, 5, 4], [5, 5, 5], [4, 5, 4]]
output: [[0, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4], [0, 4, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[5, 5, 6, 6, 6], [6, 5, 5, 6, 6], [6, 6, 5, 5, 6], [6, 6, 6, 5, 5], [5, 6, 6, 6, 5]]
output: [[6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 0, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 5, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 5, 5, 9], [9, 5, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 5, 5]]
output: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]]

Test case:
input: [[3, 3, 3, 5, 3], [3, 5, 3, 3, 3], [3, 5, 5, 3, 5], [3, 3, 3, 5, 3], [5, 5, 5, 3, 3]]

Sample Outputs:
Here is one possible solution in Python:

```python
def group_numbers(grid):
    # Create an empty list to store the grouped numbers
    groups = []
    
    # Iterate over each row of the grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        # Create a new list to store the current row's numbers
        row = []
        
        # Iterate over each number in the current row
        for j in range(len(grid[i])):
            # If the number is not already in a group, add it as a new group
            if len(groups) == 0 or groups[-1][j] != grid[i][j]:
                groups.append([grid[i][j]])
                
            else:
                # Otherwise, add the number to its existing group
                groups[-1].append(grid[i][j])
        
        # Add the current row's numbers to the groups list
        groups.append(row)
    
    # Return the groups list
    return groups
```

This function works by iterating over each row of the grid and creating a new list to store that row's numbers. It then iterates over each number in the row and checks whether it is already in a group. If it is not, it adds the number as a new group. If it is, it adds the number to its existing group.

After processing all rows, the function returns the groups list, which contains a list of lists representing the groups of numbers in the grid. Each inner list represents a group of numbers, with the first element being the minimum number in the group and the last element being the maximum number in the group.
