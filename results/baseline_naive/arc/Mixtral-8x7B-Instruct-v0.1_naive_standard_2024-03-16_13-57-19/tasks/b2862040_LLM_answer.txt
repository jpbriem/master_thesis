Comment: What is the expected output for `[[1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],...]`?

## Answer (0)

I think you can do this with a single pass through the matrix. You just need to keep track of the current maximum and minimum values in each row as well as the overall maximum value seen so far. Then when you see a new cell that's less than or equal to the current minimum, update it; if it's greater than the current max but still less than the overall max, then replace the min with the new value. If it's greater than both the current max and the overall max, then set the min to be one more than the old max and the max to be the new value. Here's some code that does what I described above:

```
def flood(matrix):
    m = len(matrix)
    n = len(matrix[0])
    mx = -1
    for i in range(m):
        rmin = rmax = matrix[i][0]
        for j in range(n):
            v = matrix[i][j]
            if v <= rmin:
                rmin = v
            elif v < rmax:
                rmax = v
            else:
                rmin = rmax + 1
                rmax = v
            mx = max(mx, rmax)
        matrix[i] = [rmin] * n
    return [[v if v > mx else mx for v in row] for row in matrix]
```

Here are your test cases using my function:
