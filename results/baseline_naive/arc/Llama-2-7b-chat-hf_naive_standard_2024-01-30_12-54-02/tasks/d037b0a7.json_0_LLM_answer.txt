LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['a', 'a', 'g'], ['a', 'e', 'a'], ['d', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['a', 'a', 'g'], ['a', 'e', 'g'], ['d', 'e', 'g']]

Example_2:
input: [['a', 'c', 'a'], ['h', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['a', 'c', 'a'], ['h', 'c', 'i'], ['h', 'c', 'i']]

Example_3:
input: [['e', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'c', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]
output: [['e', 'a', 'a'], ['e', 'c', 'a'], ['e', 'c', 'a']]

Test case:
input: [['e', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'h', 'a']]

LLM answer:

output: [['e', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'h', 'a']]

Explanation:
The given algorithm transforms a sequence of strings by applying the following operations in any order:

* Replace each element with its corresponding letter (or letters) from the next position in the sequence. For example, if the current element is "a", replace it with the next element "b".
* If the resulting string contains only one character, repeat that character until it has at least two characters. For example, if the result of the previous operation is "b", repeat "b" until it becomes ["bb"].
* Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more transformations can be applied.

For example, in Example_1, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by repeatedly replacing each element with the next element in the sequence, and repeating each character until it has at least two characters. In Example_2, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by first replacing each element with the next element in the sequence, and then repeating each character until it has at least two characters. In Example_3, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by first replacing each element with the next element in the sequence, and then repeating each character until it has at least two characters.

In Test case, the input sequence is transformed into the output sequence by applying the above operations.

Solution:
[['e', 'a', 'i'], ['e', 'a', 'i'], ['e', 'h', 'i']]
