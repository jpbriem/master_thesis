LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['c', 'c', 'b'], ['c', 'b', 'c'], ['c', 'i', 'b']]
output: [['b', 'i', 'c'], ['c', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'c', 'c']]

Example_2:
input: [['j', 'c', 'e'], ['c', 'e', 'e'], ['c', 'j', 'c']]
output: [['c', 'j', 'c'], ['e', 'e', 'c'], ['e', 'c', 'j']]

Example_3:
input: [['i', 'i', 'i'], ['f', 'f', 'i'], ['i', 'f', 'f']]
output: [['f', 'f', 'i'], ['i', 'f', 'f'], ['i', 'i', 'i']]

Example_4:
input: [['d', 'c', 'j'], ['j', 'j', 'j'], ['c', 'd', 'd']]
output: [['d', 'd', 'c'], ['j', 'j', 'j'], ['j', 'c', 'd']]

Test case:
input: [['g', 'e', 'e'], ['g', 'g', 'e'], ['e', 'g', 'h']]

LLM answer:

output: [['e', 'g', 'h'], ['g', 'g', 'e'], ['e', 'e', 'g']]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input sequence, where the order of elements in the sequence is changed while preserving their relative positions. In other words, if two elements appear at position 1 and 2 in the input sequence, they will also appear at position 1 and 2 in the output sequence. However, the order of these elements may be swapped with other elements in the sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first element ('c') appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (1, 2, and 3) in the corresponding output sequences. Similarly, the second element ('b') appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (2, 3, and 1) in the corresponding output sequences. The third element ('i') appears at position 3 in the first input sequence, but it appears at different positions (2, 3, and 1) in the corresponding output sequences.

Similarly, in Example_2, the first element ('j') appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (1, 2, and 3) in the corresponding output sequences. The second element ('c') appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (2, 3, and 1) in the corresponding output sequences. The third element ('e') appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (3, 1, and 2) in the corresponding output sequences.

In Example_3, the first element ('i') appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (1, 2, and 3) in the corresponding output sequences. The second element ('f') appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (2, 3, and 1) in the corresponding output sequences. The third element ('i') appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (3, 1, and 2) in the corresponding output sequences.

In Example_4, the first element ('d') appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (1, 2, and 3) in the corresponding output sequences. The second element ('c') appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (2, 3, and 1) in the corresponding output sequences. The third element ('j') appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (3, 1, and 2) in the corresponding output sequences.

Finally, in Test case, the first element ('g') appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (1, 2, and 3) in the corresponding output sequences. The second element ('e') appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (2, 3, and 1) in the corresponding output sequences. The third element ('h') appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions (3, 1, and 2) in the corresponding output sequences.

Solution:
[['h', 'g', 'e'], ['e', 'g', 'g'], ['e', 'e', 'g']]
