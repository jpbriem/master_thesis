LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Explanation of Example_1:
The first row is transformed into a binary matrix with zeros in all positions except for those where the value is greater than or equal to eight. This results in the second row. Then, the third row is created by setting all values that were zero in the previous step to two. Finally, the fourth row is obtained by setting all values that were zero in the previous step to one.

Explanation of Example_2:
The first row is transformed into a binary matrix with zeros in all positions except for those where the value is greater than or equal to eight. This results in the second row. Then, the third row is created by setting all values that were zero in the previous step to two. Finally, the fourth row is obtained by setting all values that were zero in the previous step to one.
