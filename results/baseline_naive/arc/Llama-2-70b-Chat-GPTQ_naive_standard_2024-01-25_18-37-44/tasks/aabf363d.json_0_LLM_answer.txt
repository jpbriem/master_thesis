LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Explanation:
The given function takes a two-dimensional array as an input and modifies it by applying the following operations:

1. Shift elements to the right: Elements in each row are shifted to the right by a certain number of positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary. The number of positions to shift is specified by the last element of the row. For example, if the last element of a row is 8, then all elements in that row are shifted 8 positions to the right.
2. Fill remaining elements with 0: After shifting elements, any empty spaces created are filled with 0.
3. Update output: The modified rows are returned as the output.
In the first example, the input array has six rows, and the last element of each row specifies the number of positions to shift. The second row has a 2 in the last position, indicating that the elements in this row should be shifted 2 positions to the right. Similarly, the fourth row has a 4 in the last position, so its elements are shifted 4 positions to the right. The resulting array after shifting and filling with 0's is displayed above.
In the second example, the input array has seven rows, and the last element of each row specifies the number of positions to shift. The third row has a 3 in the last position, indicating that the elements in this row should be shifted 3 positions to the right. The fifth row has a 5 in the last position, so its elements are shifted 5 positions to the right. The resulting array after shifting and filling with 0's is displayed above.
In the test case, the input array has seven rows, and the last element of each row specifies the number of positions to shift. The second row has an 8 in the last position, indicating that the elements in this row should be shifted 8 positions to the right. The sixth row has a 2 in the last position, so its elements are shifted 2 positions to the right. The resulting array after shifting and filling with 0's is displayed above.
