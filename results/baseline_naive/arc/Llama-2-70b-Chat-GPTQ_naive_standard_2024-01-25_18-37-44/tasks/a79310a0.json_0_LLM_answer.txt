LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

LLM answer:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

The transformation is a bit tricky to understand at first but once you see it in action, it becomes clear. The idea is that each row of the input matrix represents a "layer" of some kind (like a layer of water or a layer of soil) and each element in the row represents how much of something (water, soil, etc.) is present in that layer.

The output matrix shows how this changes after some operation has been performed on the layers. For example, if we have two layers with some amount of water in them and we add another layer with twice as much water, then the resulting matrix will have twice as much water overall because the new layer has doubled the amount of water in the previous layers.

In summary, each row of the input matrix represents a layer with some amount of something (water, soil, etc.), and each element in the row represents how much of that thing is present in that layer. The output matrix shows how this changes when a new layer is added with a certain amount of the same thing.

Solution:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
