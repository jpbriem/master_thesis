LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['c', 'c', '.'], ['.', 'c', '.'], ['c', '.', 'c']]
output: [['h', 'h', '.'], ['.', 'h', '.'], ['c', '.', 'c']]

Example_2:
input: [['.', 'c', '.', '.', '.', 'c'], ['.', 'c', 'c', 'c', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'c', '.'], ['.', 'c', '.', '.', '.', '.']]
output: [['.', 'h', '.', '.', '.', 'c'], ['.', 'h', 'h', 'h', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'c', '.'], ['.', 'c', '.', '.', '.', '.']]

Example_3:
input: [['c', 'c', '.', 'c'], ['c', 'c', '.', '.'], ['c', '.', '.', 'c'], ['.', '.', 'c', 'c']]
output: [['h', 'h', '.', 'c'], ['h', 'h', '.', '.'], ['h', '.', '.', 'h'], ['.', '.', 'h', 'h']]

Example_4:
input: [['c', 'c', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'c', '.', '.', 'c', '.'], ['c', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'c', 'c', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'c', 'c', '.', '.', 'c']]
output: [['h', 'h', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'h', '.', '.', 'c', '.'], ['c', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', 'c']]

Test case:
input: [['c', '.', 'c', '.', 'c'], ['c', 'c', 'c', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'c'], ['.', 'c', 'c', '.', '.'], ['.', 'c', 'c', '.', '.']]

LLM answer:

output: [['h', 'h', '.', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', '.', '.', '.', 'c'], ['.', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', '.'], ['.', 'h', 'h', '.', '.', 'c']]

The output of each example is a sequence of strings, where each string represents a word in the transformed text. In this problem, we assume that words are separated by spaces.
