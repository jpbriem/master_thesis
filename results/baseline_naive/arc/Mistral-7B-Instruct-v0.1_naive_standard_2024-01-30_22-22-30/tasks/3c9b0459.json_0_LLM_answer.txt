LLM prompt:
The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [['b', 'b', 'a'], ['b', 'a', 'b'], ['b', 'h', 'a']]
output: [['a', 'h', 'b'], ['b', 'a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'b']]

Example_2:
input: [['i', 'b', 'd'], ['b', 'd', 'd'], ['b', 'i', 'b']]
output: [['b', 'i', 'b'], ['d', 'd', 'b'], ['d', 'b', 'i']]

Example_3:
input: [['h', 'h', 'h'], ['e', 'e', 'h'], ['h', 'e', 'e']]
output: [['e', 'e', 'h'], ['h', 'e', 'e'], ['h', 'h', 'h']]

Example_4:
input: [['c', 'b', 'i'], ['i', 'i', 'i'], ['b', 'c', 'c']]
output: [['c', 'c', 'b'], ['i', 'i', 'i'], ['i', 'b', 'c']]

Test case:
input: [['f', 'd', 'd'], ['f', 'f', 'd'], ['d', 'f', 'g']]

LLM answer:

output: [['f', 'f', 'd'], ['d', 'f', 'g'], ['f', 'd', 'd']]

The output of each example is obtained by applying a permutation to the input sequence, where the order of elements in the sequence is changed while preserving their relative positions. In other words, if two elements appear at position 1 and 2 in the input sequence, they will also appear at position 1 and 2 in the output sequence. However, the order of these elements may be swapped with other elements in the sequence.

For example, in Example_1, the first element 'b' appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 1, position 2, and position 3). Similarly, the second element 'a' appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 2, position 3, and position 1). Finally, the third element 'h' appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 3, position 1, and position 2).

Similarly, in Example_2, the first element 'i' appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 1, position 3, and position 2). Similarly, the second element 'b' appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 2, position 1, and position 3). Finally, the third element 'd' appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 3, position 2, and position 1).

In Example_3, the first element 'h' appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 1, position 2, and position 3). Similarly, the second element 'e' appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 2, position 1, and position 3). Finally, the third element 'h' appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 3, position 1, and position 2).

In Example_4, the first element 'c' appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 1, position 3, and position 2). Similarly, the second element 'b' appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 2, position 1, and position 3). Finally, the third element 'i' appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 3, position 2, and position 1).

Finally, in Test case, the first element 'f' appears at position 1 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 1, position 2, and position 3). Similarly, the second element 'd' appears at position 2 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 2, position 3, and position 1). Finally, the third element 'g' appears at position 3 in all three input sequences, but it appears at different positions in the corresponding output sequences (position 3, position 1, and position 2).

Solution:
