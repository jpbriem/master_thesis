LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is to reverse the order of the letters in each row to get the output. So, if the input is "a, b, c", the output would be "c, b, a".

Applying this pattern to the final test input, we get:

Test input: a, a, a
c, a, a
c, a, a

Using the reversal pattern, the output should be:

Test output: a, a, a
c, a, a
c, a, a

So, the final answer is "a, a, a".
