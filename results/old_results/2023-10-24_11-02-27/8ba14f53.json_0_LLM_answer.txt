LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's start by analyzing the patterns in the training data.

From the first few examples, we can see that the pattern involves replacing each letter in the input with the corresponding letter three positions ahead of it in the alphabet (modulo 26). For example, the input "a" becomes "e", the input "e" becomes "a", and so on.

We can also observe that the pattern repeats every four letters, with the last letter of the input becoming the first letter of the next input.

Using this information, we can try applying the pattern to the test input "e, e, e, a, a, a, h, h, h". Here's how we would translate each letter:

* "e" becomes "a" (position 0)
* "e" becomes "a" (position 1)
* "e" becomes "a" (position 2)
* "a" becomes "e" (position 3)
* "a" becomes "a" (position 4)
* "a" becomes "h" (position 5)
* "h" becomes "h" (position 6)
* "h" becomes "h" (position 7)

So, the translated test input is "a, a, a, a, e, a, a, h".

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to continue working on the puzzle!
