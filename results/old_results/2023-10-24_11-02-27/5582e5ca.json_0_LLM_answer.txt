LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
e, e, i
g, e, d
g, d, a
train output:
e, e, e
e, e, e
e, e, e
End of example.
train input:
g, i, j
b, i, b
j, e, j
train output:
j, j, j
j, j, j
j, j, j
End of example.
train input:
e, g, j
g, e, b
i, i, g
train output:
g, g, g
g, g, g
g, g, g
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is to shift each row of letters by one position to the right, while maintaining the order of the letters within each row.

Here's how it works:

1. If the first letter of the input row is 'e', then the output row will have three 'e's in a row.
2. If the first letter of the input row is any other letter, then the output row will have the same letter repeated three times in a row.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input: i, i, g
e, g, j
i, d, a

Step 1: Shift the first row (i) to the right by one position:
i, i, g

Step 2: Shift the second row (e, g, j) to the right by one position:
e, g, j

Step 3: Shift the third row (i, d, a) to the right by one position:
i, d, a

Therefore, the test output is:
g, g, g

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle.
