LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle by identifying the step-by-step pattern in the training examples and applying it to the test input.

From the first training example:

* Step 1: Replace every 'j' with 'f'. (j -> f)
* Step 2: Replace every 'f' with 'j'. (f -> j)

Applying these steps to the test input gives us:

e, e, j, j
e, e, e, e
e, e, j, j

So the test output is also "j, j, j, j".

Now let's move on to the second training example:

From the second training example:

* Step 1: Replace every 'b' with 'e'. (b -> e)
* Step 2: Replace every 'e' with 'b'. (e -> b)

Applying these steps to the test input gives us:

e, e, e, e
e, e, b, b
e, e, e, e

So the test output is also "e, e, b, b".

Moving on to the third training example:

From the third training example:

* Step 1: Replace every 'j' with 'e'. (j -> e)
* Step 2: Replace every 'e' with 'j'. (e -> j)

Applying these steps to the test input gives us:

e, e, e, e
e, e, j, j
e, e, e, e

So the test output is also "e, e, e, e".

Finally, let's apply the same steps to the fourth training example:

From the fourth training example:

* Step 1: Replace every 'd' with 'f'. (d -> f)
* Step 2: Replace every 'f' with 'd'. (f -> d)

Applying these steps to the test input gives us:

f, f, f, f
f, f, d, d
f, f, f, f

So the test output is also "f, f, d, d".

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for solving this puzzle is:

1. Replace every 'j' with 'f'.
2. Replace every 'f' with 'j'.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until no more changes can be made.

By following this pattern, we can solve any input provided in the puzzle.
