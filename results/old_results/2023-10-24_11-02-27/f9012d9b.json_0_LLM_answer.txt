LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with three sets of input and output pairs for different patterns. Here are my observations and solutions for each set:

Set 1:
Inputs: `c, b, c, b, c`, `b, b, b, b, b`
Outputs: `b, b`

Explanation: In this set, we have two inputs that consist of alternating characters 'c' and 'b'. The output for both inputs is the same, which is also 'b, b'. Therefore, the pattern appears to be simply repeating the input twice.

Solution: For the final test input, if we repeat the input `i, b, i, i, a, a, a` twice, the output should be `a, a`.

Set 2:
Inputs: `i, g, a, g`, `g, i, g, i`
Outputs: `i`

Explanation: In this set, we have two inputs that consist of alternating characters 'i', 'g', and 'a'. The output for both inputs is the same, which is also just 'i'. Therefore, the pattern appears to be simply repeating the input without any transformation.

Solution: For the final test input, if we repeat the input `i, b, i, i, a, a, a` once, the output should be `i`.

Set 3:
Inputs: `c, c, f, c, c, f, c`, `c, c, f, c, c, f, c`, `f, f, f, f, f, f, f`
Outputs: `f, f`

Explanation: In this set, we have three inputs that consist of alternating characters 'c', 'f', and 'b'. The output for each input is the same, which is also just 'f, f'. Therefore, the pattern appears to be simply repeating the input without any transformation.

Solution: For the final test input, if we repeat the input `i, b, i, i, a, a, a` thrice, the output should be `f, f`.

I hope these solutions are correct! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
