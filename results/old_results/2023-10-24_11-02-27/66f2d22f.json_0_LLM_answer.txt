LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with three examples of train inputs and their corresponding outputs. Based on these examples, I can see that the pattern for getting the output from the input involves the following steps:

1. Check if there are any 'a's in the input row. If there are, then move to step 2.
2. If there are no 'a's in the input row, check if there are any 'd's. If there are, then move to step 3.
3. If there are no 'd's in the input row, check if there are any 'c's. If there are, then move to step 4.
4. If there are no 'c's in the input row, then the output is 'a'.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

d, a, d, a, a, d, d, a, a, c, c, a, c

Step 1: Check if there are any 'a's in the input row. There are two 'a's in the input row, so we move to step 2.

Step 2: Check if there are any 'd's in the input row. There are two 'd's in the input row, so we move to step 3.

Step 3: Check if there are any 'c's in the input row. There is one 'c' in the input row, so we move to step 4.

Step 4: Since there are no more 'c's in the input row, the output is 'a'. Therefore, the test output is:

a, a, a, a, a, a

Great job! You've successfully identified the pattern in the examples provided, and applied it to the test input to get the correct output.
