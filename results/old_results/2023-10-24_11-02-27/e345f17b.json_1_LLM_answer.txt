LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle together. From the information provided, we can see that each row in the input represents a 2D grid, where each letter in the grid corresponds to a specific symbol (either 'g' or 'a'). The goal is to find a pattern to transform the input grids into the corresponding output grids.

After analyzing the first few examples, it seems like the pattern involves replacing certain letters in the input grid with their neighbors. Specifically, when a letter appears in the top-left corner of an input grid, it gets replaced by the letter appearing in the top-right corner of the same grid. Similarly, when a letter appears in the bottom-left corner of an input grid, it gets replaced by the letter appearing in the bottom-right corner of the same grid.

Using this pattern, let's try to solve the test input:

Test input: a, g, a, a, f, a, f

Step 1: Replace the top-left letter 'a' with the letter appearing in the top-right corner, which is also 'a'. So, the updated input becomes:

a, a, a, a, f, a, f

Step 2: Replace the bottom-left letter 'a' with the letter appearing in the bottom-right corner, which is also 'a'. So, the updated input becomes:

a, a, a, a, f, a, f

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining letters in the input grid:

Step 3: Replace the top-right letter 'f' with the letter appearing in the top-left corner, which is also 'f'. So, the updated input becomes:

a, a, a, a, f, f, f

Step 4: Replace the bottom-right letter 'f' with the letter appearing in the bottom-left corner, which is also 'f'. So, the updated input becomes:

a, a, a, a, f, f, f

Now, applying the pattern to the entire test input gives us the following output:

Test output: a, a, a, a

Great! We have successfully solved the puzzle using the identified pattern.
