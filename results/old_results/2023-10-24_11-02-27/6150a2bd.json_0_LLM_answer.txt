LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
d, d, i
d, h, a
f, a, a
train output:
a, a, f
a, h, d
i, d, d
End of example.
train input:
f, f, c
b, a, a
a, a, a
train output:
a, a, a
a, a, b
c, f, f
End of example.
test input:
g, d, f
g, i, a
e, a, a
test output:[/INST]

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:

Training Example 1:
The pattern in this example is:

* If the top two letters are the same, then the bottom letter will be the opposite of the top letter (i.e., if the top letter is "d", the bottom letter will be "a").
* If the top two letters are different, then the bottom letter will be the same as the top letter (i.e., if the top letter is "d", the bottom letter will also be "d").

Using this pattern, we can generate the output for the test input:

Test Input: g, d, f
Output: a, a, f

Training Example 2:
The pattern in this example is:

* If the first letter is "f", then the second letter will be the opposite of the first letter (i.e., if the first letter is "f", the second letter will be "a").
* If the first letter is not "f", then the second letter will be the same as the first letter (i.e., if the first letter is "d", the second letter will also be "d").

Using this pattern, we can generate the output for the test input:

Test Input: g, d, f
Output: a, a, f

So, based on these patterns, the output for the test input is "a, a, f".
