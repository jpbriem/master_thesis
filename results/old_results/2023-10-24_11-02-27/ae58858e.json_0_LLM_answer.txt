LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a set of examples that demonstrate the pattern for solving these types of puzzles. Here's how you can use this pattern to solve the test input:

1. Start by applying the pattern to the first row of the test input:

a, a, a, a, c, c, c

The pattern tells us to replace each letter in the input with the corresponding letter in the output, so we get:

a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> c (replaced by the second "c" in the output)
c -> c (unchanged)
c -> c (unchanged)

So the result of applying the pattern to the first row of the test input is:

a, a, a, a, c, c, c

2. Now, apply the pattern to the second row of the test input:

c, c, a, a, a, a, a

Using the same process as before, we get:

c -> c (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)

So the result of applying the pattern to the second row of the test input is:

c, c, a, a, a, a, a

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining rows of the test input, using the resulting outputs as the new input for the next row.

Here are the results of applying the pattern to the entire test input:

a, a, a, a, c, c, c
c, c, a, a, a, a, a
a, c, c, a, a, c, c
a, a, a, a, a, a, a
c, a, c, c, a, a, c

The final output for the test input is:

a, a, a, a, c, c, c

Great job! By following the pattern and applying it to the test input, you were able to correctly solve the puzzle and obtain the correct output.
