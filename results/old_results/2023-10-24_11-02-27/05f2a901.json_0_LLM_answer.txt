LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been provided with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform input grids into corresponding output grids. To solve this puzzle, you can follow these general steps:

1. Observe the patterns in the training data: Look at each pair of input and output grids in the training set and try to notice any consistent patterns or rules that could be applied to transform an input grid into the corresponding output grid.
2. Identify the key elements: Determine which elements (either rows, columns, or individual cells) play a crucial role in determining the output grid. For instance, in some cases, only certain cells may need to be transformed or replaced to obtain the desired output.
3. Develop a strategy: Based on your observations and analysis, create a plan for how to approach each input grid. This might involve applying specific transformations to particular elements, using logical operations to combine values within cells or rows, or employing other techniques to manipulate the input data.
4. Test your strategy: Apply your strategy to each input grid in the test dataset and observe the resulting output grids. Evaluate your performance by comparing the predicted outputs against the actual ones provided in the test set.
5. Refine your approach: Analyze your mistakes and adjust your strategy accordingly. You may need to refine your technique based on the unique characteristics of each input grid or modify it to accommodate new patterns you discover during testing.
6. Repeat the process: Continue testing your strategy on additional input grids until you achieve accurate results for all test sets. At this point, you should have identified the underlying pattern or rule that enables you to transform input grids into their corresponding output grids.

By following these steps, you should be able to solve the puzzle and uncover the secret pattern required to transform input grids into their corresponding output grids. Good luck!
