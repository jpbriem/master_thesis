LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's start by analyzing the patterns in the training examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply replacing each letter in the input with the corresponding letter three positions ahead ( wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary). For example, "a" becomes "a", "b" becomes "e", etc. Applying this pattern to the test input gives us:

Output: c, a, a, h, i

2. Second example:
This pattern seems to involve swapping adjacent letters in the input. For example, "c" becomes "d", "b" becomes "a", etc. Using this pattern on the test input gives us:

Output: d, b, a, a, h, i

3. Third example:
The pattern here involves replacing each letter in the input with the next letter in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. For example, "a" becomes "b", "b" becomes "c", etc. Using this pattern on the test input gives us:

Output: a, b, c, a, a, h, i

Now that we have identified the patterns for each example, let's apply them to the final test input:

Test input: c, a, a, h, i

Using the first pattern, we get:

Output: c, a, a, h, i

Using the second pattern, we get:

Output: d, b, a, a, h, i

And using the third pattern, we get:

Output: a, b, c, a, a, h, i

Therefore, the final output for the test input is:

Output: a, b, c, a, a, h, i

Solution:
c, c, a, a, a, a, h, h, i, i
c, c, a, a, a, a, h, h, i, i
c, c, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a
c, c, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a
a, a, f, f, g, g, g, g, a, a
a, a, f, f, g, g, g, g, a, a
d, d, f, f, g, g, a, a, a, a
d, d, f, f, g, g, a, a, a, a
a, a, f, f, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, f, f, a, a, a, a, a, a
