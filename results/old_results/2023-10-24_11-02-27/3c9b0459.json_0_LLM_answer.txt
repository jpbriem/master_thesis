LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
c, c, b
c, b, c
c, i, b
train output:
b, i, c
c, b, c
b, c, c
End of example.
train input:
j, c, e
c, e, e
c, j, c
train output:
c, j, c
e, e, c
e, c, j
End of example.
train input:

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply replacing each letter in the input with the next letter in the alphabet (ignoring any duplicates). So, if we start with the input "c", we replace it with "d", then "e", then "f", and so on. Therefore, the output for the given input would be "b, i, c".
2. Second example:
This one is a bit more complex. We need to count the number of times each letter appears in the input, and use that information to determine the corresponding output letter. For example, since there are two "c"s in the input, we should have two "c"s in the output. Similarly, there is one "j" in the input, so there should be one "j" in the output. Finally, there are three "e"s in the input, so there should be three "e"s in the output. Therefore, the output for this input would be "c, j, c, e, e, e".
3. Third example:
Again, we can simply replace each letter in the input with the next letter in the alphabet (ignoring any duplicates). So, if we start with the input "i", we replace it with "j", then "k", then "l", and so on. Therefore, the output for the given input would be "f, f, i".
4. Fourth example:
This time, we need to count the number of times each letter appears in the input, and use that information to determine the corresponding output letter. For example, there are two "d"s in the input, so there should be two "d"s in the output. There is one "c" in the input, so there should be one "c" in the output. And finally, there are two "j"s in the input, so there should be two "j"s in the output. Therefore, the output for this input would be "d, d, c, j, j".

Now, let's apply these patterns to the final test input:

Test input: "g, e, e"

Using the first pattern, we get: "g, e, e -> b, i, c"

Using the second pattern, we get: "g, e, e -> c, j, c, e, e, e"

So, the output for the test input is either "b, i, c" or "c, j, c, e, e, e".
