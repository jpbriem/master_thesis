LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have provided me with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. I will now use the steps you outlined to solve the puzzle and obtain the output for the given test input. Here's how I approached it:

1. Identified the repeating pattern in the input: The input consists of alternating rows of "a" and "c".
2. Applied the pattern to the test input: Starting from the first row of the test input, I alternated between "a" and "c" until I reached the end of the line.
3. Obtained the output: Based on the pattern applied to the test input, the output is also a sequence of alternating "a" and "c".

Here's the result:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Test output: c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c

As expected, the output matches the pattern applied to the test input.
