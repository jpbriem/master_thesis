LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down each example and identify the pattern behind the output for each one:

Example 1:

* Input: i, j, i
* Output: e, e, e

Pattern: Each row has the same letter (i) repeated three times. Therefore, the output will also have the letter "e" repeated three times.

Applied to the test input:

* Test input: f, e, e
* Expected output: f, f, f

Example 2:

* Input: b, f, f
* Output: d, d, d

Pattern: Each column has the same letter (f). Therefore, the output will also have the letter "d" repeated three times.

Applied to the test input:

* Test input: b, e, e
* Expected output: b, b, b

Example 3:

* Input: c, c, c
* Output: i, i, i

Pattern: Each row has the same letter (c). Therefore, the output will also have the letter "i" repeated three times.

Applied to the test input:

* Test input: f, f, f
* Expected output: f, f, f

Example 4:

* Input: h, h, h
* Output: h, h, h

Pattern: Each row has the same letter (h). Therefore, the output will also have the letter "h" repeated three times.

Applied to the test input:

* Test input: b, b, b
* Expected output: b, b, b

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test input: f, e, e

Using the first example's pattern, we expect the output to be:

f, f, f

Did I solve it correctly?
