LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle together. Based on the provided examples, it seems like the pattern involves replacing each letter in the input with the letter that appears three positions ahead of it in the alphabet.

Here's how we can apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: `a, a, a, a, a, j, a, a`

1. Replace the first `a` with the letter three positions ahead of it in the alphabet, which is `e`. So, the updated input becomes `e, a, a, a, a, j, a, a`.
2. Replace the second `a` with the letter three positions ahead of it in the alphabet, which is `o`. So, the updated input becomes `e, o, a, a, a, j, a, a`.
3. Continue this process for each `a` in the input, replacing it with the letter three positions ahead of it in the alphabet.

The resulting output for the test input would be:
```
h, e, o, j, a, a, a
```
Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle.
