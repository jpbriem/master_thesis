LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been provided with a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you've observed in the examples, I can suggest a general approach to solving this type of puzzles:

1. Identify the repeating pattern: In each example, there is a repeating pattern of letters that appears multiple times. For instance, in the first example, the pattern is "a, a, a". Try to find such patterns in the input and output pairs.
2. Use the pattern to fill in the missing letters: Once you identify a repeating pattern, try to use it to fill in the missing letters in the input or output pairs. For example, if the pattern is "a, a, a", and you see the letter "a" three times in an input pair, you can fill in the remaining two "a"s based on the pattern.
3. Apply the pattern to the test input: Finally, use the same approach to solve the test input by identifying the repeating pattern and filling in the missing letters.

Here's how you can apply these steps to the test input:

Test input: a, a, a, c, c, a

Step 1: Identify the repeating pattern - In this case, the pattern is "a, a, a".

Step 2: Use the pattern to fill in the missing letters - Since we know the pattern is "a, a, a", we can fill in the missing letters in the input as follows:

a, a, a, c, c, a = a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Step 3: Apply the pattern to the test input - Using the same approach, we can fill in the remaining letters in the test input as follows:

a, a, a, c, c, a = a, a, a, a, a, a, b

The test output is therefore "b, a, b".
