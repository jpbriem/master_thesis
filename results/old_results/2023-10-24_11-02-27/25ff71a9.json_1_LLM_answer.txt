LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
b, b, b
a, a, a
a, a, a
train output:
a, a, a
b, b, b
a, a, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is to reverse the order of the letters in each row to get the corresponding output.

Here's how it works:

1. For each row in the input, reverse the order of the letters (e.g., "a" becomes "a", "b" becomes "b", etc.).
2. The resulting row is the output.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input:
a, a, a
a, b, a
a, a, a

Applying the pattern:

Output:
a, a, a
a, b, a
a, a, a

So the test output is also "a, a, a".

Solution:
a, a, a
a, a, a
a, b, a
