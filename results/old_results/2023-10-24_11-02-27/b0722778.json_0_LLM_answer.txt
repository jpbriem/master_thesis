LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve the first training example:

Input: `c, e, a, f, i, a, a, c, e`
Output: `f, i`

To understand the pattern, let's analyze each row of the input:

1. `c`: Count the number of 'a's in this row - 1.
2. `e`: Find the number of 'a's in this row - 1.
3. `a`: Count the number of 'f's in this row - 1.
4. `f`: Find the number of 'i's in this row - 1.
5. `i`: Count the number of 'a's in this row - 1.
6. `a`: Count the number of 'c's in this row - 1.
7. `c`: Find the number of 'e's in this row - 1.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test Input: `b, b, a, b, b, a, a, e, e`

1. `b`: Count the number of 'a's in this row - 1.
2. `b`: Find the number of 'a's in this row - 1.
3. `a`: Count the number of 'e's in this row - 1.
4. `e`: Find the number of 'e's in this row - 1.

The output for the test input is `e, e`.

Let me now explain the pattern behind these examples. In both cases, we are counting the number of occurrences of certain letters (or patterns) in each row of the input, and then using those counts to determine the output letter.

In the first training example, we count the number of 'a's, 'c's, and 'e's in each row, and use those counts to determine the output letter. For instance, because there are more 'a's than 'c's in the second row, the output letter is `i`.

In the test input, we again count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'e's in each row, and use those counts to determine the output letter. For instance, because there are more 'e's than 'a's in the third row, the output letter is `e`.

I hope this helps you understand the pattern behind these examples! Do you have any questions or would you like to try solving another example?
