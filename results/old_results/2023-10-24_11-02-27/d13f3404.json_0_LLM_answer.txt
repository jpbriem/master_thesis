LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

a, d, g, b, a, a
a, a, d, g, b, a
a, a, a, d, g, b

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down each example and identify the pattern behind the transformations.

Example 1:

* Input: `g, b, a`
* Output: `g, b, a, a, a, a`

The pattern here is that for every letter in the input, if it appears more than once, replace it with an additional copy of itself. For example, `g` appears twice in the input, so the output has two `g`s. Similarly, `b` appears once in the input, so the output has one `b`.

Applying this pattern to the test input `a, a, d`, we get `a, a, d, a, a, d`.

Example 2:

* Input: `a, e, a`
* Output: `a, e, a, a, a`

The pattern here is similar to the first example, but with a twist. For every letter in the input, if it appears more than once, replace it with an additional copy of itself, except for the last letter. For example, `e` appears twice in the input, so the output has two `e`s. However, since there is only one `a` in the input, the output has only one `a`.

Applying this pattern to the test input `a, a, j`, we get `a, a, j, a, a, j`.

Example 3:

* Input: `a, a, g`
* Output: `a, a, g, a, a, g`

The pattern here is again similar to the previous examples, but with an added twist. For every letter in the input, if it appears more than once, replace it with an additional copy of itself, except for the last letter. Additionally, if the last letter is `g`, replace it with another `g`. For example, `g` appears twice in the input, so the output has two `g`s. Since the last letter is also `g`, the output has an extra `g` at the end.

Applying this pattern to the test input `a, a, k`, we get `a, a, k, a, a, k`.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle!
