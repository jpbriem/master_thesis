LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's start by analyzing the patterns in the training examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply replacing each letter in the input with the corresponding letter one position ahead in the alphabet (modulo z). So, if the input is "a", the output is "i". If the input is "i", the output is also "i".
2. Second example:
In this case, we have a more complex pattern. Each letter in the input is replaced by the letter that comes before it in the alphabet (modulo z), except for the last letter which is replaced by the letter that comes after it in the alphabet (modulo z). For example, the input "c" becomes "c", but the input "c" becomes "a".
3. Third example:
Here, we have another simple replacement pattern, where each letter in the input is replaced by the letter that comes after it in the alphabet (modulo z).
4. Fourth example:
This time, we have a combination of two patterns. The first three letters in the input are replaced using the pattern from the second example, while the last two letters are replaced using the pattern from the third example.
5. Fifth example:
Again, we see a combination of two patterns. This time, the first four letters in the input are replaced using the pattern from the fourth example, while the last two letters are replaced using the pattern from the third example.
6. Sixth example:
In this case, we have a single pattern that replaces each letter in the input with the letter that comes after it in the alphabet (modulo z).

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test input: "a, a, a, a, b, b"

Using the pattern from the first example, the output for the first letter "a" is "i". The output for the second "a" is also "i". For the letter "b", we use the pattern from the fifth example, which gives us "d". Therefore, the output for the test input is "i, i, d".
