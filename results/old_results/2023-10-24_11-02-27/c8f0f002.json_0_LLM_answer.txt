LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the training examples and use them to solve the test input.

Training Example 1:
Input: b, i, i, h, h, i
Output: b, i, i, f, f, i

Pattern Observations:

1. Each letter in the input sequence is replaced by the corresponding letter three positions ahead in the alphabet (e.g., "i" becomes "k", "h" becomes "j").
2. The pattern repeats for each row in the input sequence.

Using these observations, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

Test Input: b, h, h, b, h, i

Step 1: Replace each letter in the input sequence with the corresponding letter three positions ahead in the alphabet.

Input: b -> k, h -> j, h -> j, b -> k, h -> j, i -> l

Step 2: Repeat Step 1 for each row in the input sequence.

Output: k, j, j, k, j, l

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is "kjjkl".

Training Example 2:
Input: h, h, h, b, b, h
Output: f, f, f, b, b, f

Pattern Observations:

1. Each letter in the input sequence is replaced by the corresponding letter two positions ahead in the alphabet (e.g., "h" becomes "g", "b" becomes "a").
2. The pattern repeats for each row in the input sequence.

Using these observations, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

Test Input: h, h, h, b, b, h

Step 1: Replace each letter in the input sequence with the corresponding letter two positions ahead in the alphabet.

Input: h -> g, h -> g, h -> g, b -> a, b -> a, h -> g

Step 2: Repeat Step 1 for each row in the input sequence.

Output: gggag

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is "gggag".

Training Example 3:
Input: b, i, b, h, b, i
Output: b, i, b, f, b, i

Pattern Observations:

1. Each letter in the input sequence is replaced by the corresponding letter one position ahead in the alphabet (e.g., "i" becomes "h", "h" becomes "g").
2. The pattern repeats for each row in the input sequence.

Using these observations, we can generate the output for the test input as follows:

Test Input: b, h, h, b, h, i

Step 1: Replace each letter in the input sequence with the corresponding letter one position ahead in the alphabet.

Input: b -> g, h -> g, h -> g, b -> g, h -> g, i -> h

Step 2: Repeat Step 1 for each row in the input sequence.

Output: ghghghi

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is "ghghghi".

I hope this helps you understand the pattern in the examples and solve more complex puzzles!
