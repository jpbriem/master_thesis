LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is as follows:

1. Each row of the input grid contains exactly two distinct letters (except for the first row, which has only one letter).
2. The second letter in each row is always different from the first letter.
3. The third letter in each row is always the same as the second letter.
4. The output letter is always the last letter in the input row.

Using these rules, we can solve the test input as follows:

Test input: a, i, a

Step 1: Identify the distinct letters in each row:

Row 1: a
Row 2: i
Row 3: a

Step 2: Find the difference between the first and second letters in each row:

Row 1: a - a = 0
Row 2: i - a = 1
Row 3: a - a = 0

Step 3: Find the common letter between the second and third letters in each row:

Row 1: a
Row 2: i
Row 3: a

Step 4: Get the output letter by looking at the last letter in each row:

Output: g

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is "g".
