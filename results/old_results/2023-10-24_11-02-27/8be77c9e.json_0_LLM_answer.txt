LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
b, b, a
b, b, b
a, a, a
train output:
b, b, a
b, b, b
a, a, a
a, a, a
b, b, b
b, b, a
End of example.
train input:
a, a, a
b, a, b
b, b, a
train output:
a, a, a
b, a, b
b, b, a
b, b, a
b, a, b
a, a, a
End of example.
train input:
a, a, a
a, a, b
a, a, b
train output:
a, a, a
a, a, b
a, a, b
a, a, b
a, a, b
a, a, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is simple substitution. Each row of the input represents a 2D grid, where each letter in the grid corresponds to a specific symbol (either 'a' or 'b'). The goal is to find the correct sequence of symbols to replace each letter in the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid.

Here's how the pattern works:

1. Start by replacing every 'a' in the input grid with an 'b'. This will give you the first row of the output grid.
2. Next, replace every 'b' in the input grid with an 'a'. This will give you the second row of the output grid.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you have replaced all the letters in the input grid with their corresponding symbols. This will give you the complete output grid.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input: a, a, a
a, a, b
b, a, a

Applying the pattern:

Output grid:
a, a, a
a, a, b
b, a, a

As expected, the output grid matches the test input.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
