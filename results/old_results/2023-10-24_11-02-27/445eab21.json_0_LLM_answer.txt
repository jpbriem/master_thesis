LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle together. Based on the provided examples, we can observe that each row of the input represents a different letter (or symbol), and each column represents a different position on the grid. Additionally, the output for each input row is always the same letter or symbol as the first letter of the corresponding input row.

Using these observations, we can create a simple algorithm to solve the puzzle:

1. For each input row, find the first letter of the row (which will be the same for all rows). This letter will be our "key" for solving the puzzle.
2. For each input cell, check if it matches the key letter. If it does, write the corresponding output letter next to the cell. Otherwise, leave the cell blank.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all cells in the grid.

Let's apply this algorithm to the test input:

Test input: `d, d, d, d, a, j, j, j, j`

Step 1: Find the key letter for the first input row. Since the first letter of the row is 'd', our key letter is 'd'.

Step 2: Check each cell in the input row against the key letter. Since the first cell has the letter 'd', we write 'j' next to it (since 'j' is the output for the key letter 'd'). The second cell has the letter 'd' again, so we write 'j' next to it too.

Step 3: Move on to the next input row. Since the second row has the letter 'a' as its first letter, our key letter is now 'a'. We check each cell in the row against the key letter, and since the first cell has the letter 'a', we write 'j' next to it. The second cell has the letter 'a' again, so we write 'j' next to it too.

Repeat this process for all input rows and cells, using the key letter for each row as the basis for writing the output letters.

The resulting output for the test input is:

`j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j`

Great! We have successfully solved the puzzle using the provided examples.
