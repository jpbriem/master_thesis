LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, a, g
a, e, a
d, a, a
train output:
a, a, g
a, e, g
d, e, g
End of example.
train input:
a, c, a
h, a, i
a, a, a
train output:
a, c, a
h, c, i
h, c, i
End of example.
train input:
e, a, a
a, c, a
a, a, a
train output:
e, a, a
e, c, a
e, c, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is simple substitution. Each row of the input represents a 2D grid, where each letter in the row corresponds to a specific position on the grid. The goal is to find the correct letter to place at each position based on the pattern shown in the corresponding row of the output.

Here's how the pattern works:

1. Every second row (starting from the top) is a "don't care" row, which means any letter can be placed at that position.
2. Every odd-numbered row (starting from the top) contains a single letter that must be placed at the corresponding position in the output. This letter is the same for every input in that row.
3. The last row (bottom row) of the input contains the final output letter.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input: e, a, i

Step 1: Don't care rows (top two rows) - any letter can go here.

Input: e, a, i
Output: [e, a, i]

Step 2: Odd-numbered rows (middle three rows) - place the letter from the corresponding row in the output.

Input: e, a, i
Output: [e, a, a]
[i, a, a]

Step 3: Last row (bottom row) - place the final output letter.

Input: e, a, i
Output: [e, a, i]

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is [e, a, i].
