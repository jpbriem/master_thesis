LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, f, a
f, f, c
a, a, a
train output:
a, f, a, a, f, a
f, f, c, f, f, c
a, a, a, a, a, a
End of example.
train input:
d, a, a
c, d, a

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one letter to the right each time, while also changing the top row of the input based on the following rules:

1. If the top row of the input is "a", then the corresponding output will be "a".
2. If the top row of the input is "f", then the corresponding output will be the same as the input, shifted by one letter to the right.
3. If the top row of the input is "c", then the corresponding output will be the opposite of the input (i.e., if the input is "c", the output will be "d").
4. If the top row of the input is "d", then the corresponding output will be the same as the input, shifted by one letter to the right.
5. If the top row of the input is "i", then the corresponding output will be "i".

Using these rules, we can now apply them to the test input:

Test input: e, a, a, a

Step 1: Shift the input by one letter to the right, so the new input is:
e, a, a, a, e

Step 2: Check the top row of the input, which is "e". Since it's not "a" or "f", the output will be the same as the input, shifted by one letter to the right:
e, a, a, a, e

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining rows of the input:

e, a, a, a, e
e, a, a, a, e
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a

The final output for the test input is:
e, a, a, a, e

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle.
