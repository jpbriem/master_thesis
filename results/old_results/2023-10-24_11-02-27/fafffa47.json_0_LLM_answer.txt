LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these puzzles involves shifting the top row of letters by one position to the right, while maintaining the same sequence of letters in each row. Here's how you can apply this pattern to solve the remaining examples:

1. Train input: `a, j, j`
Output: `c, a, a`
Explanation: Shift the top row of letters by one position to the right, resulting in `c, a, a`.
2. Train input: `j, a, j`
Output: `a, c, a`
Explanation: Apply the shift operation to the top row of letters, resulting in `a, c, a`.
3. Train input: `a, j, a`
Output: `a, c, c`
Explanation: Shift the top row of letters by two positions to the right, resulting in `a, c, c`.
4. Train input: `b, a, b`
Output: `a, c, a`
Explanation: Apply the shift operation to the top row of letters, resulting in `a, c, a`.
5. Test input: `j, a, j`
Output: `[c, a, a]`
Explanation: Apply the shift operation to the top row of letters, resulting in `[c, a, a]`.

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle using the pattern you identified.
