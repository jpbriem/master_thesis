LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
a, c, a, a, c
c, c, a, c, c
a, a, a, a, a
a, c, a, c, c
c, c, a, c, a
train output:
c, c
c, a
End of example.
train input:
b, a, a, b, a
a, b, a, a, b
a, a, a, a, a
b, a, a, b, a
b, b, a, a, b
train output:
b, a
b, b
End of example.
train input:
i, i, a, a, i
i, a, a, i, a
a, a, a, a, a
i, i, a, i, i
i, a, a, i, a
train output:
a, i
i, a
End of example.
test input:
f, f, a, f, a
a, f, a, a, f
a, a, a, a, a
f, f, a, f, f
a, f, a, a, f

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of inputs and outputs is a simple rotation of one letter in the output compared to the input. Specifically, when an "a" appears in the input, it becomes an "a" in the output with a clockwise rotation of one position. When any other letter appears in the input, it remains unchanged in the output.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input: f, f, a, f, a

Step 1: Rotate the first "f" in the input by one position clockwise to get the output:

Output: a, f, a, f, a

Step 2: Rotate the second "f" in the input by one position clockwise to get the output:

Output: a, f, a, f, a

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining letters in the input until you reach the end:

Output: a, f, a, f, a

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is "a, f, a, f, a".

Solution:
f, a
a, f
