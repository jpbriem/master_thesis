LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been given a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you've observed in the examples, your goal is to determine the general rule or algorithm that can be applied to any input to produce the corresponding output. Here are some observations and potential strategies to help you solve this puzzle:

1. Observe the patterns in the input and output pairs:
	* In each example, the input consists of a sequence of letters (usually "a"s and "b"s), while the output is also a sequence of letters.
	* The sequences of letters seem to follow a particular pattern, such as alternating between two or three letters, or repeating a letter a certain number of times.
	* Some examples also involve the use of special symbols ("h", "g", "c") which may represent specific operations or transformations.
2. Look for simple rules or patterns:
	* Based on the examples provided, it seems that the puzzle involves applying a simple operation to each letter in the input sequence, resulting in the corresponding output letter. For instance, in the first example, every input letter is replaced by the letter directly after it in the alphabet (e.g., "a" becomes "b", "b" becomes "c", etc.).
	* Another possible rule could involve shifting the letters in the input sequence by a fixed number of positions (either left or right).
3. Consider the role of special symbols:
	* As mentioned earlier, some examples include special symbols like "h", "g", and "c". These symbols might represent specific operations or transformations that need to be applied to the input sequence.
	* For example, the symbol "h" might indicate that the next letter in the input sequence should be repeated twice, while the symbol "g" might mean that the next letter should be repeated once and then shifted over by one position in the alphabet.
4. Test your hypotheses:
	* Once you have a good idea of the general rule or algorithm involved in the puzzle, try applying it to different input sequences to see if they result in the correct output.
	* Start with simple input sequences and gradually increase their complexity to challenge yourself and refine your understanding of the puzzle.
5. Reflect and adapt:
	* As you work through more examples and encounter new challenges, reflect on what you've learned and adjust your approach as needed.
	* Don't be afraid to revisit previous assumptions or strategies if they no longer hold true based on new information.

By following these steps and staying focused, you should be able to crack the code and solve the puzzle!
