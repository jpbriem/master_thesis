LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down each example and identify the pattern in the steps to solve them.

Example 1:

* Input: `b, b, d, c, b, b, d, c`
* Output: `b, b, d, c`

The pattern here is that every other letter is repeated twice. So, if we start with the first letter of the input (which is `b`), we can repeat it twice to get the second letter (`b`). We then repeat this process for the remaining letters, alternating between repeating the previous letter and moving on to the next one. This gives us the output `b, b, d, c`.

Example 2:

* Input: `e, e, e, e, e, e`
* Output: `e, e`

The pattern here is that every input contains exactly one `e`. Since there are six inputs, the output should be `e, e`.

Example 3:

* Input: `c, d`
* Output: `c, d`

The pattern here is that both inputs contain only two letters, which are repeated once each. Therefore, the output is also just two letters long, which is `c, d`.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

* Test input: `f, e, f, e, g, g, e`

Using the pattern from Example 1, we can generate the output: `f, e, f, e, g, g, e`.

Using the pattern from Example 2, we can generate the output: `e, e`.

And using the pattern from Example 3, we can generate the output: `c, d`.

Therefore, the test output is `f, e, f, e, g, g, e, c, d`.
