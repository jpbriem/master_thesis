LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been provided with a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you've observed in the examples, I can suggest a general approach to solving this type of puzzles:

1. Identify the repeating pattern: In each example, there is a repeating pattern of letters that appears multiple times. For instance, in the first example, the pattern is "c, c". In the second example, it's "a, a". Try to find these repeating patterns in each input-output pair.
2. Find the hidden rule: Once you've identified the repeating pattern, try to find a simple rule or formula that governs how the pattern is used. For example, in the first example, the rule could be "if the top two letters are 'c', then the bottom letter is 'a'."
3. Apply the rule: Using the rule you've found, try to apply it to the test input. Start by filling in the blanks with the appropriate letters based on the pattern you've identified. Then, use the rule to determine the final output.

Here's how this approach would work for the test input you provided:

Test input: c, c, a, c, c, a, a

Repeating pattern: c, c
Hidden rule: If the top two letters are 'c', then the bottom letter is 'a'.

Applying the rule:

c, c -> a, a (first occurrence)
c, c -> a, a (second occurrence)
a, c -> a, a (third occurrence)

Therefore, the test output is:
[a, a, a, a, a, a]

I hope this helps you solve more puzzles like this! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
