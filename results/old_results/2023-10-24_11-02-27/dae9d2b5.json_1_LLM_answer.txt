LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of input and output is as follows:

1. Each row of the input contains exactly one "e" symbol.
2. Each row of the output consists of exactly one letter, which is either "g" or "a".
3. Whenever there are two consecutive "e" symbols in the input, they are replaced by a single "a" symbol in the output.
4. Whenever there are two consecutive non-"e" symbols (i.e., "a", "d") in the input, they are replaced by a single "g" symbol in the output.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

test input: a, a, e, a, d, a

Applying the pattern, we get:

test output: a, g, a, g, a

So the final output for the test input is "a, g, a, g, a".

Solution:
a, g, g
g, g, g
g, a, a
