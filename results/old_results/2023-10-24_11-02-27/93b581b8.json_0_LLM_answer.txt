LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle together. From the information provided, we can see that each row in the input represents a different letter, and each column represents a different position on the grid. The goal is to find a pattern that takes the input row and transforms it into the corresponding output row.

From the first two examples, we can observe that the pattern involves replacing every second letter (starting from the left) with the next letter in the alphabet. For example, in the first example, the input "a" becomes "e", then "g", then "a" again, and so on.

Based on this observation, let's try applying the same pattern to the test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a, a

Step 1: Replace every second letter with the next letter in the alphabet. Starting from the left, we have:

a -> e
a -> g
a -> a
a -> b
a -> f
a -> f

Step 2: Repeat Step 1 for each subsequent letter in the input. We get:

e -> g
g -> h
a -> a
b -> c
f -> d
f -> d

The resulting transformed input is:

g, g, a, c, d, d

Now, let's apply the same pattern to the remaining test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a, a

Step 1: Replace every second letter with the next letter in the alphabet. Starting from the left, we have:

a -> e
a -> g
a -> a
a -> b
a -> f
a -> f

Step 2: Repeat Step 1 for each subsequent letter in the input. We get:

e -> g
g -> h
a -> a
b -> c
f -> d
f -> d

The resulting transformed input is:

g, g, a, c, d, d

As expected, the transformed input matches the output provided in the training data. Therefore, the pattern we observed in the training data appears to be the correct solution to the puzzle!
