LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

Example 1:
Input: a, a, a, a, a
Output: a, a, a, a, a

Pattern observed: Each input row has the same letter (in this case, 'a') repeated four times.

Example 2:
Input: a, a, a, a, a
Output: a, a, a, a, a

Pattern observed: The input and output rows have the same length (4 letters).

Example 3:
Input: a, a, a, a, a
Output: a, a, a, a, a

Pattern observed: The output rows have the same letter (in this case, 'a') repeated four times.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the pattern in the output for each input is simply repeating the input letter four times. Therefore, if we provide the following test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a

We can expect the following test output:

Test output: a, a, a, a, a

Which matches the expected output based on the pattern observed in the previous examples.

Solution:
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, f, a, f
f, f, b, f, b
