LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, h, a
a, a, h
a, h, h
train output:
a, h, a, a, h, a
a, a, h, h, a, a
a, h, h, h, h, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one letter to the right each time, while also changing the top row of the input accordingly. Here's how the pattern works:

1. If the top row of the input is "a", then the output will be the same as the input, except with the top row shifted to the right by one letter.
2. If the top row of the input is "h", then the output will be the same as the input, except with the top row shifted to the right by two letters (i.e., "h" becomes "hh").
3. Otherwise (i.e., if the top row of the input is not "a" or "h"), the output will be the same as the input.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input: h, h, a

Step 1: Shift the top row of the input ("h") to the right by one letter, resulting in "hh".

Input: hh, h, a

Step 2: Shift the top row of the input ("hh") to the right by one letter, resulting in "hhh".

Input: hhh, h, a

Step 3: Shift the top row of the input ("hhh") to the right by one letter, resulting in "hhhh".

Input: hhhh, h, a

The final output for the test input is "hhhh, h, a".

Solution:
h, h, a, a, h, h
a, h, a, a, h, a
a, a, h, h, a, a
