LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down the pattern in the training examples:

1. Each row has exactly 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s.
2. Every other row has an "a" followed by an "i".
3. When there is an "i" followed by an "a", it is always preceded by another "i".
4. The last letter of each row is always "a".

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, i, i

Step 1: Read the first row. There are 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s, so we have:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

Step 2: Read the second row. There are 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s, so we have:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

Step 3: Read the third row. There are 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s, so we have:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

Step 4: Read the fourth row. There are 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s, so we have:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

Step 5: Read the fifth row. There are 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s, so we have:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

Step 6: Read the sixth row. There are 3 "a"s and 2 "i"s, so we have:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

The output for the test input is:
a, a, a, a, a, i, i

So, the pattern in the training examples can be used to generate the correct output for the test input.
