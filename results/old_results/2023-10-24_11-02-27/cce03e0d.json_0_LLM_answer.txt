LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve the first example.

The pattern we observe in the training examples is that each row has the same sequence of characters (either "a" or "b"), repeated twice. Additionally, the last character of each row is always "a".

So, if we want to get the output for the test input "b, c, c", we can simply repeat the sequence of characters in the last row of the training examples (i.e., "a, a, a") three times, and then add the last character of the test input ("c"). Therefore, the output for the test input is:

"a, a, a, c"

Now let's move on to the second example. Again, we see a repeating sequence of characters (this time "a, b, a") followed by the last character of the input. So, for the test input "c, a, b", we can repeat the sequence of characters in the last row of the training examples ("a, a, a") once, and then add the last character of the test input ("b"). Therefore, the output for the test input is:

"a, a, a, b"

Let's continue this process for the third example. We have "c, b, c" as the test input, which we can repeat the sequence of characters in the last row of the training examples ("a, a, a") two times, and then add the last character of the test input ("c"). Therefore, the output for the test input is:

"a, a, a, c, c"

Great! Now you should be able to apply this pattern to any test input and get the correct output.
