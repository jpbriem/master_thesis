LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down each example and identify the pattern for each one.

Example 1:

* Input: `i, i, a, a, e, a, f, f, a`
* Output: `c, a, c`

The pattern here is that every other letter is repeated twice. So, if the first letter is `i`, then the second letter will be `i` again, followed by `a`, `a`, `e`, `a`, `f`, `f`, and finally `a`. This pattern repeats throughout the input, so the output is `c, a, c`.

Example 2:

* Input: `a, i, a, a, e, f, a, f, a`
* Output: `c, c, c, a`

The pattern here is similar to the previous example, but with a different sequence of letters. Every other letter is repeated twice, except for the last two letters which are repeated only once. So, the input `a, i, a, a, e, f, a, f, a` becomes the output `c, c, c, a`.

Example 3:

* Input: `a, i, a, a, e, a, f, f, a`
* Output: `a, c, c`

The pattern here is slightly different than the previous two examples. Every other letter is repeated twice, but there are also some additional patterns at work. For example, the letters `a` and `e` appear together twice in the input, and the letters `f` and `a` appear together three times. These patterns repeat throughout the input, so the output is `a, c, c`.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input you provided:

* Test input: `a, i, a, a, e, f, a, a, a`

Using the pattern from Example 1, we can see that every other letter is repeated twice. So, the input `a, i, a, a, e, f, a, a, a` becomes the output `c, a, c`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the examples.
