LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform each row of letters into another row of letters. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

1. Look for repeating patterns: In each row of the input, look for any repeating patterns of letters or sequences of letters. For example, in the first row of the input, there are two consecutive "a"s followed by an "e". This could be a starting point for your pattern.
2. Identify the transformation rule: Once you've found a repeating pattern, try to identify the transformation rule that is being applied to turn one letter into another. For example, if you see the sequence "a -> ae", then you know that the letter "a" is being transformed into "ae".
3. Apply the transformation rule: Now that you have identified the transformation rule, apply it to each letter in the input row using the corresponding output letter. For example, if the transformation rule is "a -> ae", then you would replace every "a" in the input row with "ae".
4. Repeat steps 1-3: Continue looking for repeating patterns and applying the transformation rules until you have transformed all the letters in the input row into their corresponding output letters.
5. Move on to the next input row: Once you have transformed all the letters in one input row, move on to the next row and repeat the process.
6. Repeat until done: Keep repeating steps 1-5 until you have transformed all the input rows into their corresponding output rows.

By following these steps, you should be able to solve the puzzle and identify the step-by-step pattern required to transform each row of letters into another row of letters. Good luck!
