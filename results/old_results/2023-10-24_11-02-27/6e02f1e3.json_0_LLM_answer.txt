LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply replacing each letter in the input with the next letter in the alphabet (ignoring any duplicates). So, if we apply this pattern to the test input, we get:

Test output: f, a, a

2. Second example:
This pattern seems to involve rotating the input by 90 degrees clockwise. Specifically, for each row of the input, we replace the first letter with the last letter of the previous row, and then repeat this process for each subsequent letter. Applying this pattern to the test input gives us:

Test output: a, a, f

3. Third example:
Here, we have a more complex pattern involving both rotation and replacement. For each row of the input, we rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise, and then replace each letter with the corresponding letter three positions ahead in the alphabet (wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary). Using this pattern on the test input yields:

Test output: f, a, a

4. Fourth example:
This pattern involves repeating the input sequence twice before applying any modifications. Specifically, we take the first two letters of the input, repeat them twice, and then modify the resulting sequence according to some rule (in this case, replacing every other letter with the next letter in the alphabet). Applying this pattern to the test input results in:

Test output: a, a, f

5. Fifth example:
In this case, the pattern appears to involve simply repeating the input sequence twice before modifying it. Specifically, we take the input sequence, repeat it twice, and then replace every other letter with the next letter in the alphabet. Using this pattern on the test input gives us:

Test output: f, a, a

Based on these observations, I believe that the correct answer for the final test input is:

Test output: f, a, a
