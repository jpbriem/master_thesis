LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been provided with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you've observed in the examples, your goal is to determine the step-by-step process to transform the input into the corresponding output.

Here's how you can approach this problem:

1. Identify common elements between input and output pairs: Look at each input and output pair carefully. Are there any common elements or patterns that emerge? For instance, in some cases, the input consists of multiple "a"s followed by a single non-"a" character (e.g., "a", "a", "b").
2. Determine the transformation rule: Once you've identified common elements, try to devise a simple transformation rule based on those elements. For example, if the input always consists of multiple "a"s followed by a single non-"a" character, you could write a rule like "replace every sequence of 'a's with the next non-'a' character."
3. Apply the transformation rule to the test input: Now that you have a transformation rule, apply it to the test input. Start by replacing each sequence of "a"s with the corresponding non-"a" character according to your rule. Repeat this process until you have transformed the entire input into the expected output.
4. Check your solution: After applying the transformation rule, verify that the resulting output matches the expected output. If it doesn't match, go back to the previous steps and refine your transformation rule accordingly.

By following these steps, you should be able to solve the puzzle and determine the step-by-step process to transform the input into the desired output. Good luck!
