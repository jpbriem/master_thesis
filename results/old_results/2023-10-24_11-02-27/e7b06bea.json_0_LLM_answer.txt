LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're given a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you observed in the training examples, your goal is to determine the general rule or strategy that can be applied to any input to obtain the corresponding output.

From the provided examples, we can observe some common patterns:

1. Repetition of certain cells: In many cases, specific cells (e.g., "a" or "d") are repeated multiple times in a row or column. This suggests that these cells may play an important role in determining the output.
2. Row and column operations: Some examples involve performing operations like "a → b" or "a → c", which suggest that the values in each row or column may need to be manipulated in some way to produce the output.
3. Combinations of operations: Some examples combine different operations, such as "a → b; a → c" or "a → b, a → c". These combinations may indicate more complex rules for determining the output.
4. Use of special symbols: The symbol "c" appears in some examples, which may represent a specific operation or value. Similarly, the symbol "i" may also have a specific meaning.

Based on these observations, here's a possible approach for solving the puzzle:

1. Identify repeating cells: Look for cells that appear repeatedly in the input, such as "a" or "d". These cells may play a crucial role in determining the output.
2. Perform row and column operations: Check if there are any operations specified in the input, such as "a → b" or "a → c". If so, perform those operations on each row and column separately to see if it affects the output.
3. Combine operations: If there are multiple operations specified, try combining them in different ways to see if they lead to the desired output. For example, "a → b; a → c" could become "a → (b + c)".
4. Use special symbols: Keep an eye out for special symbols like "c" and "i". They may represent specific operations or values that need to be taken into account when determining the output.
5. Test your approach: Once you think you have identified the general rule or strategy, apply it to the test input ("f, a, a, a, a, e, i, d"). If the output matches what's expected, then you've likely solved the puzzle! Otherwise, refine your approach and repeat the process until you arrive at the correct solution.
