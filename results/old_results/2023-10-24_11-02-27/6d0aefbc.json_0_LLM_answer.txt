LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
g, g, g
b, g, b
i, i, g
train output:
g, g, g, g, g, g
b, g, b, b, g, b
i, i, g, g, i, i
End of example.
train input:
g, i, b
g, b, b
b, b, g
train output:
g, i, b, b, i, g
g, b, b, b, b, g
b, b, g, g, b, b
End of example.
train input:
b, b, b
i, b, g
g, i, i
train output:
b, b, b, b, b, b
i, b, g, g, b, i
g, i, i, i, i, g
End of example.
train input:
b, b, b

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these types of puzzles involves shifting the input letters by one position to the right, and then applying the following rules:

1. If the shifted letter is "g", it remains unchanged.
2. If the shifted letter is "b", it becomes the previous letter (i.e., if the original letter was "a", the shifted letter becomes "a").
3. If the shifted letter is "i", it becomes the next letter after the original letter (i.e., if the original letter was "a", the shifted letter becomes "c").

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input: g, i, g
Shifted input: g, i, g
Applied rule 1: g remains unchanged
Applied rule 2: i becomes c
Applied rule 3: g becomes g

Therefore, the test output is:
g, c, g

Solution:
g, i, g, g, i, g
i, g, i, i, g, i
b, g, b, b, g, b
