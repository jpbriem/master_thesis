Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (1)

You are using a different model for training and testing. The `model_name` argument in `tf.keras.models.load_model()` specifies the name of the saved model to load. If you don't specify it, then Keras will look for a model with the default name, which is usually something like `model`.

If you want to use the same model for training and testing, you need to save the model after training with the same name as you used when loading it. For example, if you trained a model called `my_model`, you could save it with the following code:

```
model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)
model.save('my_model')
```

Then you can load the same model with the following code:

```
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model')
```
