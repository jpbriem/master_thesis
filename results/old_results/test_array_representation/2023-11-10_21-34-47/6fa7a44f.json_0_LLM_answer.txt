Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (0)

You are using a different model for each set of data. The first model is trained on `[[9, 1, 4], [9, 1, 4], [2, 1, 1]]`, the second model is trained on `[[4, 8, 4], [7, 6, 7], [8, 7, 8]]`, etc.

If you want to use the same model for all sets of data, you need to define it beforehand and then pass it as an argument to the function that trains the models. For example:

```
def train_model(X, y):
    # Define the model here
    model =...
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

# Train the models
models = []
for X, y in zip([[[9, 1, 4], [9, 1, 4], [2, 1, 1]], [[4, 8, 4], [7, 6, 7], [8, 7, 8]], [[7, 7, 7], [9, 5, 5], [5, 1, 7]], [[2, 6, 9], [2, 6, 9], [2, 9, 2]], [[8, 5, 2], [2, 2, 8]]]:
    model = train_model(X, y)
    models.append(model)
```
