Comment: What is the expected output?

## Answer (1)

You can use `numpy.where()` to replace the values in your array with their corresponding values from another array. You can then use `np.array()` to convert the resulting array back into a numpy array and then use `np.reshape()` to reshape it as needed.

Here's an example of how you could do this:

```
import numpy as np

# Define arrays
arr = np.array([[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],
                 [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]])

lookup_table = np.array([[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],
                         [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]])

# Replace values in arr using lookup table
arr = np.where(arr == lookup_table[:, :-1], lookup_table[:, -1], arr)

# Reshape array
arr = np.reshape(arr, (-1, 9))

print(arr)
```

Output:

```
array([[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],
       [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]])
```
