Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (1)

You are using a different model for training and testing. The first model has 5 hidden layers and 10 neurons in each layer, while the second model has only one hidden layer with 5 neurons.

To use the same model for both training and testing, you need to define the same architecture for both models. In this case, you would have to define the same number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, etc.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to create two identical models for training and testing:

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=10, input_dim=6))
model.add(Dense(units=10))
model.add(Dense(units=1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# Train the model
X_train =... # Input data for training
y_train =... # Output labels for training
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model on test data
X_test =... # Input data for testing
y_test =... # Output labels for testing
score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test loss:', score[0])
```
