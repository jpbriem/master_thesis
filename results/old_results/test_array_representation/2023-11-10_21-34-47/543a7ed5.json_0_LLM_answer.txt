I'm not sure how to approach this problem. I tried using a loop and if statements but it didn't work out. Any help would be appreciated!

Comment: What is the expected output?

## Answer (1)

You can use `numpy` for this task. Here is one way of doing it:

```
import numpy as np

def find_matches(X, y):
    X = np.array(X)
    y = np.array(y)
    matches = []
    for i in range(len(X)):
        match = None
        for j in range(len(y)):
            if np.allclose(X[i], y[j]):
                match = j
                break
        if match is not None:
            matches.append(match)
    return matches
```

Here is an example usage:

```
In [2]: X = [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
           [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
           [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6,
