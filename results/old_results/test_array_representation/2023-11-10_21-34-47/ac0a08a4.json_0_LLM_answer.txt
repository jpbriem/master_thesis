Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can use the same model for both training and testing but you need to split your data into two sets. One set is used for training and the other for testing.

## Answer (1)

You can use the same model for both training and testing. But you have to split your data into two sets. One set is used for training and the other for testing.

Here is an example of how you could do this in TensorFlow using Keras:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Train the model on the training set
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model on the testing set
score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test loss:', score[0])
```
