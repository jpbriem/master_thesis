Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (0)

You are using a different model for each set of data. The first model is trained on `[[6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1], [8, 8, 6]]`, the second model is trained on `[[6, 8, 1], [6, 1, 1], [1, 1, 6]]`, etc.

If you want to use the same model for all sets of data, you need to train it once on all of them together.
