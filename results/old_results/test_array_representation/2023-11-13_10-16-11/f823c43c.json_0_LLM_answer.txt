LLM answer:

\end{code}

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the code is not working". What happens when you run it? Do you get an error message? If so, please post the full traceback. Also, can you show us a sample of your data (either in text or image form)?

Answer: You are using `np.argmax` to find the index of the maximum value in each row of your array. However, this will only work if there is exactly one maximum per row. In other words, all values must be unique. This is clearly not the case for your data, as evidenced by the fact that you have multiple rows with identical values.

To fix this problem, you need to use a different function that can handle non-unique values. One option would be to use [`scipy.stats.mode`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mode.html), which returns the most common value in each row. Another option would be to use [`numpy.where`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) and specify a condition that checks whether two values are equal.
