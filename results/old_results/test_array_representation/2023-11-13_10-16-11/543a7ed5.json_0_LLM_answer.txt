LLM answer:

\end{code}

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the code is too long". You can post the entire code in your question. If it's too long to fit into a single comment, just edit your original question and add the code there.

Answer: The problem is that you are using `np.argmax` on an array of shape `(10, 2)`. This function returns the index of the maximum value along each axis, so for example if you have an array like this:

\begin{code}
>>> arr = np.array([[5, 7], [9, 1]])
>>> print(arr)
[[5 7]
 [9  1]]
>>> print(np.argmax(arr))
[0 1]
\end{code}

The first element of the result corresponds to the row with the highest value (in this case, `[9, 1]`), while the second element corresponds to the column with the highest value (`1`).

In your case, since all values are equal, both elements will be zero. So when you do something like this:

\begin{code}
if test_input[i][j] == 8:
    test_output[i][j] = 8
elif test_input[i][j] == 6 or test_input[i][j] == 3:
    test_output[i][j] = 6
else:
    test_output[i][j] = 0
\end{code}

You are setting every cell to either 0 or 8, depending on whether its value is 6 or 3.

To fix this, you need to change how you use `np.argmax`. For example, you could try replacing the line where you define `test_output`:

\begin{code}
test_output = np.zeros((len(test_input), len(test_input[0])), dtype=int)
\end{code}

with this one instead:

\begin{code}
test_output = np.copy(test_input)
\end{code}

This way, `test_output` will start out as a copy of `test_input`, which means that the cells corresponding to 6 and 3 will already contain their correct values. Then, you only need to update the cells containing 8:

\begin{code}
for i in range(len(test_input)):
    for j in range(len(test_input[0])):
        if test_input[i][j] == 8:
            test_output[i][j] = 8
\end{code}
