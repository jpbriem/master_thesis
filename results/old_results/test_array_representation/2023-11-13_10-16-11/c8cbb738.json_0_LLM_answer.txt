LLM answer:

\end{code}

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the code is too long". You can post the entire code in your question. If it's too long to fit into a single comment, just edit your original question and add it there.

Answer: The problem is that you are using `np.argmax` on an array of shape `(n_samples, n_classes)`. This function returns the index of the maximum value along each axis (i.e., for each sample). So if you have two samples with three classes each, this will return something like `[0, 1]` which means that the first class has the highest probability for the first sample, while the second class has the highest probability for the second sample.

What you want instead is to get the \em{index} of the maximum value across all samples. To do so, use [`np.argmax`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html) without specifying any axes:

\begin{blockquote}
If no axis is specified, the result is equivalent to applying argmax to self with axis=None.
\end{blockquote}

So simply change the line where you calculate the predicted labels from

\begin{code}
predicted = np.argmax(yhat, axis=-1)
\end{code}

to

\begin{code}
predicted = np.argmax(yhat)
\end{code}
