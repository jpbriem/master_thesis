Answer: Your model is suffering from a problem called "overfitting". Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. This causes the model to perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data (like the test data you provided).

To address this issue, there are several things you can try:

1. Increase the size of your training dataset: With more data, your model will have more information to learn from and may be less likely to overfit.
2. Use regularization: Regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights.
3. Use early stopping: Early stopping is a technique where you stop training the model when its performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Use a simpler model architecture: A simpler model architecture may be less prone to overfitting than a complex one. You can try reducing the number of layers or the number of units in each layer.
5. Use dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons to zero during training. This helps prevent overfitting by making the model less reliant on any single neuron.
6. Use batch normalization: Batch normalization normalizes the inputs to each layer, which can help reduce overfitting by reducing the effect of outliers in the data.
7. Try a different optimizer: Some optimizers, such as Adam, RMSProp, and Adagrad, have built-in mechanisms for reducing the learning rate as the training progresses. This can help prevent overfitting by gradually reducing the step size of the updates.
8. Data augmentation: Data augmentation can help increase the size of your training dataset by generating additional samples from existing data. This can help improve the generalization of your model.

It's worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to overfitting, and the best approach will depend on the specific problem you're trying to solve. You may need to experiment with a combination of these techniques to find what works best for your particular use case.
