LLM answer:

Expected output:
[[8, 8, 8], [4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8]]
```

In this example, the model is trained on three different inputs and outputs, and then tested on a separate input. The expected output for the test input is also provided.

It's worth noting that in real-world scenarios, you would typically have many more training examples than just three, and you would also use techniques like data augmentation to artificially increase the size of your training set. Additionally, the test set would typically be a separate dataset that the model has never seen before, and would be used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
