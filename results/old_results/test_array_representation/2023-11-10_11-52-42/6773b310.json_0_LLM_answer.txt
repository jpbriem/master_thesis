LLM answer:

\end{code}

I'm not sure what the problem is. The model seems to be working fine on the training data but it's not able to predict correctly on the test data. Can someone please help me figure out what's going wrong?

Answer: It looks like you are trying to use a neural network to solve a problem that can be solved using simple logic. The task is to identify whether a given number is negative, positive, or zero. However, your neural network is not able to learn this pattern because the input values are all zeros except for one value which is either 6 or 8.

The issue with your approach is that the neural network is not able to learn any meaningful patterns from the input data because all the inputs are similar, and the output values are not providing enough information to learn the correct mapping between inputs and outputs.

To solve this problem, you don't need a neural network. You can simply use a lookup table with three entries, where each entry corresponds to a possible output (negative, positive, or zero) and contains the corresponding input value. Then, you can use a simple indexing function to map the input value to the appropriate output value.

Alternatively, if you insist on using a neural network, you could try using a much larger dataset with a wider range of input values, and ensure that the outputs are properly balanced across the different classes. This would allow the neural network to learn more robust features and make more accurate predictions.
