Answer: The issue is that your model has learned to recognize the pattern in the training data, but it's not generalizing well to new data. This is a common problem in machine learning called overfitting.

To address this, you can try the following approaches:

1. Increase the size of the training data: By having more data to learn from, the model can learn more robust features and avoid overfitting to the training data.
2. Use regularization: Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization can help prevent the model from overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
3. Use early stopping: Early stopping is a technique where the training process is stopped before the model overfits to the training data. This can be done by monitoring the validation loss during training and stopping the training when the validation loss stops improving.
4. Use a different architecture: Sometimes, a simpler architecture can work better than a complex one. You can try using a smaller CNN with fewer layers and fewer filters per layer.
5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that involves applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to the training data. This can help the model generalize better to new data.
6. Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods like bagging or boosting can help improve the performance of the model by combining multiple models trained on the same data.
7. Try different optimization algorithms: Different optimization algorithms like Adam, RMSProp, or SGD can have different convergence properties, and some might work better for your specific problem.
8. Learning rate scheduling: Learning rate scheduling is a technique that involves reducing the learning rate as the training progresses. This can help prevent overshooting and improve the convergence of the model.
