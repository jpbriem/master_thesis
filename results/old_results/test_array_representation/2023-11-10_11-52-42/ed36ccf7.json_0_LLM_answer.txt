LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]]

But the actual result is different. What's wrong?

Answer: The problem is that your training data contains only a single example of each class (i.e., 3 examples for 3 classes). This is not enough for the model to learn useful patterns and relationships between the inputs and outputs. As a result, the model is essentially memorizing the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.

To fix this issue, you need to provide more diverse and extensive training data that covers various combinations of input features and corresponding output labels. For example, you can create additional training data by applying random transformations (such as rotation, flipping, and cropping) to the existing images, and then labeling them accordingly. This will help the model learn more robust features that are less dependent on specific image orientations or pixel values.

Another approach is to use data augmentation techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Simulation-based Data Augmentation (SBDA), to generate new training data that mimics real-world variations in the input data. By doing so, you can effectively increase the size of your training dataset without requiring manual annotation of large amounts of data.
