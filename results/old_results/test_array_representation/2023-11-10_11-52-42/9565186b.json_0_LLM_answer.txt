LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[2, 2, 2], [5, 5, 5], [2, 2, 2]]

But the actual result is different. What's wrong with my code?

Answer: The issue with your code is that you are using a list as a cache for the weights and biases of the layers. This means that every time you call `forward` on a layer, it will use the same set of weights and biases for all inputs in that layer.

To fix this, you should create a new instance of the weight and bias tensors for each input in the forward pass. You can do this by moving the creation of the weight and bias tensors inside the `forward` method, and passing them as arguments to the `conv2d` and `dense` layers.

Here's an example of how you could modify your code to fix this issue:
```
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 10, kernel_size=3)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(10, 20, kernel_size=3)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(320, 50)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(-1, 320)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)
```
In this modified version of the code, the weight and bias tensors are created fresh for each input in the `forward` method, and passed as arguments to the `conv2d` and `dense` layers. This ensures that each input gets its own set of weights and biases, which should improve the performance of the network.
