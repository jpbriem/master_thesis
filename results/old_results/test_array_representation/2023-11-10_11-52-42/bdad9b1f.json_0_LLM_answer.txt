LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

But the actual result is different. The model predicts all zeroes for test input. I don't understand why this happens. Can someone explain to me what's going on?

Answer: It looks like your model has learned a trivial solution, meaning it always outputs zero regardless of the input. This can happen when the model is overfitting or underfitting. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:

1. Overfitting: The model might be too complex and has learned the noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns. Try using a simpler model (e.g., fewer layers or fewer neurons per layer) and see if it generalizes better to new data.
2. Underfitting: The model might not have enough capacity to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Try increasing the size of the model (e.g., adding more layers or neurons) and see if it improves the performance.
3. Training/Testing imbalance: Make sure that your training and testing sets are balanced in terms of class distribution. If one class dominates the other in either set, it may cause issues during training. You can try oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using class weights to balance the classes.
4. Data preprocessing: Check if there are any inconsistencies in the data preprocessing between the training and testing sets. For example, make sure that the input data is normalized or scaled similarly in both sets.
5. Model implementation: Double-check the code implementing the neural network to ensure that it is correct and consistent with the expected behavior.
6. Optimizer and hyperparameters: Verify that the optimizer and hyperparameters used for training are appropriate for the problem at hand. You may need to experiment with different combinations to find the best match.
7. Collapse of the neural network: It's possible that the neural network has collapsed, meaning that all the weights have become zero. This can happen due to various reasons such as poor initialization, inappropriate regularization, or unstable optimization. In this case, you may need to restart the training process with a different initialization scheme or regularization technique.

To investigate further, you can try visualizing the training and testing error curves, monitoring the model's performance on both sets during training. Additionally, you can use techniques like gradient checking or activation maximization to gain insights into how the model works and identify potential issues.
