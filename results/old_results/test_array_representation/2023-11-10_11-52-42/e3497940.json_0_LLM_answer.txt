\end{code}

I'm trying to create a neural network that can solve this problem. I have tried various architectures and hyperparameters but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me with this?

Answer: This is a classic example of a "traffic light" problem, which is a type of sequential decision-making problem. The goal is to learn a policy that maps the current state (the color of the traffic light) to the next state (the color of the traffic light after one time step).

To solve this problem using reinforcement learning, you need to define a reward function that captures your desired behavior. For example, you could use the following reward function:

* If the current state is green and the next state is green, the reward is +1.
* If the current state is red and the next state is green, the reward is +1.
* If the current state is yellow and the next state is green, the reward is -1.
* Otherwise, the reward is 0.

This reward function encourages the agent to stay on green as long as possible and to switch to red only when necessary.

Next, you need to define the states and actions in your environment. In this case, the states are the colors of the traffic light (green, yellow, or red), and the actions are the possible transitions between these states (e.g., from green to yellow, from yellow to red, etc.). You can represent the environment as a Markov chain, where each state has a set of probabilities for transitioning to other states.

Once you have defined the environment, you can use reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning or SARSA to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

Here's some sample Python code to get you started:
```python
import numpy as np
import gym

# Define the states and actions
states = ['green', 'yellow','red']
actions = ['green_to_yellow', 'yellow_to_red','red_to_green']

# Define the reward function
def get_reward(state, action):
    if state == 'green' and action == 'green_to_yellow':
        return 1
    elif state == 'yellow' and action == 'yellow_to_red':
        return 1
    elif state =='red' and action =='red_to_green':
        return -1
    else:
        return 0

# Create the environment
env = gym.make('TrafficLightEnvironment', states=states, actions=actions, reward_fn=get_reward)

# Learn an optimal policy using Q-learning
q_table = {}
for state in states:
    q_table[state] = np.zeros(len(actions))

for episode in range(1000):
    # Reset the environment
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    rewards = 0
    while not done:
        # Select an action based on epsilon-greedy
        action = np.random.choice(actions, p=[1 - 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])
        new_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        rewards += reward
        q_table[state][action] = q_table[state][action] + reward
        state = new_state

    # Update the Q-table
    for state in q_table:
        for action in q_table[state]:
            q_table[state][action] = (1 - 0.1) * q_table[state][action] + 0.1 * rewards

# Print the learned Q-values
print(q_table)
```
This code defines a simple environment using `gym`, specifies the reward function, and uses Q-learning to learn an optimal policy. The learned Q-values are printed at the end of the script.
