LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]

But the actual result is different. What's wrong?

Answer:
The problem is that the neural network has not been trained to recognize the digit 6. The training data only contains the digits 0, 3, 8, and 9, so the network has not learned to recognize any other digits. Therefore, when it encounters a 6 in the test data, it does not know how to classify it and produces incorrect results.

To fix this problem, you need to add more diverse data to your training set, including examples of the digit 6. You can also try increasing the size of the neural network or using a different architecture to improve its ability to generalize to new inputs.

Solution:
[[6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]
