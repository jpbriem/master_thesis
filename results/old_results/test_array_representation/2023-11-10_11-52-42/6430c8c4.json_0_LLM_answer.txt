I'm trying to create a neural network that can solve this problem. I've tried different architectures and hyperparameters but nothing seems to work. Can someone help me with this?

Answer: This is a classic problem of "traffic light control" which is a type of sequential decision-making problem. The goal is to learn a policy that maps the current state of the traffic lights (represented by the input vector) to the next state (represented by the output vector).

The problem you are facing is that the training data is not sufficient to learn an optimal policy. The reason for this is that the training data does not cover all possible states and transitions. In particular, there are many missing transitions in the training data, where the same input vector can lead to multiple possible output vectors.

To address this issue, you can try the following approaches:

1. Data augmentation: You can generate additional training data by applying random transformations to the existing training data, such as flipping, rotating, or adding noise. This can help increase the size of the training data and provide more coverage of the possible states and transitions.
2. Transfer learning: You can use pre-trained models that have been trained on similar problems, such as traffic light control problems from other cities or intersections. These models may have learned useful features and policies that can be adapted to your specific problem.
3. Ensemble methods: You can combine the predictions of multiple models, each trained on a different subset of the data, to improve the overall performance. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.
4. Simulation-based training: You can simulate the traffic light control problem using simulations, and use the simulated data to train the model. This can help generate more diverse and comprehensive training data, and also allow for more flexible exploration of the solution space.
5. Reinforcement learning: You can formulate the traffic light control problem as a reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns to take actions (e.g., change the traffic light color) based on the current state of the environment (i.e., the intersection). The agent receives rewards based on its actions, and the goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time. This approach can handle complex scenarios and adapt to changing conditions, but requires careful tuning of the reward function and exploration strategy.

These are just some suggestions, and the best approach will depend on the specific details of your problem and available resources.
