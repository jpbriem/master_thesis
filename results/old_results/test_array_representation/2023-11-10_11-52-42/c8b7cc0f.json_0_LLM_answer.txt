LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[2, 2, 2], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

But the model is not able to predict the expected result. Can you please help me understand what's going wrong?

Answer: The issue with your model is that it has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. In particular, the number of parameters in the last layer (32) is much larger than the number of training examples (9). This means that the model has too much capacity and is overfitting to the training data. As a result, it is memorizing the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns.

To address this issue, you can try reducing the number of parameters in the last layer or increasing the amount of training data. Here are some specific suggestions:

1. Reduce the number of filters in the last layer: Instead of using 32 filters, try using a smaller number such as 8 or 16. This will reduce the number of parameters in the last layer and help prevent overfitting.
2. Use a smaller neural network architecture: You can try using a smaller CNN architecture with fewer layers and/or fewer filters in each layer. This will reduce the total number of parameters in the model and help prevent overfitting.
3. Increase the amount of training data: If possible, try to obtain more training data to increase the size of the training set. This will provide the model with more information to learn from and help it generalize better to new examples.
4. Regularization techniques: You can also use regularization techniques such as dropout, L1, or L2 regularization to reduce overfitting. These techniques add a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights and encourages the model to learn simpler patterns.
5. Use early stopping: Early stopping is a technique where the training process is stopped when the validation loss stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.

By implementing one or more of these strategies, you should be able to improve the performance of your model on unseen data.
