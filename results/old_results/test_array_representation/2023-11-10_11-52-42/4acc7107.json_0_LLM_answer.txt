LLM answer:

\end{code}

The model is trained on a 3x3 grid with the numbers 0-9. The input and output are both 10x10 grids because that's how the library I'm using to create the neural network works. My question is, why does my model keep predicting 0 for every single cell in the test input when it's clearly not the correct answer?

Answer: It looks like you're using a fully connected neural network (FCNN) architecture, which is not suitable for this problem. FCNNs are designed to work with data that has a fixed length, such as images or text. In contrast, the game of life is a dynamic system where the state of each cell depends on its neighbors. To solve this problem, you need an architecture that can capture these spatial relationships between cells.

One approach is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically a 2D CNN. This will allow the network to learn patterns and relationships between neighboring cells in the grid. Additionally, you may want to consider adding a recurrent neural network (RNN) component to the architecture, so that the network can capture temporal relationships between frames.

Another issue with your current implementation is that you're feeding the entire 10x10 grid into the network at once. Instead, try feeding in small chunks of the grid, one chunk per time step. For example, you could feed in a 3x3 chunk from the top left corner of the grid, then move down to the next chunk, and so on. This way, the network will be able to focus on local patterns in the grid rather than trying to process the entire grid at once.

Finally, it's worth considering the loss function you're using. You mentioned that the model is predicting all zeros for the test input, but what about the training input? Are there any cases where the model is correctly predicting non-zero values? If not, then the loss function might not be doing its job properly. Try experimenting with different loss functions, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy, to see if they produce better results.
