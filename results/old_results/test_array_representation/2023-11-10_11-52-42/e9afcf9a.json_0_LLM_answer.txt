LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2], [2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6]]
```

In this example, we have a simple neural network with one hidden layer and a softmax output layer. The network takes in a 6-dimensional input vector and outputs a 6-dimensional output vector. The training data consists of two input-output pairs, where each input vector is paired with its corresponding output vector.

The first input vector is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is fed into the network to produce the output vector `[3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9]`. The second input vector is `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, which produces the output vector `[4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8]`.

During training, the network learns to map the input vectors to their corresponding output vectors. Once the network has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new input vectors that it hasn't seen before. In this case, the test input vector is `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]`, which the network maps to the output vector `[6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2]`.

Note that the output vector has the same dimension as the input vector, but the values are different. This is because the softmax function is applied element-wise to the output of the last layer, which gives us a probability distribution over all possible classes. In this case, the class with the highest probability for each input vector is the one that corresponds to the output vector.
