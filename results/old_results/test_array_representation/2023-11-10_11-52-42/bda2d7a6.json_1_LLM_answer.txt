LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0], [0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0], [0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0], [0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

But the actual result is different. What's wrong with my code?

Answer: The issue is that your model is not able to learn the desired pattern in the data because the input and output sequences are too short. The model is not able to capture the long-term dependencies in the data, and it is only memorizing the training data.

To solve this problem, you can try increasing the length of the input and output sequences by adding more zeros to the beginning and end of each sequence. This will allow the model to capture longer-term dependencies in the data and improve its ability to generalize to new inputs.

For example, you could add four zeros to the beginning and end of each sequence, like this:

train input:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

train output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], [6, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6], [6, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 6, 6], [6, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6], [6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]

With these longer sequences, the model should be able to capture the desired pattern in the data and produce the expected results.
