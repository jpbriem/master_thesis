LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9], [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9], [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9], [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9], [7, 7, 7, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 9, 9, 9]]

But the actual result is different. What's wrong?

Answer: The issue here is that the training data contains only a single example of each class (i.e., 5-tuples), and this is not enough for the model to learn the underlying patterns in the data. As a result, the model is unable to generalize well to new examples, leading to poor performance on the test set.

To address this, you could try increasing the number of training examples for each class, or using data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of the training set. Additionally, you may want to consider using a more complex model architecture, such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or a convolutional neural network (CNN), which can learn more complex patterns in the data.
