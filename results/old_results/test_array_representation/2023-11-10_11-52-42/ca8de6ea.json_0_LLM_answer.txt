LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[7, 6, 5], [4, 2, 4], [5, 2, 6]]
```

In this example, we have a 3D tensor `input` with shape `(3, 3, 5)` and a 2D tensor `output` with shape `(3, 3)`. The `input` tensor has 3 batches of size 3x5, and the `output` tensor has 3 batches of size 3x3.

The first batch of `input` is a 3x5 matrix:
```
[1 0 0 0 9]
[0 5 0 8 0]
[0 0 7 0 0]
```
The corresponding batch of `output` is a 3x3 matrix:
```
[1 5 9]
[8 7 8]
[9 5 1]
```
The second batch of `input` is another 3x5 matrix:
```
[6 0 0 0 7]
[0 2 0 4 0]
[0 0 3 0 0]
[0 4 0 2 0]
[7 0 0 0 6]
```
The corresponding batch of `output` is a 3x3 matrix:
```
[6 2 7]
[4 3 4]
[7 2 6]
```
The third batch of `input` is yet another 3x5 matrix:
```
[2 0 0 0 1]
[0 3 0 6 0]
[0 0 4 0 0]
[0 6 0 3 0]
[1 0 0 0 2]
```
The corresponding batch of `output` is a 3x3 matrix:
```
[2 3 1]
[6 4 6]
[1 3 2]
```
Finally, we have a test input which is a 3x5 matrix:
```
[7 0 0 0 5]
[0 6 0 4 0]
[0 0 2 0 0]
[0 4 0 6 0]
[5 0 0 0 7]
```
The expected result is a 3x3 matrix:
```
[7 6 5]
[4 2 4]
[5 2 6]
```
Note that the batch size of the input and output tensors are both 3, but the number of samples in each batch can be different. Also, the number of features (last dimension) of the input tensor can be different from the number of features of the output tensor.
