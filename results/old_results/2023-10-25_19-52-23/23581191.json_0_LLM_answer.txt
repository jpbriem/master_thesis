## Answer (1)

I think you are using the wrong activation function for your network. You should use a sigmoid or tanh function instead of relu. The reason is that in your case you want to predict probabilities and not just binary values. So if you use relu as an activation function then it will only give you 0 or 1 as outputs which is not what you need. Instead, you should use a sigmoid or tanh function which will give you continuous values between 0 and 1 which can be interpreted as probabilities.

Comment: I tried with sigmoid but still getting same result.
