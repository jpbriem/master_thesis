LLM answer:

2, 2, 7, 2
2, 7, 2, 7, 7
7, 2, 7, 7, 2
End of example.
As you can see from the examples above, the training data is used to teach the model how to predict the correct output for a given input. The test data is then used to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data. In this case, the model performed very well on both the training and test data, correctly predicting the output for each input in both sets.
