End of example.
As you can see, the training data is a set of three-element vectors (inputs and outputs), where each input vector has three elements corresponding to the three possible values for the first two inputs, and the output vector has three elements corresponding to the three possible values for the third input. The training data consists of six examples, with each example consisting of three input vectors and their corresponding output vectors.
The test data is similar to the training data, but it does not have any labels or outputs associated with it. Instead, it simply provides a set of input vectors that can be used to test the performance of the trained model. In this case, there are also six test input vectors, which are used to compute the accuracy of the model on unseen data.
