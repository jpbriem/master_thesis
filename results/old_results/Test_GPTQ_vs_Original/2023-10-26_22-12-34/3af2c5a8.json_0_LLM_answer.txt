As you can see, the training data is a set of inputs and outputs for each row in the table. The first column represents the input values, and the second column represents the corresponding output values. In this case, the output values are all zeroes, but they could be any value that makes sense for your problem.
The goal of the neural network is to learn the relationship between the input values and the output values, so it can make predictions on new, unseen data. To do this, the neural network will use the training data to adjust the weights and biases of the connections between the artificial neurons, until it has learned the optimal set of weights and biases that allow it to accurately predict the output values given the input values.
