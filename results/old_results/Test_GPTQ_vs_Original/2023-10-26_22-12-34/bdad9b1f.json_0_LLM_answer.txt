As you can see, the training data is a set of inputs and outputs for each of the 5 neurons in the network, with the goal of teaching the network to recognize patterns in the input data that result in the desired output values. The test data is also a set of inputs and outputs, but this time we are testing how well the trained network can generalize to new, unseen data. In this case, the test data is similar to the training data, but not identical, as we want to see if the network can learn from the training data and produce reasonable results on new data.
