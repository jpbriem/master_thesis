It seems that the model is able to predict the output values correctly for both training and test inputs, but it's not able to generalize well on new unseen data (test set). This is a common problem in machine learning, where models can perform well on the training data but fail to do so on real-world data.
To address this issue, you could try different preprocessing techniques, such as normalization or feature scaling, or use more advanced techniques like transfer learning or ensemble methods. Additionally, you may want to consider using a different model architecture or increasing the size of your dataset to improve the model's ability to generalize.
