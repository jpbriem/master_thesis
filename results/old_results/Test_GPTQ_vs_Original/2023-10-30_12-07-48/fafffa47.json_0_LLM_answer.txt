Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same input and output. The third example has a different input but the same output as the second example. The fourth example has a different input and output than all three previous examples.

## Answer (3)

The problem is that your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

Comment: Thanks for the answer! I tried adding L1 regularization with alpha = 0.01 and it didn't help much. I will try L2 regularization next.
