Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same as the training data". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The training and testing data have the same format. They both contain a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers between 0 and 9.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training set. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to see if it helps with overfitting.
