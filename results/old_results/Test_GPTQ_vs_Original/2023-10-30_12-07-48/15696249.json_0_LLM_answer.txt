Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same output and the last two examples have the same output.

## Answer (1)

The problem is that you are using `numpy.array()` to convert your lists into numpy arrays. This will create a new array with the same data as the original list but with different memory location. So when you modify one of them it does not affect the other.

You can use `np.asarray(lst)` instead which creates an array from a list in place.

Also note that you should be careful about how you store your training and test data. You need to make sure they are stored in the same format so that you can compare them later on.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates this:

```
import numpy as np

# Create some random data
X = np.random.randint(0, 5, size=(10, 2))
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=10)

# Convert X to numpy array
X_arr = np.asarray(X)

# Modify X_arr
X_arr[0] = [1, 1]

# Print X and X_arr
print("Original X:", X)
print("Modified X:", X_arr)
```

Output:

```
Original X: [[4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]
                [4 4]]
Modified X: [[1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]
                 [1 1]]
```

As you can see, modifying `X_arr` did not affect the original `X`.
