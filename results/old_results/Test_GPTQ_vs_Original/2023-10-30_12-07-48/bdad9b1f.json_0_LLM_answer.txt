Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The second two examples also have the same input and output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def predict(input_data):
    # create a dictionary with all possible values of x and y
    X = {0: [0], 1: [1]}
    Y = {0: [0], 1: [1]}

    # loop through each row in the training data
    for i in range(len(training)):
        # check if the current row has an x value of 0 or 1
        if training[i][0] == 0:
            # add the current row to the dictionary of x=0 rows
            X[0].append(training[i])
        else:
            # add the current row to the dictionary of x=1 rows
            X[1].append(training[i])

    # loop through each row in the test data
    for i in range(len(testing)):
        # check if the current row has an x value of 0 or 1
        if testing[i][0] == 0:
            # use the x=0 rows to make predictions
            return np.array([predict_x0(row) for row in X[0]])
        else:
            # use the x=1 rows to make predictions
            return np.array([predict_x1(row) for row in X[1]])

def predict_x0(row):
    # check if the current row has a y value of 0 or 1
    if row[1] == 0:
        # return 0
        return 0
    else:
        # return 1
        return 1

def predict_x1(row):
    # check if the current row has a y value of 0 or 1
    if row[1] == 0:
        # return 1
        return 1
    else:
        # return 0
        return 0
```

This code should work as follows:

- First, it creates two dictionaries `X` and `Y`, which will be used to store the rows from the training data that have either an `x` value of 0 or 1.
- Then, it loops through each row in the training data and checks whether its `x` value is 0 or 1. If it is 0, then it adds the row to the `X[0]` dictionary; otherwise, it adds the row to the `X[1]` dictionary.
- Next, it loops through each row in the test data and checks whether its `x` value is 0 or 1. If it is 0, then it uses the rows in the `X[0]` dictionary to make predictions using the `predict_x0()` function; otherwise, it uses the rows in the `X[1]` dictionary to make predictions using the `predict_x1()` function.
- Finally, the `predict()` function returns the predicted outputs for each row in the test data.

Note that this code assumes that the `training` and `testing` lists contain tuples with two elements: the `x` value and the `y` value. Also note that the `predict_x0()` and `predict_x1()` functions simply return the corresponding `y` value for each row based on whether its `x` value is 0 or 1.
