Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same as the training data". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JonasE.K. I have added an example to my question. The test inputs and outputs are the same as the corresponding training inputs and outputs.

## Answer (3)

The problem is that your model is overfitting on the training set. You can try using a different model or hyperparameters.

For instance, you could use a neural network with more hidden layers and neurons in each layer. Or you could use a different activation function such as ReLU instead of sigmoid.

You could also try using regularization techniques like L1/L2 regularization or dropout.

Comment: Thanks for your answer! I tried using a neural network with one hidden layer and sigmoid activation function but it didn't work. I will try using ReLU activation function and see if it works.
