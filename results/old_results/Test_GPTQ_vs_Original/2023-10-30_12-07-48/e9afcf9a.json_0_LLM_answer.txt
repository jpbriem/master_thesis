Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a value that is different from the training data then it will be wrong.

Comment: @MichaelChurchill Yes, but in this case, the test data is also different than the training data. So, how can we make the model learn something useful?

## Answer (1)

The problem with your code is that you are using `np.array([[0, 0], [0, 0]])` for the first two inputs and `np.array([[0, 0], [0, 0]])` for the last two inputs. This means that the model is only learning one set of weights and biases. You need to use different sets of weights and biases for each set of inputs.

You could do this by creating a loop that iterates over all possible pairs of inputs and outputs, and then using those pairs to train the model. Here is an example implementation:

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Define the function to generate random data
def generate_data(n):
    return np.random.randint(0, n, size=(n, 2))

# Generate some random data
X = generate_data(10)
y = np.zeros((10, 1))

# Train the model on all possible pairs of inputs and outputs
for i in range(len(X)):
    X_train = np.array([[X[i, :-1], y[i]]])
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train)
    print("Training on:", X[i, :-1], "->", y[i])
    # Make predictions on the remaining inputs
    X_test = np.delete(X, i, axis=0)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print("Predicting on:", X_test, "->", y_pred)
```

This should produce output similar to the following:

```

Predicting on: [[6 6] -> 12.
                     [7 8] -> 12.
