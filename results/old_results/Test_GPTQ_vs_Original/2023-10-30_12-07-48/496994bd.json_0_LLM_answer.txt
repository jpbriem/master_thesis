Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". If you want to predict on a test set that is different from the training set, then you need to split your data into training and testing sets before training your model. You can use scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function for this purpose.

## Answer (1)

You are using the wrong approach. The correct way to do it would be to split your dataset into training and testing sets. Then you can train your model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

Here is an example of how you could do this in Python with scikit-learn:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load your data
data = load_data()
X = data['features']
y = data['target']

# Split your data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train your logistic regression model on the training set
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the performance of your model on the testing set
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print('Test score:', score)
```
