Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third example has a different input but the same output as the first two. The fourth example has a different input and output than the previous three.

## Answer (3)

The problem is that your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

Comment: Thanks for the answer! I tried adding L1 regularization with alpha = 0.01 and it didn't help much. I also tried using k-fold cross validation with k=5 and it didn't improve performance either. Do you have any other suggestions?
