Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples in your answer are identical to the first two examples in my question.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def predict(X):
    # Get the number of features and samples
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    n_samples = X.shape[0]

    # Create an empty array to store the predictions
    y_pred = np.zeros((n_samples, n_features))

    # Loop through each feature
    for i in range(n_features):
        # Get the current feature
        feature = X[:,i]

        # Fit a linear regression model on the training data
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X_train, y_train[:,i])

        # Make predictions using the fitted model
        y_pred[:,i] = model.predict(X)

    return y_pred
```

This code will loop through each feature in `X`, fit a linear regression model on the training data, and make predictions using that model. It then returns an array with one row per sample and one column per feature containing the predicted values.

Note that this approach assumes that all features are independent of each other. If they are correlated, it may be better to use a more sophisticated model such as a neural network or decision tree.
