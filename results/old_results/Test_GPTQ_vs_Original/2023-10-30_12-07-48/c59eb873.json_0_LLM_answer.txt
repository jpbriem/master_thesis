Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the second example.

## Answer (4)

The problem is that your `predict_output` function does not return anything. You need to add a return statement at the end of it.

Also, in your `predict_output` function, you are using `return` statements inside loops. This will cause an infinite loop because each time you call `predict_output`, it will keep calling itself until it reaches the end of the loop.

You can fix this by returning the final result from the `predict_output` function instead of using `return` statements inside loops.

Here is how you could modify your code to fix these issues:

```
def predict_output(input):
    # Your logic here
    return output

def train(inputs, outputs):
    for i in range(len(inputs)):
        output = predict_output(inputs[i])
        if output!= outputs[i]:
            print("Error:", output, outputs[i], inputs[i])

def test(inputs):
    outputs = []
    for i in range(len(inputs)):
        output = predict_output(inputs[i])
        outputs.append(output)
    return outputs
```

Note that I also removed the `print` statements from your `train` and `test` functions since they were just printing out the input/output pairs without actually doing anything with them.
