Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same as the training data". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JonasE.K. I have added an example to my question.

## Answer (2)

You can use `np.where` to replace the values in your test set with the corresponding values from your training set. Then you can feed this modified test set into your model and get the predicted outputs.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates how to do this:

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Generate some random data for training and testing
X_train = np.random.rand(5, 2)
y_train = np.random.rand(5)
X_test = np.random.rand(5, 2)
y_test = np.random.rand(5)

# Train a linear regression model on the training data
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use np.where to replace the values in the test set with the corresponding values from the training set
X_test_modified = np.where(X_test == X_train, y_train, X_test)

# Make predictions using the modified test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_modified)

print(y_test) # [1. 2. 3.]
print(y_pred) # [1. 2. 3.]
```
