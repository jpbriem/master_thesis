Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two inputs and outputs are identical to the third two inputs and outputs.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer depends on how much complexity you want your model to have. If you only need it to learn simple patterns then 2-3 neurons should be enough. But if you need it to learn more complex patterns then you may need more than that.

You can also try using a convolutional neural network or a recurrent neural network depending on the nature of your data.
