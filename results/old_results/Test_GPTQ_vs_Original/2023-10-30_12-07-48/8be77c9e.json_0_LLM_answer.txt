Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

## Answer (2)

The problem is that you are using `np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]])` as your training data. This means that you have only one sample in your training set. You need to add more samples to your training set for it to be useful.

You can do this by creating a numpy array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and `n_features` is the number of features. Then you can use `np.random.randint()` or some other method to fill in random values for each feature in each sample.

Here's an example:

```
import numpy as np

# create a numpy array with shape (2, 3)
X = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(2, 3))
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=2)

print(X)
print(y)
```

This will print out two arrays like this:

```
[[1 1 1]
 [0 0 0]]

[1 1]
```

Note that these arrays have three features because we specified `size=(3,)`. If you want to specify a different number of features, just change the second argument to the desired value.
