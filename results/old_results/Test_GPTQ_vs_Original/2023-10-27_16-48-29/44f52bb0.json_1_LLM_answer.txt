## C[edit]

This is a simple implementation that uses the fact that the number of ways to place two rooks on an n×n chessboard without attacking each other is equal to the number of ways to place n−1 non-attacking rooks on an (n−1)×(n−1) chessboard. The latter can be computed by recursion using the formula given in the problem statement.

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Number of solutions for %dx%d board: %d\n", n, n, n * (n - 1));
}
```

## C++[edit]

### Recursive solution[edit]

The following code implements the recursive solution described above. It also prints out all possible placements of the rooks.

```
// A C++ program to print all possible positions of Rooks on NxN Chess Board
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function to print all possible positions of Rooks on NxN Chess Board
void printRookPositions(int n)
{
    // Base Case
    if (n == 1)
        return;

    // Print all possible positions of Rooks on (n-1)*(n-1) Chess Board
    printRookPositions(n - 1);

    // Place first Rook at leftmost column
    cout << "Place First Rook at Leftmost Column" << endl;

    // Place second Rook at rightmost column
    cout << "Place Second Rook at Rightmost Column" << endl;

    // Print all possible positions of Rooks on (n-1)*(n-1) Chess Board
    printRookPositions(n - 1);
}

// Driver Code
int main()
{
    int n = 3;
    printRookPositions(n);
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```

Place Second Rook at Rightmost Column
Place First Rook at Leftmost Column
Place Second Rook at Rightmost Column
