As you can see, the training and test inputs are all zeroes, but the training output is different from the test output. This means that the model has learned something during training, even though there is no data in the training set.

In general, it's a good idea to have some non-zero values in the training set, so that the model can learn from them. However, if you don't have any real data to use for training, then using only zeroes as inputs can still be useful for testing the basic functionality of the model.
