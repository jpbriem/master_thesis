## Answer (1)

I think you're overthinking this a bit. You don't need to do anything special for the `for` loop; just use it as normal. The only thing that needs to be different is how you handle the inputs and outputs.

For your inputs, you can just have an array of arrays. For each training example, you would have one row in the array with all the values for that example. So if you had three examples, you would have three rows in the array. Each row would contain seven elements, corresponding to the seven values in each example.

For your outputs, you could also just have an array of arrays. But since there are only two possible outputs per example, you might want to make them into a single-dimensional array instead. Then you could index into the array using the same indices as you used for the inputs.

Comment: I tried to implement what you said but I am getting error "IndexError: list assignment index out of range" when running my code. I will post my updated code below.

Comment: @user3579843 That means you've got something wrong somewhere else. It doesn't look like you've posted any code that actually uses the `for` loop.
