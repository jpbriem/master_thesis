LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0
4, 9, 8, 0, 9, 6
4, 0, 9, 8, 0, 6
4, 0, 9, 0, 6, 6
4, 8, 1, 0, 8, 6
0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0
End of example.
Note that the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as arrays of integers, where each integer represents a feature value (either 0 or 1) for one of the examples in the training set. The `train` output is also an array of integers representing the predicted class label for each example in the training set. Similarly, the `test` output is an array of integers representing the predicted class label for each example in the test set.
