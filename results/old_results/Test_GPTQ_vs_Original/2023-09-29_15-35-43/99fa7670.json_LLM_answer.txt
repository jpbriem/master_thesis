LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
Note that the last column of both the input and output matrices represents the predicted value for each sample in the test set. In this case, all samples have a predicted value of 8, indicating that the model has learned to recognize the pattern in the training data and can accurately predict the output values for new inputs.
