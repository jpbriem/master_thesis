LLM answer for tasks 1:
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.

As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain 0s and 1s), and the corresponding outputs are also binary vectors. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how a neural network can be trained on binary data, and how it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen binary data.
