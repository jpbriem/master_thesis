LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0
0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 2, 0
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0
0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training data is much simpler than the test data. The training data consists only of simple patterns like "0, 0, 0, 4" or "0, 3, 0, 4", while the test data contains more complex patterns like "1, 0, 0, 4" or "0, 1, 1, 4". This is because the model is trained to recognize simple patterns and then tested on more complex ones to evaluate its performance.
