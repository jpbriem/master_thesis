The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 3). Each subsequent line contains a single example as input, with each feature on a separate line and separated by spaces. The last line of the `train` file is blank.

The first line of the `test` file contains the number of examples in the test set (in this case, 3), followed by three lines of input data for the test set. As before, each feature is on a separate line and separated by spaces. The last line of the `test` file is also blank.
