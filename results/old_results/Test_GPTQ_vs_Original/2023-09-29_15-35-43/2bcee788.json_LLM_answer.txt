LLM answer for tasks 1:
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
End of example.
\end{code}

As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain values of 0 or 1), and the training outputs are always 3. The test outputs are a mix of 3s and non-3s, depending on whether the corresponding input vector has a 1 in the last position.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
