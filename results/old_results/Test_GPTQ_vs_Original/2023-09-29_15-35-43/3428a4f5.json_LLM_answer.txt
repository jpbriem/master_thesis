LLM answer for tasks 1:
3, 3, 3, 3, 3
End of example.
Note that the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output (i.e., the correct answer). This is because the model has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data, and it can apply those patterns to new, unseen data (like the test data) to make accurate predictions.
