LLM answer for tasks 1:
1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of samples in the training set, followed by the corresponding inputs and outputs. Each input is a vector of integers representing the values of the features for that sample, and each output is a vector of integers representing the predicted class labels for that sample. The format of the data files is as follows:

* Each input vector has the same length (equal to the number of features).
* Each output vector has the same length (equal to the number of classes).
* The values in the input vectors are non-negative and sum to at most $n$.
* The values in the output vectors are either $0$ or $1$.

For example, in the first training sample, the input vector is $(1, 0, 0)$, which corresponds to the feature values for the first sample in the test set. The output vector is $(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$, which represents the predicted class labels for that sample.

The `test` file contains a single line with three integers representing the inputs for a single test case. These inputs are used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data.
