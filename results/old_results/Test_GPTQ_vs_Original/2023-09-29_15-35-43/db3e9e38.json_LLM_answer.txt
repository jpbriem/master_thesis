LLM answer for tasks 1:
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training data is used to learn the weights and biases for the neural network, and then the learned model is tested on a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance. In this case, the test set consists of 10 examples, each with an input vector and a corresponding output vector. The output vectors are all binary values (0 or 1), indicating whether the corresponding input vector belongs to one of the two classes in the problem.
The neural network has learned to recognize patterns in the input data that correspond to the class labels in the output data. For example, in the first training example, the input vector [0, 0, 0, 7] corresponds to the output label 8, because the neural network has learned to recognize a pattern in the input data that indicates the presence of the class label 8. Similarly, in the second training example, the input vector [0, 0, 7, 0] corresponds to the output label 7, etc.
In summary, the goal of supervised learning is to use labeled training data to teach a machine learning algorithm how to make predictions about new, unseen data based on patterns it has learned from the training data.
