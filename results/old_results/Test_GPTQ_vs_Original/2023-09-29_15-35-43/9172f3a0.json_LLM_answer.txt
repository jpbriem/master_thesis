LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 8). Each subsequent line specifies a single example, with each value separated by a space. The values are represented as integers, and they range from -5 to 5 inclusive.

The first column of the `train` file corresponds to the input features for the first example, and so on. For example, the first example has three input features: `3`, `3`, and `0`. The second example has four input features: `7`, `4`, `0`, and `0`.

The corresponding output values for each example are also provided in the `train` file. These values are also represented as integers, and they range from 0 to 5 inclusive.

The `test` file is similar to the `train` file, but it only contains five examples instead of eight. As before, each line specifies a single example, with each value separated by a space. However, unlike the `train` file, the `test` file does not contain any output values. Instead, it simply provides a set of test inputs that can be used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
