3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
End of example.
As you can see, the model is able to predict the correct output for each test input in this example.
