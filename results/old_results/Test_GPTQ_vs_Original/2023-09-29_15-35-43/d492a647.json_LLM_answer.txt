End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are different from each other. The training data contains more examples with a higher frequency of occurrence of the class label "5", while the test data has a more balanced distribution of classes. This is done to prevent overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in recognizing the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data.
