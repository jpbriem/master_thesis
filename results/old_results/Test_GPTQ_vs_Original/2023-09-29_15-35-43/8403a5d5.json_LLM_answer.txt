As you can see, the `train` and `test` inputs are just random numbers, but the `train` output is different from the `test` output. This means that the neural network has learned something during training, even though it hasn't seen any real data.

In this example, the neural network has learned to recognize a pattern in the random input data, and it outputs `1` for any input that contains the same pattern as the training data. This is not surprising, since the neural network has been trained on random data, and it will likely produce random output values if given random input.

In practice, you will want to use more complex and structured data for training your neural network, rather than just random numbers. The goal is to teach the neural network to recognize patterns in the data that are relevant for the problem you are trying to solve.
