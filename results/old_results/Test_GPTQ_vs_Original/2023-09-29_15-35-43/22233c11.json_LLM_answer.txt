As you can see, the training and test inputs are all zeroes, but the training output is different from the test output. This means that the model has learned something during training, even though there is no data in the training set.

It's important to note that this is a very simple example, and in real-world scenarios, you would not want to use a dataset with only two examples per class. You should always try to use as much data as possible for each class, so that the model can learn to recognize the differences between them more accurately.
