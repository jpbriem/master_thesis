End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are different from each other. The training data contains more examples of the class "5" than any other class, while the test data has a higher proportion of examples belonging to the class "9". This is because the model was trained on a dataset that had a bias towards the class "5", but then tested on a dataset that had a different distribution of classes.
