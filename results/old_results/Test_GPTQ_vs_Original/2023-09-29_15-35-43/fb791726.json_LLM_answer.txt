As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output when run through the neural network. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize the patterns in the data, regardless of whether it's a training or test input. The goal of training a neural network is to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs that generalizes well to new, unseen data (like the test inputs).
