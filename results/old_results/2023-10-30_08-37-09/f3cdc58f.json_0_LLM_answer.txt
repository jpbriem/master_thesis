Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the model is overfitting". What do you expect the model to look like?

Comment: @JonSG I mean that the model is too complex and it fits the training data very well but when I test it on new data it doesn't work as expected.

## Answer (1)

I think your problem is in the way you are splitting the data. You are using `train_test_split()` from scikit-learn which splits the data randomly. This means that if you run this code multiple times with different random seeds, you will get different results.

You should use a more sophisticated method for splitting the data such as k-fold cross validation. This will ensure that each fold contains roughly equal amounts of samples from each class.

Here is an example of how you can split the data using k-fold cross validation:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
X_train, y_train = [], []
for train_index, val_index in kf.split(X):
    X_train += X[train_index]
    y_train += y[train_index]
    X_val += X[val_index]
    y_val += y[val_index]
```

This will give you 5 folds of data where each fold has roughly equal amounts of samples from each class.
