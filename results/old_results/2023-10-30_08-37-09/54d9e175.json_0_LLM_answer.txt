Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same model". You have two different models here. The first one is a linear regression model and the second one is a neural network. They are very different models.

## Answer (1)

The reason for this is that your neural network has no activation function. In other words, it is just a linear combination of its inputs. This means that if you feed in the same values to the network, it will always give out the same output.

To fix this, you need to add an activation function to each neuron in your network. For example, you could use the sigmoid function.

Here is some sample code using TensorFlow to create a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing three neurons, each with a sigmoid activation function:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define the model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(units=3, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(2,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model on some data
x = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
y = [0, 1, 1, 0]
model.fit(x, y, epochs=100)

# Evaluate the model on some more data
x_test = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
print(y_pred)
```

This should produce something like:

```
[[0.        ]
 [0.        ]
 [0.        ]
 [0.        ]]
```

Note that the `activation='sigmoid'` argument specifies that we want to use the sigmoid function for each neuron in the dense layers. If you want to use a different activation function, you can replace `'sigmoid'` with whatever you prefer.
