Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the0" and "these are not". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (1)

I think your problem is that you are using `np.array` to create a numpy array from your list of lists. This creates a 3D array with shape `(1, 4, 5)`. You can see this by printing out the shape of your array:
```
print(X.shape)
# Output: (1, 4, 5)
```
To fix this, you need to flatten your array into a 2D array before passing it to `model.predict`. You can do this using `np.reshape`:

```
X = np.reshape(X, (-1, 9))
```
This will reshape your array into a 2D array with shape `(-1, 9)`, where `-1` means that the size of the first dimension will be determined automatically based on the size of the other dimensions.

You should also make sure that your target variable has the same shape as your input data. In your case, since your input data is a 2D array with shape `(-1, 9)`, your target variable should also have shape `(-1, 1)`. If your target variable does not have the correct shape, you may get an error when trying to predict.
