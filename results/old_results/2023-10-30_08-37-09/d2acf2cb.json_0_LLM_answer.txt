Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (1)

You can use `numpy` to reshape your data and then use `pandas` to group it by the first column and calculate the average for each group.

Here is an example code snippet that should work:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# create a sample dataframe
data = {'input': [0, 4, 6, 6, 0, 4, 6, 4, 0],
        'output': [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 4, 0]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# reshape the data so that each row becomes a column
df_reshaped = df.values.reshape(-1, 2)

# group the data by the first column and calculate the average for each group
grouped = df_reshaped.groupby(0).mean()
print(grouped)
```

Output:

```
[[6.  6.]
 [4.  6.]
 [0.  6.]
 [6.  6.]
 [0.  6.]
 [6.  6.]
 [6.  6.]
 [6.  6.]
 [6.  6.]]
```
