Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict the same values for the test set as you did for the training set, then you can just use the model on the test set and it will do that. But if you want to predict different values than you did for the training set, then you need a new model trained on the test set.

## Answer (1)

You have two options here:

- Train your model on the entire dataset (training + testing). This is the most common approach in machine learning. You should be careful though because this could lead to overfitting.
- Train your model on the training set only and then evaluate its performance on the testing set. This is also a common approach but you should make sure that your model generalizes well enough to the testing set.

In both cases, you should split your dataset into training and testing sets before training/evaluating your model.
