Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (1)

You can use `numpy` to create a matrix with your data and then use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to compute the distance matrix. Then you can use `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` to generate some random labels for each sample. Finally, you can use `sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` to compute the pairwise distances between samples based on their labels.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

# Generate some random data
X = np.random.rand(10, 2)

# Compute the distance matrix using hierarchical clustering
Z = AgglomerativeClustering().fit_predict(X)
d = pairwise_distances(Z, metric='euclidean')

# Generate some random labels
labels = make_classification(n_samples=len(X), n_classes=3, random_state=42).labels_

# Compute the pairwise distances between samples based on their labels
d_labels = pairwise_distances(labels, metric='euclidean')

print(d)
print(d_labels)
```

Output:

```
