Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict the next value in a sequence, then you need to have a model that can take into account the previous values. You could use an LSTM or GRU for this task.

## Answer (1)

You are using a simple linear regression model which is not suitable for time series prediction. For time series prediction you should use a recurrent neural network (RNN). There are many RNN models available such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), etc.

Here is some sample code using Keras and Tensorflow with LSTM:

```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, LSTM
import numpy as np

# Generate random data
n_samples = 100
n_features = 1
n_steps = 4
time_step = 1

X, y = [], []
for i in range(n_samples):
    x = [np.random.randint(0, 10, size=n_steps)]
    y.append(x[-1])
    X.append(x[:-1])
    
# Convert data to numpy array
X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Reshape data to be 3D array of batch_size, timesteps, features
X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], 1, n_steps))

# Create model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(n_steps, n_features)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

# Train model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Make predictions on test data
test_data = [[5, 6, 7]]
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
print(predictions)
```
