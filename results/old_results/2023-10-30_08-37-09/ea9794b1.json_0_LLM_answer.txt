Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The two examples have the same input and output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for `numpy`. You can use `np.array()` to convert your lists into numpy arrays, then use `np.where()` to create a mask based on the condition in your question. Finally, you can use `np.multiply()` to multiply the array with the mask.

Here's an example:

```
import numpy as np

# sample data
data = [
    [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0],
    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3],
    [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],
    [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0],
    [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],
    [0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
    [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8]
]

# convert lists to numpy arrays
arrays = [[x[i] for i in range(len(x)) if x[i]!= 0] for x in data]
masks = [[x[i] == 0 for i in range(len(x))] for x in data]

# multiply arrays with masks
result = np.array(arrays).dot(np.array(masks))
print(result)
```

Output:

```
[[ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]
 [ 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2]]
```
