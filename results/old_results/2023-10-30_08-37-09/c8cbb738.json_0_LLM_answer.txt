Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict on test data that is different from the training data, then you need a model that can generalize well. You should try using a more complex model (e.g., one with more layers or more neurons per layer) and see if it improves performance.

## Answer (0)

I think your problem is in the way you are splitting your dataset. You are using `train_test_split` but you are not specifying the ratio between train and test set. So, you are getting two datasets with the same number of samples. This means that your model will be overfitting because it has too much information about the training set.

You should specify the ratio between train and test set when calling `train_test_split`. For example, you could use `train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)` which would split your dataset into 80% train and 20% test sets.
