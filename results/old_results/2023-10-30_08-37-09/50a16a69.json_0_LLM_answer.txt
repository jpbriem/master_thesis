Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a sequence that is different from any in your training set, then you need to use a model trained on a larger dataset (or one with more diversity).

## Answer (0)

I think you are using the wrong approach for this problem. You should be using a recurrent neural network (RNN), such as LSTM or GRU. These models are designed specifically for sequential data and can handle variable length sequences.

You can find some good tutorials online about how to implement these models in Python using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
