Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the8" and "these are 8". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @MichaelHampton I have edited my question to make it clearer.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def get_output(input):
    # convert input string into list of integers
    input = [int(x) for x in input]

    # create empty dictionary with keys as unique values from input list
    output = {}
    for val in set(input):
        output[val] = 0

    # iterate over input list
    for i in range(len(input)):
        # check if current value already exists in output dictionary
        if output[input[i]] == 0:
            # increment count of current value
            output[input[i]] += 1
        else:
            # increment count of current value and add new key-value pair to output dictionary
            output[input[i]] += 1
            output[input[i]] = output[input[i]] - output[input[i]] + 1

    return output
```

This function takes an integer list as input and returns a dictionary where each key represents a unique value from the input list and its corresponding value is the number of times that value appears in the input list. If there are multiple occurrences of a single value, then the value associated with that key will be greater than one.

Here's how you can use this function on your test cases:

```
# test case 1
print(get_output([1, 2, 3, 4]))
# expected output: {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}

# test case 2
print(get_output([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))
# expected output: {5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 2}

# test case 3
print(get_output([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1,
