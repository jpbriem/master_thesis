Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

## Answer (3)

The problem is that your `train_output` and `test_output` are different. You have to change them accordingly.

For example, if you want to predict a class with 5 possible values, then your `train_output` should be a matrix of size `(n_samples, n_classes)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples in your training set and `n_classes` is the number of classes. Similarly, your `test_output` should also be a matrix of size `(n_samples, n_classes)`.

If you don't know the exact number of classes beforehand, you can use one-hot encoding or some other method to encode your labels as vectors. Then you can feed these encoded vectors into your model and it will learn to distinguish between the different classes.

Solution:
0, 2, 2
2, 2, 2
2, 0, 2
