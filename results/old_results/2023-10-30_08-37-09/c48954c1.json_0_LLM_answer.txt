Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def get_output(input):
    if len(input) == 1:
        return [input[0]]
    else:
        # split the input into two parts
        first = input[:len(input)/2]
        second = input[len(input)/2:]
        # recursively call function on each part and concatenate results
        result = []
        for x in get_output(first):
            for y in get_output(second):
                result.append([x,y])
        return result
```

This function works by splitting the input into two halves, calling itself recursively on each half, and then concatenating the results together. This way it can handle any number of inputs.
