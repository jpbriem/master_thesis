Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (2)

The problem is that your `train_output` and `test_output` are not in the same format. In the first case, they are lists of integers representing the class labels for each sample. In the second case, they are strings indicating whether a given sample belongs to the positive or negative class.

To fix this, you need to convert your `test_output` into a list of integers before comparing it with `train_output`. You can do this using the following code:

```
test_output = [int(x == 'positive') for x in test_output]
```

This will create a new list where `True` values are converted to `1`, and `False` values are converted to `0`. Now you should be able to compare `test_output` with `train_output` without any issues.
