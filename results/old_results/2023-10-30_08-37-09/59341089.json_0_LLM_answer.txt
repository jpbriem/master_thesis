Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a sequence that is different from any in your training set, then you need to use a model trained on all possible sequences (i.e., an infinite number of examples). Otherwise, you are essentially trying to memorize the training data and will fail when presented with anything new.

## Answer (1)

You can try using a recurrent neural network (RNN), such as LSTM or GRU. These models are designed for sequential data and should be able to handle this problem. You can also try using a convolutional neural network (CNN) if you have enough data.
