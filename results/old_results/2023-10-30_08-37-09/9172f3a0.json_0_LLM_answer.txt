Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same input and output. The third example has a different input but the same output as the second example.

## Answer (1)

You can use `groupby()` to group your dataframe by the first column and then apply `apply()` with `lambda` function to each group.

Here is an example code snippet that should work for you:

```
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': ['a', 'b', 'c']})

# Group by A and apply lambda function on B
result = df.groupby('A')['B'].apply(lambda x: x[x == x.iloc[0]])
print(result)
```

Output:

```
A
1   b
2   c
Name: B, dtype: object
```

In this case, we want to keep only the first value in each group. So we compare each element with its first value using `==`. If it is true, we keep it otherwise we drop it.
