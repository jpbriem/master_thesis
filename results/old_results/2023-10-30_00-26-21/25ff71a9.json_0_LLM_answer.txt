Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are the same in that they both have a single `1` and no other `1`s. But the third is different because it has two `1`s. And the fourth is different from all three because it has no `1`s at all. So there are four distinct cases here.

Answer: You can use [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) to generate all possible combinations of inputs and outputs for your training data. Then you can use this list as an argument to your neural network model to get predictions on unseen data.

For example, if we had the following training data:

\begin{code}
training_data = [[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]],
                 [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]],
                 [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]]
\end{code}

We could create all possible combinations using itertools like so:

\begin{code}
from itertools import product

all_combinations = []
for x, y, z in product(*training_data):
    all_combinations.append([x, y, z])
\end{code}

This would give us the following list:

\begin{code}
[[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)], [(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)], [(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)]]
\end{code}

Now we can feed these combinations into our neural network model to get predictions on unseen data. For example, let's say we have the following model:

\begin{code}
model = Model()
\end{code}

Then we can make predictions on new data like so:

\begin{code}
predictions = model.predict(all_combinations)
\end{code}

Which will return something like this:

\begin{code}
array([[-0.5467, -0.8967,  0.        ],
       [-0.5467, -0.8967,  0.        ]])
\end{code}
