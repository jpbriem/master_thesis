Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a list of tuples (inputs, outputs). What do you want to compare it with?

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica I meant that the network should be able to predict the correct output for each input in the training set.

Answer: You can use `np.testing.assert_allclose` from numpy. It will check if two arrays are equal up to some tolerance. In your case, you would need to define the tolerance yourself. For instance, if you have an array `x`, and another one `y`, you could write:

\begin{code}
import numpy as np

def assert_equal(x, y):
    np.testing.assert_allclose(x, y)
\end{code}
