Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are the same in that they both have a single `0` and a single `7`, but the second one has an extra `0`. Are you saying that it should be rejected?

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica Yes, exactly. It is supposed to reject the second example because there is an extra zero.

Answer: You can use [`itertools.product`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product) to generate all possible combinations of inputs and outputs, then filter out those which don't match your requirements:

\begin{code}
from itertools import product

def test_input(x):
    return len([y for x, y in product(range(8), range(8)) if (x[0] == 0 or x[1] == 7) and (y[0] == 0 or y[1] == 7)]) == 1

print(list(filter(test_input, [
    [(0, 7, 0), (0, 0, 7), (0, 7, 7)],
    [(0, 0, 0), (7, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)],
    [(0, 7, 7), (7, 0, 7), (7, 7, 7)]
]))
\end{code}

Solution:
7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7
0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0
