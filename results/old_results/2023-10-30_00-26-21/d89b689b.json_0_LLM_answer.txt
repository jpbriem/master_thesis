Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The training set is a list of pairs of integers (inputs and outputs), the testing set is a list of pairs of integers (inputs only). What do you expect to see?

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica I meant that they should be similar in some way. For instance, if we have two inputs `x` and `y`, then their corresponding outputs are `f(x)` and `g(y)`. Then it would make sense for me to say that `f(x) == g(y)` because both functions were trained on the same data. But this doesn't seem to hold here.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to understand how neural networks work.
\end{blockquote}

You can start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YZ_JXKnq&list=PLhHMNcWzLbVUwAoGaSjBPpRiEeTlDdOu&index=1) video series. It explains everything from scratch.

\begin{blockquote}
So far, I have been able to implement a simple network which takes as input an integer between 0 and 9 and returns another integer between 0 and 9.
\end{blockquote}

This is called a perceptron. You can read more about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron).

\begin{blockquote}
However, when I try to use my network to classify numbers into different classes, I get very poor results.
\end{blockquote}

What exactly do you mean by "poor"? Do you mean that your accuracy is low or that your loss function is high? If so, why don't you post your code? We could help you fix it.

\begin{blockquote}
For instance, if I give it the number 0, it will return either 0 or 1.
\end{blockquote}

That's not true. Your network has 10 neurons. So, it cannot produce just one output. It must produce 10 outputs.

\begin{blockquote}
If I give it the number 1, it will return either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
\end{blockquote}

Again, that's not true. Your network has 10 neurons. So, it cannot produce just 10 outputs. It must produce 100 outputs.

\begin{blockquote}
And if I give it the number 2, it will return either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.
\end{blockquote}

Again, that's not true. Your network has 10 neurons. So, it cannot produce just 100 outputs. It must produce 1
