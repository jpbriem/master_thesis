Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it produces the expected results. What do you expect?

Comment: @user2357112supportsMonica I think he means that the program should be able to predict the next number in a sequence based on previous numbers. For instance, if we have `0, 0, 0` as an input, then the program should return `0, 0, 0`. If we have `0, 0, 0, 0`, then the program should return `0, 0, 0, 0`. And so on...

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to write a simple neural network for my homework. It works fine but I don't know how to make it better.
\end{blockquote}

The first thing to note about your code is that it doesn't actually implement a neural network. A neural network has multiple layers; yours only has one layer. You need at least two layers (input and hidden) before you can call it a neural network.

You also seem to be using the term "neural network" rather loosely. Your code implements a single-layer perceptron, which is just a very basic form of neural network. There are many other types of neural networks with different architectures.

\begin{blockquote}
My question is: How can I improve this code?
\end{blockquote}

There are several ways to improve your code. One way would be to add another layer. Another way would be to use a more sophisticated activation function than `sigmoid`. Yet another way would be to use backpropagation instead of gradient descent.

But those aren't the only possible improvements. In fact, there are probably hundreds or thousands of possible improvements. Which ones you choose depends on what you want to achieve.
