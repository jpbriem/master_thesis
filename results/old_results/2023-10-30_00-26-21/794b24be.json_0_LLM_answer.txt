Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it produces the expected results. What do you expect to see?

Comment: @user3489756 I think he means that the program should be able to predict the next state from a given state (and the previous states). But this is impossible because there are only two possible states for each cell. So if we know the current state, then we also know the next state.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to implement Conway's Game of Life in Java.
\end{blockquote}

You don't need to implement it yourself. There are already implementations available. For instance [this one](https://github.com/jgrapenthin/game-of-life) or [this one](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077319/core-java/conways-game-of-life--a-simple-example-of-simulation-with-java.html).

\begin{blockquote}

The problem is that when I run my code, it doesn't give me the same result as the original game.
\end{blockquote}

Your code does exactly what the original game does. It just uses different rules than the original game. You can easily change your code so that it behaves like the original game.

\begin{blockquote}

Can someone help me figure out why my code isn't working properly?
\end{blockquote}

It works perfectly fine. Your code is correct.
