Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The first two examples are different from each other and the last three are all the same.

Comment: @user253751 Sorry for that, I meant to say that they are all the same. Edited now.

Answer: You can use a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure to solve this problem in O(n). A trie is basically an array of arrays where each inner array contains the characters of one word. For example, if we have the words `apple`, `orange` and `pear`, then our trie would look like this:

Now, when we get a new word, we just need to check whether it exists in the trie or not. If it does exist, we return true; otherwise, we return false. This takes O(n) time because we only need to traverse the trie once.

If we want to make this faster, we could use a hash table instead of a trie. However, this will take O(n log n) time since we need to do a binary search on the hash table.
