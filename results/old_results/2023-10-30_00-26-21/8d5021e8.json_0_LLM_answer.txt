Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The test set is a different distribution than the training set. If you want to know how well your model generalizes, then it should be tested on data that was never seen during training.

Answer: You can use `model_selection` module from sklearn for this purpose.

\begin{code}
from sklearn import model_selection

X = np.array([[1, 0], [1, 1]])
y = np.array([1, 0])

# split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X, y)

print("Training set")
print(X_train)
print(y_train)

print("\nTesting set")
print(X_test)
print(y_test)
\end{code}
