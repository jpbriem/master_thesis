Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are different from each other and the third is different from both of them.

Comment: @user189857 I meant that they all have the same number of inputs and outputs (i.e., 4).

Answer: You can use a [Huffman tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) to encode your data. This will give you an optimal encoding for your data.

The Huffman algorithm works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a list of all possible characters in your alphabet.
\item For each character, create a node with its frequency as weight.
\item Merge nodes with equal weights into one node.
\item Repeat step 3 until there is only one node left.
\item Assign a binary code to each node.
\end{itemize}

For example, if we have the following frequencies:

\begin{code}
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
\end{code}

Then our initial list would be:

\begin{code}
[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]
\end{code}

We then merge nodes with equal weight:

\begin{code}
[('ab', 3), ('cd', 4)]
\end{code}

And repeat this process until we end up with just one node:

\begin{code}
[('abc', 7)]
\end{code}

Now we assign a binary code to each node:

\begin{code}
['000', '001']
\end{code}

So now we know how to represent any string using these codes. We can also reverse the process to get back the original strings.

In Python, you could do something like this:

\begin{code}
import collections

def huffman(data):
    """Returns a dict mapping characters to their Huffman codes."""
    # Create a list of all possible characters in your alphabet.
    chars = set()
    for line in data:
        chars |= set(line)

    # Create a dictionary mapping characters to their frequencies.
    freqs = {}
    for char in chars:
        freqs[char] = data.count(char)

    # Create a list of all possible nodes.
    nodes = []
    for char in sorted(chars, key=freqs.get, reverse=True):
        nodes.append((char, freqs[char]))

    # Merge nodes with equal weights into one node.
    while len(nodes) > 1:
        min_weight = float('inf')
        merged_node = None
        for node in nodes:
            if node[1] == min_weight:
                merged_node = node
                break
        else:
            raise ValueError("Couldn't find minimum-weight node.")
        for node in nodes[:]:
            if node[1] == min_weight:
                del nodes[nodes.index(node)]
                node[0].extend(merged_node[0])
                node[1] += merged_node[1]

    # Repeat step 3 until there is only one node left.
    while len(nodes) > 1:
        min_weight = float('inf')
        merged_node = None
        for node in nodes:
            if node[1] == min_weight:
                merged_node = node
                break
        else:
            raise ValueError("Couldn't find minimum-weight node.")
        for node in nodes[:]:
            if node[1] == min_weight:
                del nodes[nodes.index(node)]
                node[0].extend(merged_node[0])
                node[1] += merged_node[1]

    # Assign a binary code to each node.
    return {node[0][0]: bin(int(node[0][1])).replace('b', '') for node in nodes}
