Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are different from each other and the last three are all the same.

Comment: @user202729 Sorry for that, I meant to say that they are all the same. Edited now.

Answer: You can use a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) (or an array if you don't need O(1) lookup time).

The hash function is just `f(x) = x % N`, where `N` is the size of your hash table.

To find out whether there already exists an entry with the given key, you do a linear search in the hash table. If it doesn't exist, add it.

If you want to make this more efficient, you could also use a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), which allows you to perform a binary search instead of a linear one.
