Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The first two examples are different from each other and the last one is different from all three others.

Comment: @user1898567 I meant that they should be identical in terms of their outputs.

Answer: You can use a [trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) to store your words. A trie is basically an array of arrays where each inner array contains the letters for a word. For instance, if we have the following words:

\begin{code}
apple
apples
banana
orange
pear
pears
\end{code}

We would create a trie like this:

\begin{code}
[['a', 'p', 'p'], ['l', 'e','s']]
\end{code}

Now, when we get a new word `peach`, we can check whether it exists in our trie by checking whether there is any path through the trie which leads us to the letter `'c'` at the end. If so, then we know that `peach` is contained within our set of words.

In order to do this efficiently, we need to make sure that we don't search the entire trie every time we want to find out whether a given word is present or not. We can do this by using a hash table (which is just another name for a dictionary). In particular, we will use a hash table with keys being the prefixes of the words in our trie and values being pointers to the corresponding nodes in the trie. So, for example, if we had the above trie, we could construct a hash table as follows:

\begin{code}
{'ap': [['a', 'p', 'p']], 'le': [['l', 'e','s']]}
\end{code}

This way, whenever we receive a new word `peach`, we can look up its prefix `pe` in our hash table and follow the pointer to the node containing the letter `'c'` at the end. This will tell us whether `peach` is contained in our set of words.

The code below implements this approach. It uses Python dictionaries instead of C++ maps because I am more familiar with Python than C++, but the basic idea is the same.

\begin{code}
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def read_words(filename):
    """Reads words from file."""
    return [word.strip() for line in open(filename)]

def build_trie(words):
    """Builds a trie from words."""
    # Build a trie.
    trie = []
    for word in words:
        current = trie[-1]
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if len(current) == 0:
                current = [[word[i]]]
            else:
                current.append([word[i]])
        trie.append(current)
    return trie

def lookup(prefix, trie):
    """Looks up a prefix in a trie."""
    current = trie
    while True:
        next_index = None
        for index, child in enumerate(current):
            if prefix[:index] == child:
                next_index = index
                break
        if next_index is None:
            return False
        current = child
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    words = read_words(filename)
    trie = build_trie(words)
    print('Testing...')
    for word in words:
        print('%r: %r' % (word, lookup(word, trie)))
\end{code}
