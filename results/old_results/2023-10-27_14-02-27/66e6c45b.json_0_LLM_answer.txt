In this example, the training data consists of four inputs and their corresponding outputs. The test data also consists of four inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input is a vector of integers, and each output is also a vector of integers.

The goal of the neural network in this example is to learn the relationship between the input vectors and their corresponding output vectors. To do this, the neural network uses the training data to adjust the weights and biases of its connections between the layers. Once the neural network has been trained on the training data, it can be used to make predictions on new input data by passing that data through the network. In this case, the predicted output for the test data is `2, 0, 0, 3`.
