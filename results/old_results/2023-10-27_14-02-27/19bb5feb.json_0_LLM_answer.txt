End of example.
\end{code}

As you can see, the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as matrices with dimensions `(784,)` and `(10,)`, respectively, where each row represents a single input sample. The `train` matrix contains the training data, while the `test` matrix contains the test data.

The `train` and `test` outputs are also represented as matrices with dimensions `(10,)`. The `train` output matrix contains the predicted labels for the training data, while the `test` output matrix contains the actual labels for the test data.

In this example, we have used a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing 8 neurons to classify the input data into two classes. The network has been trained on the training data using the backpropagation algorithm, and its performance is evaluated on the test data using the test output matrix.
