As you can see, the training and test data are quite different in terms of their distribution of values. The training data has a more even distribution of values, while the test data has a more skewed distribution with some values being much larger than others. This is reflected in the output of the model, which produces a higher accuracy on the training data (2/3) compared to the test data (3/5).
