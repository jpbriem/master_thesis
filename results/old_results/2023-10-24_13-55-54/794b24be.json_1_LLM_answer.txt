LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the middle letter is changed to match the middle letter of the previous row, while the first and last letters remain unchanged. Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

a, b, a
a, b, b
b, a, a

The pattern applies to the test input as follows:

* The first row of the test input is "a, b, a". The middle letter "b" matches the middle letter of the previous row ("b"), so the first row of the test output should have the same first and last letters as the original input, but with the middle letter changed to match the previous row's middle letter, resulting in "c, b, a".
* The second row of the test input is "a, b, b". The middle letter "b" matches the middle letter of the previous row ("b"), so the second row of the test output should have the same first and last letters as the original input, but with the middle letter changed to match the previous row's middle letter, resulting in "c, b, b".
* The third row of the test input is "b, a, a". The middle letter "a" does not match the middle letter of the previous row ("b"), so the third row of the test output should have the same first letter as the original input, but with the middle letter changed to match the previous row's middle letter, resulting in "c, a, a".

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

c, b, a
c, b, b
c, a, a
