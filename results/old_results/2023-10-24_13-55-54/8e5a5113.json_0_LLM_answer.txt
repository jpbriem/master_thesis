LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
b, b, c, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
e, b, b, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
e, e, b, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
train output:
b, b, c, f, e, e, b, f, b, e, e
e, b, b, f, e, b, b, f, b, b, e
e, e, b, f, b, b, c, f, c, b, b
End of example.
train input:
g, d, d, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
g, d, d, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
g, d, c, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
train output:
g, d, d, f, g, g, g, f, c, d, g
g, d, d, f, d, d, d, f, d, d, g
g, d, c, f, c, d, d, f, d, d, g
End of example.
train input:
c, h, i, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
h, h, i, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
i, i, i, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
train output:
c, h, i, f, i, h, c, f, i, i, i
h, h, i, f, i, h, h, f, i, h, h
i, i, i, f, i, i, i, f, i, h, c
End of example.
test input:
d, d, j, f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, based on their position in the grid.

The first letter in each row of the input is replaced by the second letter in the corresponding row of the output. The second letter in each row of the input is replaced by the third letter in the corresponding row of the output. The third letter in each row of the input is replaced by the first letter in the corresponding row of the output.

Using this pattern, we can create a table of correspondences between the letters in the input and the letters in the output:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| b | b |
| e | e |
| f | f |
| a | c |
| d | g |
| h | h |
| i | i |
| j | j |
| k | k |

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

| Test Input | Test Output |
| --- | --- |
| d | g |
| d | g |
| j | j |
| f | f |
| a | c |
| a | c |
| a | c |
| f | f |
| a | c |
| a | c |
| a | c |

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

g, g, j, f, c, c, c, f, c, c, c

Solution:
d, d, j, f, c, j, d, f, j, j, c
j, j, j, f, j, j, d, f, j, j, j
c, j, j, f, j, j, j, f, j, d, d
