LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, according to the following rules:

* 'a' becomes 'a' or 'e'
* 'b' becomes 'b' or 'f'
* 'c' becomes 'c' or 'd'

To decrypt the test input, we can apply these rules to each letter in turn:

1. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
2. 'a' becomes 'e' (since it is already 'a')
3. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
4. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
5. 'f' becomes 'f' (since it is already 'f')
6. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
7. 'a' becomes 'e' (since it is already 'a')
8. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
9. 'd' becomes 'd' (since it is already 'd')
10. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
11. 'a' becomes 'e' (since it is already 'a')
12. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
13. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
14. 'a' becomes 'a' (since it is already 'a')
15. 'a' becomes 'e' (since it is already 'a')

Therefore, the test output would be:

a, e, a
a, f, a
a, d, a
a, a, a
a, e, a
a, a, e
a, a, a
a, d, a
a, a, a
a, e, a
a, a, a
a, a, a
a, e, a

Solution:
a, d, a
d, d, a
a, d, d
