LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing certain cells with new values based on their current values and the positions of nearby cells.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Replace every cell with a neighboring cell's value, based on a specific pattern (e.g., replace the center cell with the top-left corner cell's value).
2. Replace every cell with a constant value (e.g., 'd') if it matches a certain condition (e.g., being surrounded by four cells with the same value).
3. Replace every cell with a different constant value (e.g., 'c') if it matches a different condition (e.g., being surrounded by four cells with different values).
4. Replace every cell with yet another constant value (e.g., 'b') if it matches a third condition (e.g., being surrounded by three cells with the same value and one cell with a different value).
5. Replace every cell with a final constant value (e.g., 'a') if it matches a fourth condition (e.g., being surrounded by two cells with the same value and two cells with different values).

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rules for transforming the input grid:

1. If the center cell's value is equal to the top-left corner cell's value, then replace the center cell's value with the top-right corner cell's value.
2. If the center cell's value is equal to the top-right corner cell's value, then replace the center cell's value with the bottom-left corner cell's value.
3. If the center cell's value is equal to the bottom-left corner cell's value, then replace the center cell's value with the bottom-right corner cell's value.
4. If the center cell's value is equal to the bottom-right corner cell's value, then replace the center cell's value with the top-left corner cell's value.
5. If the center cell's value is not equal to any of the surrounding cells' values, then replace it with a constant value (e.g., 'd').
6. If the center cell's value is equal to the surrounding cells' values, but not all of them are the same value, then replace it with another constant value (e.g., 'c').
7. If the center cell's value is equal to three surrounding cells' values and not equal to the fourth surrounding cell's value, then replace it with yet another constant value (e.g., 'b').
8. If the center cell's value is equal to two surrounding cells' values and not equal to the other two surrounding cells' values, then replace it with a final constant value (e.g., 'a').

Now, let's apply these rules to the test input:

f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
a, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f
f, f, a, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, a, f, f, f, f, f, f
a, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
a, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f

After applying the above rules, we get the following transformed grid:

f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
a, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f
f, f, a, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, a, f, f, f, f, f, f
a, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f
a, f, f, f, f,
