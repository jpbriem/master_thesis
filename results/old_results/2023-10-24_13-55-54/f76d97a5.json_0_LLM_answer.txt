LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
e, f, e
f, f, f
e, f, e
train output:
a, e, a
e, e, e
a, e, a
End of example.
train input:
f, f, g, g, g
g, f, f, g, g
g, g, f, f, g
g, g, g, f, f
f, g, g, g, f
train output:
g, g, a, a, a
a, g, g, a, a
a, a, g, g, a
a, a, a, g, g
g, a, a, a, g
End of example.
train input:
j, f, j, j, j
j, j, f, f, j
j, f, j, j, j
j, j, f, j, j
j, j, j, f, f
train output:
a, j, a, a, a
a, a, j, j, a
a, j, a, a, a
a, a, j, a, a
a, a, a, j, j
End of example.
test input:
d, d, d, f, d
d, f, d, d, d
d, f, f, d, f
d, d, d, f, d
f, f, f, d, d

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, according to the following rules:

* 'e' becomes 'a'
* 'f' becomes 'g'
* 'j' becomes 'a'

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can substitute each letter in the input with the corresponding letter in the output, using the above rules:

test input: d, d, d, f, d
-> test output: a, a, a, g, a

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:
a, a, a, g, a

Solution:
a, a, a, d, a
a, d, a, a, a
a, d, d, a, d
a, a, a, d, a
d, d, d, a, a
