LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row, the first letter is repeated as many times as it appears in that row, followed by the second letter repeating in the same way, and so on. Therefore, the test output would be:

c, c, a, c
a, c, a, a
a, a, c, a
c, a, a, a
a, a, c, c

So, the answer is:

c, c, a, c
a, c, a, a
a, a, c, a
c, a, a, a
a, a, c, c
################################################################

Solution:
c, c, a, b
a, c, a, a
a, a, b, a
b, a, a, a
a, a, c, c
