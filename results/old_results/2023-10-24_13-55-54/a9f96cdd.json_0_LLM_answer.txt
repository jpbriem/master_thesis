LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, followed by a new row, and then the process repeats. The output for each row is the same letter (in this case, 'a') except for the last row, which has a different letter ('d', 'g', or 'h').

Therefore, the solution to the test input would be:

test output:
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, c
a, a, a, a, a
d, a, g, a, a

Solution:
a, a, a, d, a
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, i, a
