LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, based on their positions in the grid.

Here's the step-by-step pattern:

1. The first letter in the input (i) is replaced by the second letter in the output (h).
2. The second letter in the input (f) is replaced by the third letter in the output (i).
3. The third letter in the input (i) is replaced by the fourth letter in the output (f).
4. The fourth letter in the input (f) is replaced by the fifth letter in the output (e).
5. The fifth letter in the input (c) is replaced by the sixth letter in the output (d).

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test input: i, i, e, f

Substituting each letter based on its position in the grid, we get:

test output: h, i, g, e

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

h, i, g, e
