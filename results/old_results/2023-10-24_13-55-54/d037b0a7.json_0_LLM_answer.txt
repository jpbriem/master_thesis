LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, a, g
a, e, a
d, a, a
train output:
a, a, g
a, e, g
d, e, g
End of example.
train input:
a, c, a
h, a, i
a, a, a
train output:
a, c, a
h, c, i
h, c, i
End of example.
train input:
e, a, a
a, c, a
a, a, a
train output:
e, a, a
e, c, a
e, c, a
End of example.
test input:
e, a, i
a, a, a
a, h, a

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that each letter in the input corresponds to a specific letter in the output, based on their position in the row. Specifically:

* The first letter in each row of the input corresponds to the first letter in the corresponding row of the output.
* The second letter in each row of the input corresponds to the second letter in the corresponding row of the output.
* The third letter in each row of the input corresponds to the third letter in the corresponding row of the output.

Using this pattern, we can predict the test output as follows:

test input: e, a, i

* The first letter "e" corresponds to the first letter "e" in the first row of the test output.
* The second letter "a" corresponds to the second letter "a" in the second row of the test output.
* The third letter "i" corresponds to the third letter "i" in the third row of the test output.

Therefore, the test output would be: e, a, i

Solution:
e, a, i
e, a, i
e, h, i
