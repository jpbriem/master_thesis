LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves matching certain characters (letters or symbols) in the input string to produce a corresponding output string. Specifically, the pattern seems to involve finding sequences of identical characters (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and replacing them with a different character.

Here's a summary of the patterns observed in the training data:

1. Train Input 1: The input string contains four consecutive identical characters (c, c, c, c), followed by a single character (i) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first three instances of the repeated character (c) with a new character (i), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
2. Train Input 2: The input string contains five consecutive identical characters (e, e, e, e, e), followed by a single character (f) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first four instances of the repeated character (e) with a new character (f), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
3. Train Input 3: The input string contains six consecutive identical characters (d, d, d, d, d, d), followed by a single character (f) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first five instances of the repeated character (d) with a new character (f), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
4. Train Input 4: The input string contains seven consecutive identical characters (c, c, c, c, c, c, c), followed by a single character (i) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first six instances of the repeated character (c) with a new character (i), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
5. Train Input 5: The input string contains eight consecutive identical characters (e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e), followed by a single character (f) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first seven instances of the repeated character (e) with a new character (f), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
6. Train Input 6: The input string contains nine consecutive identical characters (d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d), followed by a single character (f) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first eight instances of the repeated character (d) with a new character (f), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
7. Train Input 7: The input string contains ten consecutive identical characters (c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c), followed by a single character (i) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first nine instances of the repeated character (c) with a new character (i), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
8. Train Input 8: The input string contains eleven consecutive identical characters (e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e), followed by a single character (f) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first ten instances of the repeated character (e) with a new character (f), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.
9. Train Input 9: The input string contains twelve consecutive identical characters (d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d), followed by a single character (f) that is not part of the repeated sequence. The output string replaces the first eleven instances of the repeated character (d) with a new character (f), leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged.

Based on these observations, it seems that the pattern involves replacing the first n-1 instances of a repeated character with a new character, while leaving the last instance of the repeated character unchanged. The value of n varies across the training data, with n = 3 for Train Input 1, n = 4 for Train Input 2, n = 5 for Train Input 3, n = 6 for Train Input 4, n = 7 for Train Input 5, n = 8 for Train Input 6, n = 9 for Train Input 7, n = 10 for Train Input 8, and n = 11 for Train Input 9.

Therefore, to solve the test case, we need to apply this pattern to the given test input string. The test input string contains several groups of repeating characters, so we need to apply the pattern to each group separately. Here'
