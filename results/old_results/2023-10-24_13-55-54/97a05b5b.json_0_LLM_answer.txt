LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used to generate the output is a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can start by converting the input into a numerical representation, where each letter is assigned a number based on its position in the alphabet. For example, we could use A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on.

Then, we can apply the substitution cipher by iterating through each letter in the input and replacing it with the corresponding letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, then the first letter 'a' becomes 'd', the second letter 'a' becomes 'e', and so on.

Finally, we convert the numerical representation back into a letter format to obtain the encrypted output.

Using this approach, the test output for the given test input would be:
