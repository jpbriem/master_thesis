LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple letter substitution cipher. Each letter has been replaced by a corresponding letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

To decrypt the message, we need to reverse the process by moving up the alphabet by the same number of positions. Here's the decryption for each row:

1. `h` becomes `f`, `a` becomes `d`, `b` becomes `c`
2. `f` becomes `i`, `f` becomes `e`, `f` becomes `f`
3. `a` becomes `d`, `a` becomes `c`, `b` becomes `f`
4. `h` becomes `j`, `a` becomes `e`, `b` becomes `f`
5. `f` becomes `i`, `h` becomes `k`, `f` becomes `f`
6. `a` becomes `d`, `b` becomes `c`, `h` becomes `j`
7. `b` becomes `f`, `a` becomes `d`, `h` becomes `k`
8. `a` becomes `c`, `f` becomes `i`, `h` becomes `j`
9. `f` becomes `f`, `a` becomes `d`, `b` becomes `c`
10. `a` becomes `c`, `b` becomes `f`, `h` becomes `j`

Applying this pattern to the test input yields the following test output:

test output:
f, e, d, c, f, k, j, i, d, c

Note that the encryption and decryption processes are both simple letter substitution ciphers. However, they differ in the specific letter substitutions used.
