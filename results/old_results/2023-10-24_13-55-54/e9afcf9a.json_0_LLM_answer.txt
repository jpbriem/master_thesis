LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
d, d, d, d, d, d
j, j, j, j, j, j
train output:
d, j, d, j, d, j
j, d, j, d, j, d
End of example.
train input:
e, e, e, e, e, e
i, i, i, i, i, i
train output:
e, i, e, i, e, i
i, e, i, e, i, e
End of example.
test input:
g, g, g, g, g, g
c, c, c, c, c, c
test output:[/INST]

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple substitution cipher, where each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output. The mapping between the input and output letters is consistent across both training examples.

To decrypt the test input, we can apply the same substitution method. Here's the test output:

g, g, g, g, g, g
c, c, c, c, c, c

Using the pattern from the training data, we can substitute each letter in the test input with the corresponding letter in the test output:

g -> d
g -> j
g -> d
g -> j
g -> d
g -> j

c -> e
c -> i
c -> e
c -> i
c -> e
c -> i

Therefore, the test output would be:

d, j, d, j, d, j
e, i, e, i, e, i

Solution:
g, c, g, c, g, c
c, g, c, g, c, g
