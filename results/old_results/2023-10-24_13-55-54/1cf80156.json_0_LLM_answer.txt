LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern for transforming an input string into an output string involves replacing certain groups of characters with specific values. Here's a summary of the patterns observed in the training data:

1. Replace any occurrence of 'a' followed by 'a' with 'b'.
2. If 'a' is followed by 'b', replace 'a' with 'c'.
3. If 'a' is followed by 'c', replace 'a' with 'b'.
4. If 'a' is followed by 'b' and 'c' is present anywhere in the input string, replace 'a' with 'c'.
5. If 'a' is followed by 'c' and 'b' is present anywhere in the input string, replace 'a' with 'b'.
6. If 'g' is present in the input string, replace it with 'a'.

Applying these patterns to the test input string "a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a", we get the following output:

Output: b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Explanation:

* The first 'a' is replaced with 'b' according to pattern 1.
* The second 'a' is not modified since it's not followed by another 'a'.
* The third 'a' is replaced with 'c' according to pattern 3.
* The fourth 'a' is not modified since it's not followed by 'b'.
* The fifth 'a' is replaced with 'b' according to pattern 5.
* The sixth 'a' is not modified since it's not followed by 'c'.
* The seventh 'a' is replaced with 'a' according to pattern 6, since 'g' is present in the input string.
* The eighth 'a' is not modified since it's not followed by 'b' or 'c'.
