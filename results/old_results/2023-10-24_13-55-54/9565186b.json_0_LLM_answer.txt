LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
c, c, c
c, b, i
c, i, i
train output:
c, c, c
c, f, f
c, f, f
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that each row of letters is transformed into the next row by replacing each letter with the letter that comes after it in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary (so 'z' becomes 'a', 'a' becomes 'b', etc.). Additionally, the middle letter of each row is replaced by the letter that comes before it in the alphabet.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

b, d, c
f, d, c
b, d, c

Here's how the pattern applies to the test input:

1. First row: 'b' becomes 'c' (since 'b' is the first letter of the row), 'd' stays the same, and 'c' becomes 'b' (since 'c' is the last letter of the row).
2. Second row: 'd' becomes 'e' (since 'd' is the second letter of the row), 'd' stays the same, and 'c' becomes 'd' (since 'c' is the last letter of the row).
3. Third row: 'b' becomes 'c' (since 'b' is the first letter of the row), 'd' stays the same, and 'c' becomes 'b' (since 'c' is the last letter of the row).

So, the test output would be:

b, d, c
f, d, c
b, d, c
