LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
j, b, e
j, b, e
c, b, b
train output:
j, b, e
j, b, e
c, b, b
c, b, b
j, b, e
j, b, e
End of example.
train input:
e, i, e

i, h, i
train output:
e, i, e
h, g, h
i, h, i
i, h, i
h, g, h
e, i, e
End of example.
train input:

j, f, f
f, b, h
train output:
h, h, h
j, f, f
f, b, h
f, b, h
j, f, f
h, h, h
End of example.
train input:
c, g, j
c, g, j
c, j, c
train output:
c, g, j
c, g, j
c, j, c
c, j, c

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, followed by a third row that is either the same as one of the previous two rows or a combination of elements from both.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can break it down into three rows:

1. c, j, c
2. i, f, c
3. c, c, i

We can then repeat each row twice, resulting in six rows:

1. c, j, c
1. c, j, c
2. i, f, c
2. i, f, c
3. c, c, i
3. c, c, i

Next, we need to combine elements from the first two rows to create a third row. We can take the first element of the first row (c) and combine it with the second element of the second row (f) to get cf. Similarly, we can take the second element of the first row (j) and combine it with the first element of the second row (i) to get ji. Finally, we can take the third element of the first row (c) and combine it with the third element of the second row (c) to get cc.

Therefore, the test output would be:

1. c, j, c
1. c, j, c
2. i, f, c
2. i, f, c
3. cf, ji, cc

The final answer is:

cf, ji, cc
