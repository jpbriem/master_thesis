LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, a, a, a
a, d, e, a
a, h, g, a
a, a, a, a
train output:
d, a, a, e
a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a
h, a, a, g
End of example.
train input:
a, a, a, a
a, f, g, a
a, i, d, a

train output:
f, a, a, g
a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a
i, a, a, d
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, with some modifications, and then followed by a new row. Specifically:

* The first row of the input is repeated verbatim as the second row.
* The third row is a modified version of the first row, with some letters changed.
* The fourth row is a repeat of the second row.
* The fifth row is a modified version of the third row, with some letters changed.
* The sixth row is a repeat of the fourth row.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

1. Repeat the first row of the test input (a, a, a, a) twice:
a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a
2. Modify the first row to create the third row:
a, c, d, a
3. Repeat the second row of the test input (a, a, a, a):
a, a, a, a
4. Modify the third row to create the fifth row:
e, j, a, a
5. Repeat the fourth row of the test input (a, a, a, a):
a, a, a, a
6. Apply the pattern again to create the final output:
f, a, a, g

Therefore, the test output would be:
f, a, a, g
a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a
e, j, a, a

Solution:
c, a, a, d
a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a
e, a, a, j
