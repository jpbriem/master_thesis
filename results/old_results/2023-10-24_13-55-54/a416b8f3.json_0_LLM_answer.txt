LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, f, a
f, f, c
a, a, a
train output:
a, f, a, a, f, a
f, f, c, f, f, c
a, a, a, a, a, a
End of example.
train input:
d, a, a
c, d, a
c, b, i
a, b, a
train output:
d, a, a, d, a, a
c, d, a, c, d, a
c, b, i, c, b, i
a, b, a, a, b, a
End of example.
train input:
f, c, d, a

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each letter in the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input can be obtained by applying the same copying mechanism:

test input: e, a, a, a
e, f, a, a
a, f, g, a
g, g, b, a
a, a, a, b

test output: e, a, a, a, e, f, a, a
e, f, a, a, e, f, a, a
a, f, g, a, a, f, g, a
g, g, b, a, g, g, b, a
a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b

Note that this solution assumes that the letters in the input and output are treated as distinct symbols, and not as part of a word or phrase. If the letters are part of a word or phrase, then the solution would need to take into account the order of the letters and the fact that some letters may appear more than once in the input.

Solution:
e, a, a, a, e, a, a, a
e, f, a, a, e, f, a, a
a, f, g, a, a, f, g, a
g, g, b, a, g, g, b, a
a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b
