LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the first letter is copied to the corresponding position in the output, followed by the second letter being copied to the third position in the output, and then the third letter being copied to the fifth position in the output. This is repeated for each row, with the last letter of each row being ignored.

Therefore, the test output would be:

a, g, g, e, a, a, i
a, g, a, e, i, i, i
g, a, g, e, a, a, a

The first letter of each row (a, g, and g) is copied to the corresponding position in the output (c, a, and c). The second letter of each row (g, a, and a) is copied to the third position in the output (a, c, and a). The third letter of each row (e, e, and e) is copied to the fifth position in the output (i, i, and i). The remaining letters are ignored.

Solution:
a, c, c
c, c, c
c, a, c
