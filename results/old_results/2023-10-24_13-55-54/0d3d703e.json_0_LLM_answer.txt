LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be a simple letter substitution cipher. Each letter in the input row is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output row, based on their positions.

Here's the decoded output for each training input:

1st training input:
Input: d, b, c
Output: e, f, g

2nd training input:
Input: c, d, i
Output: g, e, j

3rd training input:
Input: f, i, g
Output: b, j, c

4th training input:
Input: j, e, c
Output: i, d, g

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: i, b, d

Using the same substitution method, we can decode the test input as follows:

Test output: j, e, g

Therefore, the answer for the test input is "j, e, g".

Solution:
j, f, e
j, f, e
j, f, e
