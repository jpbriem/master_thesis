LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each letter in the input is replaced by a corresponding letter in the output, according to the following rules:

* 'a' becomes 'c'
* 'c' becomes 'j'
* 'j' becomes 'a'

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can substitute each letter in the input with the corresponding letter in the output, using the above rules. Here's the resulting test output:

test output:
c, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
c, c, c, a, a, a, c, c, c, c
a, a, a, a, a, a, c, c, c, c
a, c, c, c, a, a, c, c, c, c
a, c, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, c, c, c, a, c, c, c, c, a
a, c, c, c, a, c, c, c, c, a
a, c, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Note that the last two lines of the test input are not modified, since they already consist of only 'a's and 'c's, which are the same letters that appear in the corresponding positions in the test output.
