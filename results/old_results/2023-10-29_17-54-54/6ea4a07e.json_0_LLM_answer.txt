As you can see from the examples above, the neural network is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs, and make correct predictions on new data.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example, and in real-world applications, the data would likely be much more complex and the models would need to be trained on larger datasets for longer periods of time. Additionally, the model would need to be evaluated on a test set to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.
