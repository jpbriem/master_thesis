This is just a simple example to illustrate the concept of neural networks and how they can be used for classification tasks. In this case, we have trained a network on three inputs (2, 2, 1), (1, 5, 1) and (5, 2, 2) and it has learned to predict the correct output for each input.

The first training example shows that the network has learned to recognize the pattern of two followed by one, and outputs 2 and 1 as the predicted values. The second training example shows that the network has learned to recognize the pattern of five followed by two, and outputs 5 and 2 as the predicted values. The third training example shows that the network has learned to recognize the pattern of five followed by eight, and outputs 5 and 8 as the predicted values.

In the test example, we provide the network with three new inputs (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 4) and (9, 3, 4) and it correctly predicts the output for each input, recognizing the pattern of nine followed by three or four.

This is just a basic example, but it illustrates the potential of neural networks for solving complex problems in a wide range of fields, from image recognition to natural language processing. With more data and more sophisticated architectures, neural networks can learn to recognize even more complex patterns and make accurate predictions in a wide range of applications.
