Is the neural network correctly trained?
Yes, the neural network is correctly trained. It has learned to predict the next number in a sequence based on the previous numbers. In all three examples, the predicted outputs match the actual outputs.

What about the generalization ability of the model?
The generalization ability of the model refers to its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Based on the training examples provided, the model appears to have good generalization ability. However, it would be important to test the model on more diverse and complex examples to ensure that it can generalize well to new situations.
