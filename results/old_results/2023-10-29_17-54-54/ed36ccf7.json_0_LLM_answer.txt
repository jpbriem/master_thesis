In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and two outputs. The training data consists of four examples, each with three input values and two output values. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights and biases in order to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

The first example shows the network being trained on a simple linear function, where the input values are all equal to 9, and the output values are all equal to 9. The network learns to predict the correct output values for this case.

The second example shows the network being trained on a more complex non-linear function, where the input values are all equal to 6, but the output values are different. The network learns to predict the correct output values for this case as well.

The third example shows the network being tested on a new set of input values, which are all equal to 0. The network correctly predicts the output values for these cases as well.

Overall, this example demonstrates how a neural network can be trained to learn from data and make predictions based on that learning.
