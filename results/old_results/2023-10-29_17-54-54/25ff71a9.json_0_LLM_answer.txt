In this example, the model is trained on three inputs and corresponding outputs. The first two inputs are both valid, and the third input is invalid (i.e., it does not satisfy the constraint). During training, the model learns to predict the correct output for each input based on the constraint.

After training, we can test the model with a new input that violates the constraint. In this case, the input is `2, 0, 0`, which is not a valid solution because it does not satisfy the constraint. As expected, the model correctly predicts `0, 0, 0` as the output, indicating that the input is not a valid solution.

We can also test the model with other inputs to see how well it generalizes to new situations. For example, if we provide the input `0, 1, 0`, the model should predict `0, 1, 0` as the output, since this input satisfies the constraint. Similarly, if we provide the input `0, 2, 2`, the model should predict `0, 2, 2` as the output, since this input also satisfies the constraint.

Overall, this simple neural network has learned to recognize when an input satisfies the constraint and when it does not, based on the training data. By using this model to classify inputs, we can determine whether or not they are valid solutions to the problem.
