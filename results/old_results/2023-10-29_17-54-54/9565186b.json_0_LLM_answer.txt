This is just a simple example to illustrate the concept of how the neural network can learn to predict the next value in a sequence based on the previous values. In this case, the neural network has learned to predict the next number in a sequence of numbers based on the previous two numbers.

In a real-world application, you would need to gather and preprocess the data, choose an appropriate architecture for your neural network, and train it using a suitable optimization algorithm. Additionally, you may need to use techniques such as regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.
