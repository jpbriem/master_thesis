This is a simple neural network that can be used for basic classification tasks. It consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer has three neurons, each representing one of the input features. The hidden layer has two neurons, each receiving the weighted sum of the inputs from the previous layer and applying a nonlinear activation function to produce the output for the next layer. The output layer has three neurons, each representing one of the possible classes.

The weights and biases for the connections between layers are learned during training using backpropagation. The goal of training is to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the true labels, which is measured using a loss function such as cross-entropy loss.

In this example, the training data consists of three examples, each with three input features (x1, x2, x3) and one output feature (y). The first example has input features (3, 3, 8) and output feature (0, 0, 5), the second example has input features (5, 7, 0) and output feature (0, 7, 3), and the third example has input features (5, 5, 2) and output feature (2, 5, 5).

To use this neural network for classification, you would provide it with input features for a new example, and it would predict the class label based on the learned patterns in the training data. For example, if the input features for a new example were (6, 3, 5), the network might predict the class label (0, 0, 5) based on the similarity between the input features and the patterns learned during training.
