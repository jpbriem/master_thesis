The neural network has one hidden layer with 32 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function. The training process is done using the Adam optimizer and a batch size of 64.

I'm having trouble understanding how the neural network is able to solve this problem. I understand that the network takes in three inputs and outputs a single value, but I don't see how it's able to determine the correct output for the given inputs.

Can someone explain how the neural network is able to solve this problem?

Answer: Sure! Let me try to break down how the neural network is able to solve this problem.

First, let's consider the structure of the neural network. It has one hidden layer with 32 neurons, and uses the ReLU activation function. The ReLU activation function is computationally simple, it just returns the input if it's positive, and 0 if it's negative. This means that the neurons in the hidden layer are essentially just passing through the input values, but with a twist.

Now, let's think about the training process. The network is trained using the Adam optimizer and a batch size of 64. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for training deep neural networks because it adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the magnitude of the gradient. In other words, it adjusts the step size of each parameter update based on how well the current estimate is working. The batch size of 64 means that the network is processing 64 examples at a time during training.

During training, the network is presented with many examples like the ones you provided, and it tries to predict the correct output for each example. The loss function used is likely cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output. The network is then updated based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network.

Now, let's consider how the network is able to solve the problem. The key here is that the network is not trying to learn the exact output for each input, but rather the pattern in the data. The network learns to recognize the relationship between the input and output by looking at many examples.

In this case, the network is trying to learn a mapping from a 3-dimensional input space to a 1-dimensional output space. The input space is defined by the three integers, and the output space is defined by a single integer. The network learns to map the input space to the output space by finding a decision boundary that separates the different classes.

The decision boundary is learned by the network by adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons in the hidden layer. The weights and biases are adjusted such that the network can distinguish between the different classes. For example, the network might learn that when the first input is large, the second input is small, and the third input is large, then the output should be large.

Once the network has learned the decision boundary, it can use it to make predictions on new examples that it hasn't seen before. This is why the network is able to generalize to new examples and produce the correct output even though it has never seen those specific inputs before.

In summary, the neural network is able to solve this problem by learning a mapping from the input space to the output space by recognizing patterns in the data. It does this by adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons in the hidden layer to find a decision boundary that separates the different classes. Once the network has learned the decision boundary, it can use it to make predictions on new examples and produce the correct output.
