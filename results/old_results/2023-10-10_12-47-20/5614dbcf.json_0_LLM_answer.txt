This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a neural network with shared weights for multiple outputs. The code first imports the necessary libraries and loads the data. It then defines a function `build_model` that creates the neural network model using the functional API. This function takes the input shape and number of outputs as arguments and returns a compiled model.

The code then calls this function twice, once for each output, and assigns the result to two separate variables `m1` and `m2`. It then compiles the models and trains them on the training data using the `fit` method. Finally, it tests the trained models on the test data using the `evaluate` method and prints the results.

Note that in this example, the inputs are assumed to be numpy arrays with shapes `(batch_size, num_features)`, where `num_features` is the number of features in the input data. The outputs are also numpy arrays with shapes `(batch_size, num_outputs)`, where `num_outputs` is the number of outputs from the model.
