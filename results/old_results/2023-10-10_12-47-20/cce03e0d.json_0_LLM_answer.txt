As you can see, the training data consists of three examples, each with three input values and a corresponding output value. The first input value is always zero, the second input value is either one or two, and the third input value is either zero, one, or two. The output value is always a combination of the input values, specifically:

* If the first input value is zero, the output value is zero.
* If the second input value is one, the output value is the sum of the second and third input values.
* If the third input value is one, the output value is the product of the second and third input values.

The test data consists of three examples, each with three input values. The first input value is always one, the second input value is either two or zero, and the third input value is either two or one.

To solve this problem, you need to find a function that takes three input values and returns the correct output value based on the rules above. You can use any programming language or notation you prefer, but your solution should be written in a way that is easy to understand and explain.

Once you have found a solution, you can test it using the test data to make sure it works correctly. If your solution passes all the test cases, then you have successfully solved the problem!
