This is a classic problem known as the "traffic light problem" or "brain teaser". It's not a real neural network problem, but rather a puzzle that requires a bit of logical thinking.

The task is to determine the order of the traffic lights based on the inputs and outputs provided. The inputs are the states of the traffic lights (red, yellow, green), and the outputs are the resulting states of the traffic lights after some time has passed.

To solve this problem, you need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs and figure out the rules that govern how the traffic lights change state. In this case, there are three traffic lights, so the solution involves determining the order of the three lights and the corresponding rules for their behavior.
