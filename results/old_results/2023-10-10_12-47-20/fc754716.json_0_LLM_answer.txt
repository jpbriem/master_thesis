This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the Repeat-Until-Halt (RUH) problem. The RUH problem is a classic problem in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science. It consists of a tape that can read and write symbols from a finite alphabet, and it has the ability to move the tape left or right and to change the symbol on the tape. The goal is to find a program that will repeat the input string until the tape is empty.

In this notebook, there are five examples of the RUH problem. Each example consists of a train input and a train output, followed by a test input and a corresponding test output. The train input and output are used to train a neural network to solve the problem, while the test input and output are used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

The first example has a simple solution, where the program simply repeats the input string three times. The second example is similar, but with a different number of repetitions. The third example has a more complex solution, where the program reads the input string and then repeats it three times. The fourth example is similar to the third one, but with a different number of repetitions. The fifth example is the most complex one, where the program reads the input string, repeats it six times, and then outputs the last six symbols of the repeated string.

To solve these problems, you need to train a neural network using the train input and output, and then use the test input to evaluate the performance of the trained model. You can modify the code to adjust the architecture of the neural network, the training parameters, and other hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.
