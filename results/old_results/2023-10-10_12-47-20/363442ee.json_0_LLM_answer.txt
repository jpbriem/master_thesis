This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `numpy` library to perform basic operations on arrays and matrices. The notebook provides examples of how to create arrays and matrices, perform element-wise arithmetic operations, and use matrix multiplication. Additionally, it shows how to use the `np.where()` function to find the indices of specific elements in an array.

The notebook first imports the necessary libraries, including `numpy`, and then creates some sample arrays and matrices. It then demonstrates how to perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these arrays and matrices.

Next, the notebook uses the `np.where()` function to find the indices of specific elements in one of the arrays. This function takes an array as input and returns a tuple containing the indices of the elements that match a certain condition. In this case, the notebook uses the `np.where()` function to find the indices of all elements greater than 5 in the array.

Finally, the notebook demonstrates how to use matrix multiplication to multiply two matrices together. Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is used in many machine learning algorithms. The notebook shows how to use the `@` operator to perform matrix multiplication and how to obtain the result as a new matrix.
