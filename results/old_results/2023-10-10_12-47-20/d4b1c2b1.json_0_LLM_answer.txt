This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `keras` library to create a simple neural network that can recognize patterns in input data and generate corresponding output data. The notebook includes several examples of input and output data that the network should be able to recognize, as well as code for defining and training the network using the `keras` API.

The first cell in the notebook imports the necessary libraries, including `numpy`, `pandas`, and `keras`. The second cell defines a function called `build_model` that takes in a list of input data and returns a `Sequential` model object that can be used to generate output data based on the input.

The rest of the cells in the notebook provide examples of input and output data that the network should be able to recognize. Each example consists of a list of input values and a corresponding list of output values. The input values are separated by commas, and the output values are separated by commas and listed below the input values.

For example, the first example has input values `1, 1, 1` and output values `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`. This means that when the network receives the input values `1, 1, 1`, it should produce the output values `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`.

The last cell in the notebook says "End of test." and does not contain any code. It's likely that this cell was added to indicate the end of the test data and separate it from any additional data or code that might follow.
