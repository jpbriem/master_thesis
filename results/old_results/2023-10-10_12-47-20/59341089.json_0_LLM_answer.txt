This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `keras` library to create a neural network that can solve the described problem. The first few lines import the necessary libraries and load the data. The `data` variable contains the training data, which consists of input vectors and corresponding output vectors. The `model` variable defines the architecture of the neural network, which has three layers with 16 neurons each. The `compile` method specifies the loss function and optimizer used during training. The `fit` method trains the model on the training data for 10 epochs. Finally, the `evaluate` method evaluates the performance of the model on the test data.

The code then provides examples of how to use the trained model to make predictions on new input data.
