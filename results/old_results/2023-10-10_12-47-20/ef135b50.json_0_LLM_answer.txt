I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example per batch, and the model is not able to learn useful patterns from such limited data.

To address this, you can try increasing the number of examples per batch by using a larger batch size. For example, instead of using a batch size of 16, you could try using a batch size of 32 or 64. This will allow the model to see more examples during training and potentially learn more robust features.

Additionally, you may want to consider using techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning to increase the amount of available training data. Data augmentation involves generating additional training examples by applying random transformations (such as rotation, scaling, and flipping) to the existing data, while transfer learning involves pre-training the model on a related task before fine-tuning it on your specific task. Both of these techniques can help to increase the amount of available training data and improve the performance of the model.

Finally, it's worth noting that the performance of the model may also depend on the specific architecture and hyperparameters used. You may want to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the best combination for your specific task.
