I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data is not properly normalized. The values in the input vectors are quite large, which can cause problems for the neural network during training.

To address this, you should normalize the input data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This will ensure that the inputs are on the same scale and the network can learn more effectively.

You can use libraries like `numpy` or `sklearn` to perform normalization on your input data before passing it to the neural network. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to normalize the input data:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Load the training data
X_train =... # load the training data
y_train =... # load the training labels

# Normalize the input data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Train the neural network on the normalized data
model.fit(X_train_normalized, y_train)
```
In this code, we first load the training data and then create a `MinMaxScaler` object from `sklearn.preprocessing`. We then apply the scaling transformation to the input data using the `fit_transform()` method, which returns a new array with the normalized values. Finally, we pass the normalized data to the neural network model for training.

By normalizing the input data, you can improve the performance of the neural network and avoid issues related to large input values.
