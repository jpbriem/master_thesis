This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the MNIST dataset in a binary format. The first line of each example specifies the number of inputs and outputs for the following data. For instance, `train input:` followed by three numbers means that the next three lines contain input data for training, and `train output` followed by three numbers means that the next three lines contain corresponding output data.

The input data consists of rows of integers separated by spaces, while the output data consists of rows of integers separated by spaces. Each row represents a single image, with black pixels represented by 0s and white pixels represented by 2s.
