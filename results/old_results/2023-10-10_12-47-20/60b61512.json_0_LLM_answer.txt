This is a simple neural network that takes an 8-dimensional input vector and outputs a single number. The training data consists of pairs of input vectors and corresponding output numbers. The goal is to learn a mapping from input vectors to output numbers that generalizes well to new inputs.

To solve this problem, you can use a variety of techniques, such as gradient descent or genetic algorithms, to find the weights and biases of the neurons in the network that result in good performance on the training data. Once you have trained the network, you can test it on new inputs to see how well it performs.

Note that this is just one example of a simple neural network, and there are many ways to design and train neural networks depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve.
