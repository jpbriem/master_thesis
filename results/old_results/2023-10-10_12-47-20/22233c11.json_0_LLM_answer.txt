I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example with a non-zero output (the last line of the training data). This means that the model is not getting enough information to learn from, and therefore it is not able to generalize well to new examples.

To address this, you can try increasing the amount of training data you have, ideally by adding more examples with different inputs and outputs. You can also try modifying the existing training data to make it more diverse, for example by adding noise or variations to the input values.

Another approach is to use techniques such as data augmentation, which can generate additional training data from the existing data by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can effectively increase the size of your training data without requiring manual creation of new examples.

Finally, you may want to consider using a different architecture for your neural network, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN), depending on the nature of your data and the task at hand. These architectures are better suited for certain types of problems and may be able to learn more robust features from your data.
