This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a simple neural network with two inputs, three hidden units, and one output. The network is trained on a synthetic dataset that consists of six examples, each with eight input values and one output value. The network learns to map the input values to the output value based on the pattern in the training data. When given a new set of input values, the network can predict the corresponding output value.

The code first imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy and Keras. It then defines the synthetic dataset as a list of input-output pairs, where each input is a vector of length eight and each output is a single scalar value.

Next, the code creates the Keras model using the `Sequential` model class from the Keras functional API. The model has two layers: the first layer takes the input vector and applies a linear transformation to produce a vector of length three; the second layer takes the vector of length three and applies a sigmoid activation function to produce the output scalar. The `model.compile` method specifies the loss function and optimizer for training.

The code then trains the model on the synthetic dataset using the `model.fit` method. Finally, it tests the model on a new set of input values to demonstrate its ability to make predictions.

Note that this is just a simple example to illustrate the basic steps involved in creating and training a neural network using the Keras functional API. In practice, you may need to adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of hidden units, etc., to achieve better performance on your specific problem.
