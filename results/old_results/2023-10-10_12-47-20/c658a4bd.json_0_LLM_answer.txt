LLM answer:

3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3
3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3
3, 8, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 8, 3
3, 8, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 8, 3
3, 8, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 8, 3
3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3
3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
\end{code}

The first line contains the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the network (in this case, 25). The second line contains the number of training examples (in this case, 17). The third line contains the number of test examples (in this case, 10).

The next 17 lines contain the input and output for each training example, separated by a space. Each input is a vector of 10 values, represented as a list of 10 numbers separated by spaces. Each output is a single number.

The last 10 lines contain the input and output for each test example, again separated by a space.

To solve this problem, you will need to create a neural network with an input layer that takes in 10 values, a hidden layer with 25 neurons, and an output layer with a single neuron. You will then need to train the network using the training data, and use it to make predictions on the test data.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
