I'm trying to understand how this neural network is supposed to work but I don't get it. Can someone explain me the concept behind this?

Answer: This is a simple neural network that takes in four inputs and outputs a single value. The network consists of two layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.

The input layer has four neurons, each corresponding to one of the input values. The hidden layer has three neurons, and the output layer has a single neuron.

The way the network works is as follows:

1. The input layer receives the four input values and passes them on to the hidden layer.
2. The hidden layer performs a computation on the input values using a set of weights and biases. The computation involves multiplying each input value by its corresponding weight, adding up all the products, and then applying a non-linear activation function to the result. This process is repeated for each neuron in the hidden layer.
3. The output of the hidden layer is passed on to the output layer.
4. The output layer performs a similar computation, using the output of the hidden layer as input, and produces the final output value.

The goal of the network is to learn a mapping between the input values and the output value, so that when given new input values, it can produce the correct output value. To do this, the network uses a supervised learning algorithm called backpropagation, which adjusts the weights and biases of the neurons based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

In the example you provided, the network is trained on a dataset of input-output pairs, where each pair consists of four input values and a corresponding output value. The network learns to predict the output value based on the input values, and the accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using a loss function such as mean squared error or cross-entropy.

Overall, the concept behind this neural network is to use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to learn a non-linear mapping between input values and a output value. The network learns by minimizing the difference between the predicted output and the actual output, and once trained, it can be used to make predictions on new input values.
