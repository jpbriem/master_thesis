This is a simple neural network that takes in 3 inputs and outputs 3 values. The training data consists of 5 examples, each with 3 inputs and 3 corresponding outputs. The test data consists of 3 examples, each with 3 inputs and expected outputs.

The task is to train the neural network using the training data and then use it to predict the outputs for the test data.

To solve this problem, you can use any programming language or framework that supports neural networks. Some popular choices include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn.

Here's an example solution using Keras:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Create the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(3, input_dim=3, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(3, activation='relu'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Predict on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
In this example, we create a sequential model with two dense layers, each with 3 neurons. The first layer has an input dimension of 3, which matches the number of inputs in the training data. The second layer has an output dimension of 3, which matches the number of outputs in the training data. We use the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function to train the model.

After training the model, we use it to predict the outputs for the test data. The `predict()` method returns a tensor with shape `(3, 3)`, which contains the predicted outputs for the three test examples.

Note that this is just one possible way to solve this problem, and there are many other architectures and techniques that could be used depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.
