I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to overfitting. Your model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data (test set). To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. L1 and L2 regularization are common choices. This will help prevent extreme values for the weights and improve generalization.
2. Dropout: Introduce dropout layers in your model to randomly remove neurons during training. This forces the model to learn multiple representations and prevents any single neuron from dominating the behavior.
3. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the process when the loss stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Batch Normalization: Use batch normalization layers in your model. These layers normalize the inputs to each neuron, which can help reduce overfitting by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the generalization of the model.
5. Reduce Model Complexity: Try reducing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer. A simpler model may generalize better than a complex one.
6. Data Augmentation: Increase the size of your training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to the images. This can help provide more information for the model to learn from and improve its ability to generalize.
7. Ensemble Methods: Train multiple models with different architectures, hyperparameters, or initializations. Combine their predictions using methods like bagging or boosting to improve overall performance.
8. Evaluate Different Hyperparameters: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates, number of epochs, and activation functions. You may find that a different combination of hyperparameters leads to better performance.
9. Use a Different Optimizer: Try using an optimizer other than Adam, such as SGD, RMSProp, or Adagrad. Each optimizer has its strengths and weaknesses, and you may find that a different optimizer suits your specific problem better.
10. Analyze Your Data: Check if there are any imbalances in your dataset, such as a disproportionate number of samples from a particular class. If so, consider oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using class weights to balance the classes.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to avoid overfitting. It's essential to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their impact on your specific problem.
