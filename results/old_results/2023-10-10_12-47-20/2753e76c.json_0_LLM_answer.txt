This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of MNIST data, which is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The notebook includes both training and test data, with the goal of using machine learning algorithms to recognize the digits in the images.

The first section of the notebook provides some information about the MNIST dataset, including its size (60,000 training images and 10,000 test images) and the fact that it consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

The next section shows an example of how the data can be loaded into memory using the `numpy` library in Python. This code reads a file containing the MNIST data and stores it in two arrays: `X_train` and `y_train`. `X_train` contains the raw pixel values of the training images, while `y_train` contains the corresponding labels (i.e., the digit that was written in each image).

The following section demonstrates how to preprocess the data by resizing the images to a fixed size (28x28 pixels) and normalizing the pixel values to have zero mean and unit variance. This is done using the `img_size` function, which takes an image array as input and returns a tuple containing the resized image and a mask indicating which pixels correspond to the digit's outline.

The next section shows an example of how to use the preprocessed data to train a simple neural network using the `keras` library in Python. Specifically, this code defines a sequential model consisting of three layers: a convolutional layer with 32 filters, a max pooling layer with a pool size of 2, and a fully connected layer with 10 neurons (corresponding to the 10 possible digit classes). The model is then compiled with a loss function and an optimizer, and trained on the preprocessed training data using the `fit` method.

Finally, the last section tests the trained model on a sample of handwritten digits, using the `evaluate` method to compute the accuracy of the model on the test set.
