I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but that didn't seem to work. Any help would be appreciated!

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. With only 8 examples in the training set, the model has 27 parameters (2 inputs, 3 hidden units, and 1 output), which makes it difficult for the model to generalize well to new data.

To address this issue, you can try reducing the number of parameters in the model by reducing the number of hidden units or using a simpler activation function. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use a linear activation function instead of ReLU. Linear activation functions have fewer parameters than ReLU, and they can still capture non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs.
2. Reduce the number of hidden units from 3 to 2. This will reduce the number of parameters in the model and make it easier to train.
3. Try using a smaller neural network architecture, such as a single perceptron layer with 2 inputs and 1 output. This will significantly reduce the number of parameters in the model and make it easier to train.
4. Increase the amount of training data. If possible, collect more data to increase the size of the training set. This will give the model more information to learn from and improve its ability to generalize to new data.
5. Regularization techniques such as dropout and L1/L2 regularization can also be applied to prevent overfitting.

It's worth noting that even with these changes, the model may still struggle to converge due to the small amount of training data. In that case, you may need to consider other machine learning models such as decision trees or support vector machines, which can handle a small number of training examples better than neural networks.
