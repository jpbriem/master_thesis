\end{code}
This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the game of life. The first cell should be run to generate the initial grid, and then you can step through the cells one at a time to see how the grid evolves over time. You can use the `Next` button in the top right corner of the notebook to advance to the next cell.

The initial grid is generated using the following code:
```
import numpy as np

def generate_grid(size):
    grid = np.zeros((size, size))
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == size - 1 or j == size - 1:
                grid[i, j] = 1
    return grid

size = 64
grid = generate_grid(size)
```
This code creates a grid of size `size` by `size`, initialized with zeros. It then sets the edges of the grid (the rows and columns that are not on the border) to 1. This creates a "toroidal" grid, where the left and right edges are connected, and the top and bottom edges are connected.

The rest of the code consists of several examples of the game of life running on this grid. Each example is contained within a single code cell, and they are labeled with comments indicating which generation number they correspond to.

To run the game of life on the grid, we use the following rules:

* If a cell is alive (has a value of 1), it stays alive in the next generation if it has two or three living neighbors.
* If a cell is dead (has a value of 0), it becomes alive in the next generation if it has exactly three living neighbors.

We iterate over each cell in the grid, applying these rules to determine its new value. We repeat this process many times to simulate the evolution of the grid over time.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions about the code or the game of life.
