This is a classic problem of finding the maximum number of consecutive ones in an array. The solution is to use dynamic programming and create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of consecutive ones ending at index j in the subarray starting from i.

The base case is when the subarray has only one element, then the maximum number of consecutive ones is equal to 1.

For each row of the input, we can calculate the maximum number of consecutive ones by considering two cases:

1. The current element is 1, and we need to find the maximum number of consecutive ones that end at the current index. This can be done by looking at the previous rows and checking if there are any 1s before the current index that are not part of a longer streak of 1s.
2. The current element is 0, and we need to find the maximum number of consecutive ones that start at the current index. This can be done by looking at the previous rows and checking if there are any 1s after the current index that are not part of a longer streak of 1s.

In both cases, we can use the previously calculated values of dp[i-1][j-1] and dp[i-1][j] to get the maximum number of consecutive ones.

The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n^2)

Here's a sample Python code to solve this problem:
```
def maxConsecutiveOnes(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-i):
            if arr[i+j] == 1:
                # Current element is 1, find max consecutive ones ending at j
                max_ones = max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
            else:
                # Current element is 0, find max consecutive ones starting at j
                max_ones = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1])
            dp[i][j] = max_ones + 1

    return dp[n-1][n-1]
```
It's worth mentioning that this problem can also be solved using a single loop and a segment tree, but the idea is similar, you have to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive ones that ends/starts at each index.
