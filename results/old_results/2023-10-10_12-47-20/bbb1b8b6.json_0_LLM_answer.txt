The first line contains the number of training examples, which is 9 in this case. The following lines contain the input and output for each training example, separated by a space. Each input is a vector of 8 binary features, represented as 0s and 1s. The output is a vector of 4 labels, also represented as 0s and 1s.

The last line contains the number of test examples, which is 4 in this case. The following lines contain the input and output for each test example, separated by a space. The input is a vector of 8 binary features, represented as 0s and 1s. The output is a vector of 4 labels, represented as?s, since we don't know the correct output for these examples.

Your task is to use the given training data to learn a classifier that can predict the correct output for the test data. You can use any algorithm or model you like, as long as it's based on the given training data. Good luck!
