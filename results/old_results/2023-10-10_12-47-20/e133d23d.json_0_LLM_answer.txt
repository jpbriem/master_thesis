This is an IPython notebook that contains a single test case for the game of life. The test case consists of five inputs and corresponding expected outputs.

The first line of the input is a list of integers that represent the initial state of the grid. In this case, we have six alive cells (represented by the number 1) and four dead cells (represented by the number 0). The second line is a list of integers that represents the next generation of the grid, based on the rules of the game of life. The third line is another list of integers that represents the next generation after that, and so on. Finally, the last line is a list of integers that represents the final state of the grid, which is the output of the game of life simulation.

The expected outputs for each input are listed below the input, separated by a horizontal line. In this case, the expected outputs are also lists of integers that represent the final state of the grid after running the game of life simulation for five generations.

Note that this is just one possible test case for the game of life, and there are many other possible test cases that could be used to verify the correctness of the game of life algorithm.
