This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a simple neural network with two inputs, three outputs, and a shared hidden layer. The network is trained on a dataset of six examples, and it is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs. When given a new input, the network is able to make predictions about the output.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy and Keras. Then, it defines the input and output data for the training set and the test set. The training set consists of six examples, each with six inputs and six outputs. The test set consists of eight examples, each with six inputs and six outputs.

Next, the code creates the model using the Keras functional API. It defines the input layer, which takes in six neurons (one for each input feature). Then, it defines the hidden layer, which has three neurons (the number of outputs - 1). Finally, it defines the output layer, which also has three neurons. The activation function for the hidden layer is'relu', which stands for rectified linear unit. This is a common activation function used in deep learning.

After creating the model, the code compiles it with a loss function and an optimizer. The loss function measures how well the model's predictions match the true labels. The optimizer is used to update the weights of the model during training so that it can minimize the loss. In this case, the loss function is 'categorical cross-entropy' and the optimizer is 'adam'.

Then, the code trains the model on the training set using the 'fit' method. It specifies the number of epochs (iterations over the training data) and the batch size (number of samples per gradient update). In this case, it trains the model for 10 epochs with a batch size of 64.

Finally, the code tests the model on the test set using the 'evaluate' method. It computes the loss and accuracy of the model on the test set. The accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified examples. In this case, the model achieves an accuracy of 100% on the test set.
