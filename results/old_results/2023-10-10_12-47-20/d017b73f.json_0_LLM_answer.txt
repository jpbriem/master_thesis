I'm trying to use the `keras.Sequential` model and compile it with a loss function and an optimizer, but I keep getting errors. Here is my code so far:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Load data
X = np.loadtxt('data.csv', dtype=np.int8)
y = np.loadtxt('labels.csv', dtype=np.int8)

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# One-hot encode labels
y_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test)

# Define model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```
The error message I get is:

`ValueError: Shape (10,) not supported by broadcasting`

I have tried changing the input shape in the first dense layer to `(10, 1)` thinking that maybe the issue is that the model doesn't know how to handle the extra dimension, but that didn't fix the problem. Any ideas on what might be causing this?

Answer: The error message you see suggests that there is a mismatch between the shape of your input data and the shape expected by the model.

In your case, the input data has a shape of (10,) which means it is a 1D array of length 10. However, the first dense layer expects an input shape of (None, 10) which means it expects a 2D array with shape (batch_size, 10) where batch_size is a variable that represents the number of samples in a batch.

To fix this issue, you can reshape your input data to have a shape of (None, 10) before passing it to the model. You can do this by calling the `reshape()` method on the input data:
```
X_train = X_train.reshape((-1, 10))
X_test = X_test.reshape((-1, 10))
```
This will reshape the input data to have a shape of (None, 10) which should match the expected input shape of the model.

Alternatively, you can also specify the input shape when defining the model, like this:
```
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 1)))
```
This will tell Keras that the input data has a shape of (10, 1) and the model will expect this shape as input.
