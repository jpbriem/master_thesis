This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the game of life. The first line of each example is the initial state of the grid, and the second line is the expected final state. The `train` keyword indicates that the following lines are part of the training data, while the `test` keyword indicates that the following lines are part of the test data.

The game of life is a simple cellular automaton where the state of each cell (represented by a 1 or a 0) changes based on the states of its neighbors. The rules for updating the state of a cell are as follows:

* If a cell is alive (1) and has two or three alive neighbors, it stays alive in the next generation.
* If a cell is alive and has fewer than two alive neighbors, it dies (underpopulation).
* If a cell is alive and has more than three alive neighbors, it dies (overpopulation).
* If a cell is dead (0) and has exactly three alive neighbors, it becomes alive (reproduction).

Your task is to predict the final state of the grid given the initial state. In this case, you have been provided with some examples of the game of life, both for training and testing purposes. Your goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the final state of the grid for any valid initial state.
