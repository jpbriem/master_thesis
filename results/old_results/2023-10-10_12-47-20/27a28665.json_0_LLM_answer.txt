In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs that the model should learn from. Each example consists of an input (a list of three numbers) and an output (a single number). The model should learn to predict the output given the input.

The first line of each example is the input, and the second line is the output. For example, in the first example, the input is `[5, 5, 0]` and the output is `1`.

After all the examples, there is a single test input, which the model should be able to predict the output for. In this case, the test input is `[0, 8, 0]`, and the expected output is `3`.

Your task is to write a program that can read this file and learn the pattern between the inputs and outputs, so that it can predict the output for the test input. You can use any machine learning library or framework you prefer, as long as you can read the input file and produce the predicted output for the test input.
