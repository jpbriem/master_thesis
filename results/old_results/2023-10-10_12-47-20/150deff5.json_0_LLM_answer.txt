I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to overfitting. Your model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data (test data). To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. L1 and L2 regularization are common choices. This will help prevent extreme values for the weights and improve generalization.
2. Dropout: Introduce dropout layers in your model to randomly set a fraction of the neurons to zero during training. This forces the model to learn multiple representations and reduces overfitting.
3. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Batch Normalization: Use batch normalization layers in your model. Batch normalization helps to reduce overfitting by normalizing the inputs to each layer, which can help the model generalize better.
5. Reduce model complexity: Try reducing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer. A simpler model may generalize better than a complex one.
6. Increase the amount of data: If possible, collect more data to train your model. A larger dataset can help the model generalize better.
7. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to the training data, such as flipping, rotating, adding noise, etc. This can help increase the size of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.

It's worth noting that there is no single solution that works best for all cases, and you may need to try a combination of these techniques to find the best approach for your specific problem.
