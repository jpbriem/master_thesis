\end{code}

This is an IPython notebook that contains a simple neural network with one hidden layer and a softmax output layer. The model is trained on a dataset of binary classification problems, where the input is a vector of 16 values, and the output is either 0 or 8. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

The notebook first imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and TensorFlow. It then defines the function `build_model`, which creates the neural network model using the Keras API of TensorFlow. The model has one hidden layer with 32 units and uses the ReLU activation function. The output layer uses the softmax function to produce a probability distribution over the two classes.

The notebook then loads the training data from a CSV file and preprocesses it by normalizing the input values to have zero mean and unit variance. The model is trained on the preprocessed data using the `fit` method, and the loss and accuracy are printed after each epoch. Early stopping is implemented by monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training when the loss stops improving for 5 consecutive epochs.

Finally, the notebook tests the trained model on a sample input and outputs the predicted class probabilities.
