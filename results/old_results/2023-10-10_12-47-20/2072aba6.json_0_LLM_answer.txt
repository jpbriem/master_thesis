End of file.

The format of the file is as follows:

* The first line contains the number of training examples, followed by a comma-separated list of input features for each example.
* Each subsequent line contains a target output for the corresponding input.
* The last line contains the number of test examples, followed by a comma-separated list of input features for each example.
* The target output for the test examples is not provided.

In this case, we have three training examples and one test example. The input features are represented as integers, and the target output is also an integer.

To use this file in scikit-learn, you can use the `load_file` function to read the data from the file and then preprocess it using the `preprocessing` module. Here's an example code snippet:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_file
from sklearn.preprocessing import Preprocessing

# Load the data from the file
data = load_file('my_data.txt')

# Preprocess the data
preprocessor = Preprocessing(remove_ duplicates=True)
X = preprocessor.fit_transform(data.iloc[:, :-1])
y = preprocessor.fit_transform(data.iloc[:, -1])

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```
In this example, we load the data from the file using `load_file`, and then preprocess it using `Preprocessing`. We remove duplicate rows and transform the data into a matrix where each row represents a single input vector. We then split the data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.
