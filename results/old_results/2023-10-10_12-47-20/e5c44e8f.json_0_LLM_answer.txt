This is an IPython notebook that contains a dataset for training and testing a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset consists of 16 examples, with 4 images per example, and each image is represented as a 10-dimensional vector (i.e., a 10-pixel grayscale image). The task is to classify the handwritten digit into one of the 10 possible classes (0 through 9).

The first section of the code defines the training data, which consists of 8 examples with their corresponding labels (0 through 7). The second section defines the test data, which consists of 8 additional examples without labels.

To use this dataset in TensorFlow, you can load the data into memory using the `numpy` library and then pass it to a TensorFlow `tf.data.Dataset` object to create a dataset that can be used for training and testing. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the training data from the file
train_data = np.load("handwritten_digits_train.npy")

# Define the label mapping for the training data
label_map = {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9}

# Create a TensorFlow dataset from the training data
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(train_data)
train_dataset = train_dataset.batch(4).map(lambda x: (x, label_map[x]))

# Load the test data from the file
test_data = np.load("handwritten_digits_test.npy")

# Create a TensorFlow dataset from the test data
test_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(test_data)
```
In this example, we loaded the training and test data from files using `np.load`, and then created TensorFlow datasets from them using `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`. We also defined a label mapping for the training data so that we can convert the raw pixel values into class labels. Finally, we batched the training data into chunks of size 4 and applied the label mapping to create a dataset that can be used for training.
