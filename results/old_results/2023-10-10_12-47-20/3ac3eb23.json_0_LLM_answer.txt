I'm trying to use the `keras.Sequential` model and compile it with a loss function and an optimizer, but I keep getting this error message:

\begin{blockquote}
ValueError: Error when checking target for broadcastability: Target shape (10,) does not match broadcastable shape (None, 10)
\end{blockquote}

Here is my code so far:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import numpy as np

# Load data
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# One-hot encode categorical variables
le = LabelEncoder()
X_train = le.fit_transform(train_data.drop(['output'], axis=1))
y_train = to_categorical(train_data['output'])
X_test = le.transform(test_data.drop(['output'], axis=1))
y_test = to_categorical(test_data['output'])

# Define model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```
I have tried changing the `input_shape` parameter in the first dense layer to `(10,)` and also tried using `keras.backend.tensorflow.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.StringInputLayer` instead of `Dense`, but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me resolve this issue?

Answer: The error message you're seeing suggests that the target shape of your model is not compatible with the broadcasting rules of Keras. This usually happens when the target shape of your model is not consistent with the number of outputs expected by the loss function.

In your case, the target shape of your model is `(10,)`, which means that the model expects 10 output values for each input. However, the loss function `categorical_crossentropy` expects a binary vector as output, which means that the target shape should be `(1, 10)` or `(10, 1)`.

To fix this issue, you can reshape the output of your model to have a shape of `(1, 10)` or `(10, 1)` by adding a `Flatten` layer at the end of your model. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to add a `Flatten` layer:
```python
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
model.add(Flatten())  # Add a Flatten layer at the end of the model
```
