The task is to determine the value of the `?` symbols in the test output. To do this, you need to figure out the rule that the AI uses to map inputs to outputs. The training data provides examples of inputs and corresponding correct outputs, which can be used to infer the rule.

Once you have determined the rule, you can apply it to the test input to get the desired output. In this case, the test input is `6, 7, 7, 6`, `6, 7, 6, 7`, `7, 7, 7, 6`, and `7, 6, 7, 6`. Your goal is to fill in the blanks with the correct values for the `?` symbols in the test output.
