In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs that the model should learn from. Each example consists of an input (a list of three numbers) and an output (a single number). The model should learn to predict the output given the input.

The first line of each example is the input, and the second line is the output. For example, in the first example, the input is `5, 5, 0`, and the output is `1`.

At the end of the training data, there are a few lines that start with `test input:` and contain a single example for the model to predict. This is the test data that we will use to evaluate the performance of our model.

Now that we have our training and test data, we can create a Python script to load the data, define the model architecture, and train the model. Here's an example script that you can use as a starting point:
```
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the training data
train_data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', dtype=np.int32, skiprows=1)

# Define the model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(3,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, epochs=100)

# Evaluate the model on the test data
test_data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', dtype=np.int32, skiprows=1)
test_loss = model.evaluate(test_data)
print(f'Test loss: {test_loss}')
```
This script assumes that the training and test data are stored in a CSV file called `data.csv` in the same directory as the script. It loads the data using the `numpy.loadtxt` function, defines a simple neural network model using the Keras API, compiles the model, trains it on the training data, and evaluates its performance on the test data using the `model.evaluate` method.

Note that this is just one possible way to approach this problem. There are many other architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization algorithms that you could try to improve the performance of the model.
