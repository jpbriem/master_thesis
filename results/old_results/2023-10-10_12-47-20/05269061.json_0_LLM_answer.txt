This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `keras` library to create a simple neural network that can recognize handwritten digits. The notebook includes examples of how to load and preprocess data, define the architecture of the neural network, compile the model with a loss function and optimizer, and train the model on a synthetic dataset. It also includes test cases to verify that the model is working correctly.

The notebook first loads the necessary libraries, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `keras`. It then defines a function called `load_data` that loads a dataset of handwritten digits from a file named `handwritten_digits.csv`. The function preprocesses the data by normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1.

Next, the notebook defines a function called `build_model` that creates a simple neural network architecture using the `Sequential` model class from `keras`. The architecture consists of three layers: a convolutional layer with 64 filters and a kernel size of 3x3, followed by two fully connected layers with 128 units each. The model uses the ReLU activation function and is compiled with the Adam optimizer and a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

The notebook then defines a function called `train_model` that trains the model on the synthetic dataset generated by the `generate_samples` function. The function iterates over the training data in batches, using the `fit` method to update the model's weights after each iteration.

Finally, the notebook includes several test cases to verify that the model is working correctly. These include testing the model's accuracy on the training data, as well as its ability to generalize to new data.
