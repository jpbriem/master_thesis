I'm trying to use the `fit()` method on a neural network to learn from this data and make predictions on new data. However, I keep getting an error message that says "shape too large". Here is my code so far:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Load data
train_input = np.loadtxt('train_input.csv', dtype=np.int8)
train_output = np.loadtxt('train_output.csv', dtype=np.int8)
test_input = np.loadtxt('test_input.csv', dtype=np.int8)

# Preprocess data
train_input = train_input.reshape(-1, 9)
train_output = train_output.reshape(-1, 3)
test_input = test_input.reshape(-1, 9)

# Create neural network model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(3,), activation='relu', solver='adam')

# Fit model to training data
model.fit(train_input, train_output)

# Make predictions on test data
predictions = model.predict(test_input)
```
Can anyone help me figure out what is causing this error and how to fix it?

Answer: The error "shape too large" suggests that the input data you are providing to the `fit()` method is too large for the model to handle. This can happen when the number of input features or samples is very high, and the model is not able to process them all.

In your case, the issue might be with the shape of the `train_input` array, which has a size of `-1, 9`, indicating that it has a single row with 9 columns. The `MLPClassifier` model expects a 2D array as input, with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples (rows) and `n_features` is the number of features (columns).

To resolve this issue, you can try reshaping the `train_input` array to have more than one row. For example, you can split the data into training and validation sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn library, like this:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(train_input, train_output, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
This will split the data into two parts: `X_train` and `y_train` for training, and `X_val` and `y_val` for validation. You can then use `X_train` and `y_train` to fit the model, like this:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
Alternatively, if you don't want to split the data, you can try increasing the number of hidden layers in the model, which can help the model handle larger inputs. For example:
```python
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(3, 3), activation='relu', solver='adam')
```
This will add another hidden layer to the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns in the data. However, keep in mind that increasing the number of hidden layers can
