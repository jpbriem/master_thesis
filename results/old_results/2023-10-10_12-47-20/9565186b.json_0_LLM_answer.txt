I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many local minima. This means that during training, the weights are getting stuck in a suboptimal solution instead of converging to the global minimum.

To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. This will prevent the weights from becoming too large and encourage the network to find a simpler solution.
2. Batch normalization: Normalize the inputs to each layer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This will reduce the effect of internal covariate shift and improve the generalization of the network.
3. Dropout: Randomly drop out neurons during training to prevent the network from relying too heavily on any single neuron. This will force the network to learn multiple representations of the data and improve its ability to generalize.
4. Increase the number of epochs: Train the network for more epochs to give it more time to converge to the global minimum.
5. Use a different optimizer: Try using a different optimizer such as Adam or RMSProp instead of SGD. These optimizers have built-in mechanisms for adjusting the learning rate and can help the network escape local minima.
6. Learning rate schedule: Implement a learning rate schedule to gradually decrease the learning rate over time. This will prevent the network from getting stuck in a local minimum due to a high learning rate.
7. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and adding noise to the input data. This will increase the size of the training set and improve the network's ability to generalize.

By applying these techniques, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network and achieve better results on the test set.
