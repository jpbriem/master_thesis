In this case, we have a sequence of inputs and outputs that are provided as examples for the model to learn from. Each input is a vector of three values, and each output is a vector of six values. The goal is to learn a mapping from the input vectors to the output vectors.

To train the model, we would use the `fit` method on the `keras.Sequential` model, passing in the training data as a tuple of input and output tensors. For example:
```
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```
Here, `X_train` and `y_train` are the training input and output tensors, respectively, and `epochs` specifies the number of times to iterate over the training data during training.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new input data using the `predict` method. For example:
```
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
Here, `X_test` is a tensor representing the test input data, and `predictions` will be a tensor representing the predicted output values.
