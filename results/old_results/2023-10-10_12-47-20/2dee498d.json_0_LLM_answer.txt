In this case we have a dataset with two classes (0 and 1) and four features (2, 4, 1 and 5). The first three lines are the input data for the training set, followed by the corresponding output. Then there is a line saying "End of example" to indicate that the current batch of input-output pairs has been processed.

The next block of input data is the test set, which consists of four input vectors and their corresponding outputs. Again, there is a line saying "End of example" to indicate that all the input-output pairs have been given.

To summarize, the format of the file is as follows:

* Train input: <input vector 1>, <input vector 2>,..., <input vector n>
* Train output: <output vector 1>, <output vector 2>,..., <output vector m>
* End of example
* Repeat the above steps for the test set.

Note that the number of input vectors (n) may be different from the number of output vectors (m), but they should be consistent within each set (i.e., all input vectors in the train set should have the same length, and all output vectors in the train set should have the same length).
