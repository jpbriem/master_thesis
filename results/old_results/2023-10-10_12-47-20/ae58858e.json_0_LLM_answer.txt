I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many inputs and outputs for the number of examples provided. With only 14 examples, it's difficult for the model to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To address this, you can try reducing the number of inputs and outputs or increasing the number of examples. Here are some suggestions:

1. Reduce the number of inputs: You can try reducing the number of inputs by combining some of the features. For example, you could combine the first three features (0, 0, 0) into a single feature, which would reduce the number of inputs to 5.
2. Increase the number of examples: You can try generating more examples using the existing data. For example, you could create new examples by adding noise to the existing data or by applying transformations to the data.
3. Use a simpler model: You can try using a simpler model such as a linear regression or a decision tree. These models are less complex than a neural network and may be able to learn from the limited number of examples.
4. Use transfer learning: If you have a small dataset, you can use pre-trained models that have been trained on large datasets and fine-tune them on your dataset. This can help the model learn relevant features from the large dataset and adapt to your smaller dataset.
5. Ensemble methods: You can try using ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting to combine multiple models trained on your dataset. This can help improve the accuracy of the model by reducing overfitting.

Remember that deep learning models require a lot of data to learn and generalize well. If you don't have enough data, it's better to use a simpler model that can learn from the available data.
