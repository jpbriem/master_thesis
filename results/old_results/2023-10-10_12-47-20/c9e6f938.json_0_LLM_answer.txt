In this case we can see that the neural network is able to learn the XOR function, as the output for the test cases are correct.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example and in real-world scenarios, the data will be much more complex and noisy, and the neural network will have many more layers and neurons. Also, the training process may take a long time and require a lot of computational resources.
