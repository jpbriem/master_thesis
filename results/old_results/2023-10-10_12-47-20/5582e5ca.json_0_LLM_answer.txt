In this case, we can see that the neural network is able to learn the pattern in the training data and produce the correct output for the test data as well. The network has learned to recognize the pattern of numbers and produce the corresponding output.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example and in real-world scenarios, the data is usually much more complex and the patterns much harder to recognize. Additionally, the neural network architecture used in this example is also very simple and in real-world scenarios, more complex architectures are used to solve more complex problems.
