In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs for the function we want to learn. Each example consists of three numbers as input and three corresponding numbers as output. The last line of the file contains the test input, which is a set of three numbers for which we want to predict the output.

To use this file to train a neural network in Python using Keras, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Keras: You can install Keras using pip by running the following command: `pip install keras`.
2. Import necessary libraries: You need to import the following libraries: `numpy`, `keras`, and `matplotlib` (for visualization).
3. Load the data: You can load the data from the file using the `numpy.loadtxt` function. For example:
```
import numpy as np

# Load the data from the file
data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', dtype=int, delimiter=',')
```
This will load the data from the file 'data.csv' into a NumPy array called `data`. The `dtype` parameter specifies that each element in the array should be an integer, and the `delimiter` parameter specifies that the elements are separated by commas.

4. Preprocess the data: You may need to preprocess the data before feeding it to the neural network. For example, if the inputs and outputs are integers, you may want to normalize them to have values between 0 and 1.
```
# Normalize the inputs and outputs
inputs = data[:, :2] / 10
outputs = data[:, 2:] / 10
```
This will divide each element in the first two columns of the data array by 10 and store the result in the `inputs` variable, and do the same for the last column and store the result in the `outputs` variable.

5. Split the data into training and testing sets: You can split the data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn library. For example:
```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(inputs, outputs, test_size=0.2)
```
This will split the input data (`inputs`) and output data (`outputs`) into two parts: a training set (80% of the data) and a testing set (20% of the data). The `test_size` parameter specifies the proportion of the data that should be used for testing.

6. Define the neural network architecture: You can define a simple neural network architecture using the Sequential model from Keras. For example:
```
# Define the neural network architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))
```
This defines a neural network with two hidden layers and one output layer. The first hidden layer has 64 neurons, uses the ReLU activation function, and takes two inputs. The second hidden layer also has 64 neurons, uses the ReLU activation function, and takes the output of the first hidden layer as input. The output layer has one neuron, uses the linear activation function (i.e., it outputs the output directly), and takes the output of the second hidden layer as input.

7. Compile the model: After defining the neural network architecture, you need to compile the model. For example:
```
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```
This specifies that the optimizer used for training should be Adam, and the loss function used for training should be mean squared error.

8. Train the model: Next, you can train the model using the training data. For example:
```
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```
This trains the model on the training data for 100 epochs, using the validation data for evaluation.

9. Evaluate the model: Finally, you can evaluate the model on the testing data. For example:
