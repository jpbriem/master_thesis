This is a simple neural network that takes in 9 inputs and outputs 9 outputs. The training data consists of 5 examples, each with 9 inputs and 9 corresponding outputs. The test data consists of 2 examples, each with 9 inputs and 9 corresponding outputs.

To use this dataset, you can preprocess the data by normalizing the inputs to have zero mean and unit variance. You can then split the data into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. For example:
```
from sklearn.datasets import load_csv
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_csv('data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(dataset.iloc[:, :-1])
y = scaler.inverse_transform(dataset.iloc[:, -1])

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```
This will give you `X_train` and `y_train` as the training data, and `X_val` and `y_val` as the validation data. You can then use these datasets to train and evaluate your neural network model.
