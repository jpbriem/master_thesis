I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to overfitting. Your model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data (test data). To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. L1 and L2 regularization are common choices. This will help prevent extreme values for the weights and improve generalization.
2. Dropout: Introduce dropout layers in your model to randomly set a fraction of the neurons to zero during training. This forces the model to learn multiple representations and reduces overfitting.
3. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Batch Normalization: Use batch normalization layers in your model. These layers normalize the inputs to each layer, which helps reduce overfitting by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the generalization of the model.
5. Reduce Model Complexity: Try reducing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer. A simpler model may generalize better than a complex one.
6. Data Augmentation: Increase the size of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to the images. This can help the model generalize better to new data.
7. Ensemble Methods: Train multiple models with different architectures, hyperparameters, or initializations. Combine their predictions using methods like bagging or boosting to improve generalization.
8. Change Optimizer: Try using a different optimizer, such as Adam, RMSProp, or SGD with a decaying learning rate. This may help the model converge to a better local minimum and improve generalization.
9. Learning Rate Schedule: Implement a learning rate schedule to gradually decrease the learning rate during training. This can help prevent overshooting and improve convergence.
10. More Data: If possible, collect more data to increase the size of the training set. This can help the model generalize better to new data.

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to avoid overfitting. It's essential to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their impact on your specific problem.
