This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of MNIST data, which is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The data consists of 28x28 images of handwritten digits (0-9), along with their corresponding labels (0-9).

The notebook first loads the MNIST dataset and splits it into training and test sets. It then defines a simple neural network model with one hidden layer containing 128 units, and trains it on the training set using the `fit` method.

After training, the notebook tests the model on the test set and displays the predicted outputs alongside the true labels. Finally, it shows some sample inputs and expected outputs to demonstrate how the model works.

Note that this is just a basic example, and there are many ways to improve upon this code, such as using more complex models, preprocessing the data, or experimenting with different hyperparameters.
