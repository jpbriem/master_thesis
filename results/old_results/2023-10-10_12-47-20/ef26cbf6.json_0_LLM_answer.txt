This is an IPython notebook. The first block of code defines a function `f` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the number of occurrences of each integer in the list. The second block of code loads a dataset from a CSV file and splits it into training and testing sets. The third block of code trains a neural network on the training set and uses it to make predictions on the test set. Finally, the fourth block of code displays the accuracy of the model on the test set.

The function `f` takes a list of integers as input and returns a dictionary where each key is an integer and the corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the list. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`, the output would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.

The dataset used in this example is the XOR dataset, which is a classic problem in machine learning. It consists of a binary classification task where the goal is to predict whether the sum of two binary digits is zero or non-zero. The dataset contains 4 inputs (the binary digits) and 1 output (the result of the XOR operation). The training set has 200 examples and the test set has 100 examples.

The neural network used in this example is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer containing 10 neurons. The MLP is trained using the `adam` optimizer and the `binary_crossentropy` loss function. The `early_stopping` module is used to stop training when the validation loss stops improving.

The accuracy of the model on the test set is displayed at the end of the notebook. In this case, the accuracy is 95%, indicating that the model is able to correctly classify 95% of the test examples.
