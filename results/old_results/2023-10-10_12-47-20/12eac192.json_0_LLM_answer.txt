This is a classic problem known as the "traffic light problem" or "traffic signal control problem". It's an example of a Markov decision process (MDP), which is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making problems in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of the decision-maker. The goal is to find a policy that maps states to actions that maximizes some measure of performance or reward. In this case, the reward is simply the number of cars that get through the intersection without crashing.

The MDP for this problem can be represented by a transition diagram, which shows all possible transitions between states and the probabilities of taking each action in each state. From there, we can use dynamic programming algorithms like value iteration or policy iteration to compute an optimal policy.

Here's a simple way to represent the MDP for this problem:

* States: S = {s0, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7}
* Actions: A = {a0, a1, a2, a3}
* Transition probabilities: P(s'|s, a) = probability of transitioning from state s to state s' when taking action a
* Rewards: R(s, a, s') = reward associated with transitioning from state s to state s' when taking action a

We can represent the transition probabilities and rewards using the following table:

| State | Action | Next State | Probability | Reward |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| s0 | a0 | s1 | 0.5 | 1 |
| s0 | a1 | s2 | 0.5 | 2 |
| s1 | a0 | s3 | 0.7 | 3 |
| s1 | a1 | s4 | 0.3 | 4 |
| s2 | a0 | s5 | 0.8 | 5 |
| s2 | a1 | s6 | 0.2 | 6 |
| s3 | a0 | s7 | 0.9 | 7 |
| s3 | a1 | s0 | 0.1 | 0 |
| s4 | a0 | s1 | 0.5 | 1 |
| s4 | a1 | s2 | 0.5 | 2 |
| s5 | a0 | s3 | 0.7 | 3 |
| s5 | a1 | s4 | 0.3 | 4 |
| s6 | a0 | s2 | 0.8 | 5 |
| s6 | a1 | s1 | 0.2 | 6 |
| s7 | a0 | s0 | 0.9 | 7 |
| s7 | a1 | s3 | 0.1 | 0 |

The optimal policy for this MDP can be computed using dynamic programming algorithms like value iteration or policy iteration. The optimal policy tells us which action to take in each state to maximize the expected cumulative reward over an infinite horizon.

For example, the optimal policy for this MDP might look something like this:

* s0: a0 with probability 0.7, a1 with probability 0.3
* s1: a0 with probability 0.5, a1 with probability 0.5
* s2: a0 with probability 0.8, a1 with probability 0.2
* s3: a0 with probability 0.7, a1 with probability 0.3
* s
