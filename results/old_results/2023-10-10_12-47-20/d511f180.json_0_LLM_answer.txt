I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different algorithms and techniques but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me with this?

Comment: It looks like you are trying to solve a classic problem in computer science called the "traveling salesman problem" (TSP). The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits all the given cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

There are several approaches to solving TSP, including exact methods (such as branch and bound), heuristics (such as nearest neighbor and 2-opt), and metaheuristics (such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing).

Which approach have you tried so far? And what is the size of the problem (i.e., number of cities) that you are trying to solve?

Answer: Thank you for your response. I apologize for the confusion, but my question was not related to the Traveling Salesman Problem. My apologies for the mistake.

The problem I am facing is actually a coding challenge from HackerRank. The task is to write a program that takes two inputs - a list of integers representing a sequence of numbers, and a list of pairs of integers representing a sequence of intervals. The goal is to print the maximum sum of the intervals that can be covered by the sequence of numbers.

Here's an example of the input and output:

Input:
[2, 7, 8, 8, 8]
[[2, 7], [5, 5], [8, 8], [8, 8], [5, 2]]

Output:
23

Explanation:
The sequence of numbers is [2, 7, 8, 8, 8]. The sequence of intervals is [[2, 7], [5, 5], [8, 8], [8, 8], [5, 2]]. The maximum sum of the intervals that can be covered by the sequence of numbers is 23, which is achieved by covering the intervals in the following order: [2, 7], [5, 5], [8, 8], [8, 8], [5, 2].

I have tried various approaches, such as sorting the intervals by their start points and then iterating through them, or using dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum for each interval. However, none of these approaches seem to work for all test cases.

Can you please provide some guidance on how to approach this problem?
