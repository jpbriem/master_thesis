This is an IPython notebook that contains a dataset for training a neural network to play tic-tac-toe. The dataset consists of input vectors and corresponding output vectors. The input vectors are 9-dimensional, representing the state of a tic-tac-toe board (with each dimension corresponding to a cell on the board), and the output vectors are 3-dimensional, representing the three possible moves that can be made from that state (i.e., left, middle, and right).

The notebook provides five examples of input-output pairs, with the first four being training examples and the fifth one being a test example. Each example is represented as a pair of matrices, with the first matrix being the input vector and the second matrix being the corresponding output vector.

For example, in the first training example, the input vector is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (representing an empty tic-tac-toe board) and the output vector is `[2, 2, 2]` (representing the three possible moves that can be made from this state). Similarly, in the second training example, the input vector is `[0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0]` (representing a tic-tac-toe board with two "X"s in the top row and one "O" in the middle row) and the output vector is `[2, 0, 2]` (representing the three possible moves that can be made from this state).

The last example is a test example, which does not have a corresponding output vector. This is because the neural network being trained will be tested on this example to see how well it performs.
