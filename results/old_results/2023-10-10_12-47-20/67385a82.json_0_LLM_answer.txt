The format is the same as before, but this time it's for a neural network that takes 5 inputs and produces 5 outputs. The `train input` and `train output` sections are separated by an `End of example` line, and the `test input` and `test output` sections are separated by an `End of test case` line.

To use this file to train a neural network in Python using Keras, you can use the following code:
```
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Load the training data
train_data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Preprocess the input data
X = train_data.iloc[:, :-1].values.reshape(-1, 5)
y = train_data.iloc[:, -1].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# One-hot encode the output data
y = to_categorical(y)

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(5, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X_test = test_data.iloc[:, :-1].values.reshape(-1, 5)
y_test = test_data.iloc[:, -1].values.reshape(-1, 1)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
This code first loads the training data from a CSV file called `data.csv`. It then preprocesses the input data by reshaping it into a matrix with shape `(samples, features)` and normalizes the values to be between 0 and 1. The output data is one-hot encoded to have 5 classes.

Next, the code defines a neural network architecture with two hidden layers and an output layer. The first hidden layer has 64 units, uses the ReLU activation function, and takes the input data as its input. The second hidden layer also has 64 units, uses the ReLU activation function, and takes the output of the first hidden layer as its input. The output layer has 5 units, uses the softmax activation function, and outputs a vector of probabilities for each class.

The model is then compiled with the categorical cross-entropy loss function, the Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric. It is trained on the training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a validation split of 0.2.

Finally, the code evaluates the model on the test set by predicting the probabilities for each sample and computing the accuracy score. The result is printed to the console.
