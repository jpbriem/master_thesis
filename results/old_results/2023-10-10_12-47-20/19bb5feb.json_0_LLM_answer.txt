This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples for training a Markov chain model on a grid-based environment. The first section defines the state and action spaces, as well as the transition probabilities and reward function for the environment. The second section provides several examples of states and actions, along with their corresponding rewards and next states. The third section tests the reader's understanding by providing a set of inputs and asking them to predict the outputs. Finally, the fourth section provides the correct answers for the test cases.

The environment in this case consists of a 3x3 grid, where each cell can be in one of three states (empty, occupied, or blocked). The agent can move up, down, left, or right, and its goal is to reach the opposite corner of the grid from its starting position. The reward function assigns a positive reward for moving towards the goal and a negative reward for moving away from it. If the agent moves into a blocked cell, it receives a penalty reward.

The Markov chain model is trained using the REINFORCE algorithm, which updates the policy based on the difference between the expected and observed rewards. The policy is represented as a table that specifies the probability of taking each possible action given the current state.

Overall, this notebook provides a simple but complete introduction to reinforcement learning and Markov chains, including both theoretical concepts and practical implementation. It also includes some challenges and quizzes to help readers solidify their understanding.
