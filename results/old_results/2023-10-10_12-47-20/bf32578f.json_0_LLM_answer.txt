This is a simple neural network that takes in 8 binary inputs and outputs a single binary value. The training data consists of 3 examples, each with 8 input values and their corresponding output values. The test data also consists of 8 input values, but no output values are provided. Your task is to train the neural network using the given training data and then use it to predict the output values for the test data.

To help you get started, we'll give you a hint: the first layer of the neural network should have 8 neurons (one for each input), and the second layer should have 1 neuron (one for the output). You can use the sigmoid activation function for the first layer and the linear activation function for the second layer.

Once you think you have a good solution, you can submit your answer. We'll evaluate your submission using the mean squared error (MSE) between your predicted output values and the actual output values for the test data. Good luck!
