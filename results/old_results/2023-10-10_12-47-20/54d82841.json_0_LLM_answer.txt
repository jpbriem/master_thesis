This is a simple neural network that takes an 8-dimensional input vector and outputs a single number. The training data consists of pairs of input vectors and corresponding output numbers. The goal is to learn a mapping from the input space to the output space such that the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

In this case, the training data contains three examples, each with eight input values and one output value. The first example has inputs 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0 and output 6, the second example has inputs 0, 3, 3, 3, 0 and output 3, and the third example has inputs 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 and output 0.

The test data consists of one example with ten input values (0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and no output value. This is used to evaluate the performance of the model on new data that it hasn't seen before.
