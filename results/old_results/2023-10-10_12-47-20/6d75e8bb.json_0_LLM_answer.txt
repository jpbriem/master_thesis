I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example per batch, which can cause the model to overfit to the training data. This is known as "overfitting to the training set" and can result in poor performance on unseen data (such as the test set).

To address this issue, you can try increasing the number of examples per batch during training. You can do this by setting the `batch_size` parameter in your `TrainingArguments` object to a value greater than 1. For example:
```
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    save_total_limit=2,
    save_steps=500,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    metric_for_best_model="accuracy",
    greater_is_better=True,
    save_strategy="steps",
    save_on_each_node=True,
)
```
In this example, the `per_device_train_batch_size` parameter has been increased from 1 to 16. This means that each device will process 16 examples in parallel before updating the model parameters. By doing so, you are effectively increasing the amount of data used for training, which can help to reduce overfitting.

Additionally, you may also want to consider using techniques such as regularization, early stopping, or dropout to further prevent overfitting. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, while early stopping stops training when the validation loss stops improving. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons to zero during training, effectively creating an ensemble of different sub-networks.

It's worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to avoid overfitting, and the best approach will depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve. Experimenting with different techniques and evaluating their impact on your specific task can help you find the optimal balance between underfitting and overfitting.
