In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and three outputs. The training data consists of six examples, each with three input values and three corresponding output values. The first three examples are used to train the network, while the last three examples are used for testing.

The first line of the file contains the number of inputs (three), the number of hidden units (two), and the number of outputs (three). The next six lines contain the training data, with each line representing one example. Each example consists of three input values, followed by three output values. The last three lines contain the test data, with each line representing one example.

To use this file to train a neural network in Python, you can use the following code:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the data from the file
data = np.loadtxt('data.csv', dtype=np.float32)

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[:6], data[6:], test_size=0.2)

# Scale the data using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train a neural network using MLPClassifier
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(2,), activation='relu', solver='adam')
clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to load the data from the file, and the `sklearn` library to split the data into training and test sets, scale the data using StandardScaler, and train a neural network using MLPClassifier. The accuracy of the model is then calculated using the `accuracy_score` function from `sklearn`.
