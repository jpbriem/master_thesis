This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples and a test case for the 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The examples are provided as input data for the model, and the corresponding output data is also given. The test case is a set of input data that the model should be able to process correctly.

The first example has four inputs: `0`, `7`, `0`, and `7`. The expected output for this example is:
```
0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7
0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
```
The second example has three inputs: `0`, `6`, and `0`. The expected output for this example is:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6
0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
```
The third example has three inputs: `4`, `4`, and `0`. The expected output for this example is:
```
0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0
0, 0,
