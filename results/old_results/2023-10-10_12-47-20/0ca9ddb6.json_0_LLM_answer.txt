This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a simple neural network with two inputs, three hidden units, and one output. The network is trained on a dataset containing four examples, and it is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first line imports the necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Keras.
2. The next block of code loads the data from a CSV file called "data.csv". This file contains the input and output data for the neural network.
3. The data is then preprocessed by splitting it into training and testing sets, scaling the values to be between 0 and 1, and converting the data types to integers.
4. The neural network architecture is defined using the Keras functional API. The `input_layer` function creates an input layer with two neurons, and the `dense` function creates three hidden layers with 16, 32, and 16 neurons respectively. The `output_layer` function creates an output layer with one neuron.
5. The network is compiled with a loss function (mean squared error), an optimizer (adam), and metrics (accuracy).
6. The network is trained on the training data using the `fit` method.
7. Finally, the performance of the network is evaluated on the test data using the `evaluate` method.

This is just a simple example to demonstrate the basic steps involved in creating and training a neural network using the Keras functional API. You can modify the architecture, hyperparameters, and data to suit your specific needs.
