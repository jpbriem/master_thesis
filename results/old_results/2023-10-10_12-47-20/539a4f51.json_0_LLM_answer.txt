This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `keras` library to create a sequence classification model in Python. The notebook provides examples of how to create a model, compile it, and then train and test it on sample data.

The first part of the notebook imports the necessary libraries and loads the data. It then preprocesses the data by converting the input and output sequences to numerical vectors using the `pad_sequences` function from Keras.

The second part of the notebook creates a sequence classification model using the `Sequential` model class from Keras. It adds layers to the model, including an embedding layer, a flatten layer, and a dense layer. The model is then compiled with a loss function and an optimizer.

The third part of the notebook trains the model on the sample data using the `fit` method. It also displays the training and validation accuracy and loss during training.

The fourth part of the notebook tests the model on sample data using the `evaluate` method. It displays the test accuracy and loss.

The final part of the notebook uses the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Overall, this notebook provides a step-by-step guide for creating and training a sequence classification model using Keras in Python.
