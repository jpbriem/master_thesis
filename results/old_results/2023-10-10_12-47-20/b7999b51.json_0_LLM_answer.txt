\end{code}

I'm trying to use the `fit()` method on a neural network to learn from this data and make predictions on new examples. However, I keep getting an error message that says "shape too large". I've tried reshaping the data in various ways, but nothing seems to work. Can you help me figure out what's going wrong?

Answer: The issue is likely due to the fact that your training data has a shape of `(n_samples, n_features)` where `n_features` is very large (in this case, 100). This can cause problems for some machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, because they require a large amount of computational resources and memory to process such large datasets.

To fix this issue, you can try one or more of the following approaches:

1. Split the data into smaller chunks: Instead of feeding the entire dataset to the neural network at once, split it into smaller chunks and process each chunk separately. For example, you could split the data into chunks of size 1000 samples each and train the network on each chunk separately.
2. Use a smaller neural network architecture: Reduce the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer to reduce the computational requirements of the network.
3. Use regularization techniques: Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights.
4. Use a different optimizer: Some optimizers, such as gradient descent with momentum, are more efficient than others when dealing with large datasets.
5. Increase the batch size: Increasing the batch size can speed up training by allowing the network to process more data in parallel.
6. Use a distributed training framework: Distributed training frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch allow you to distribute the training across multiple machines, which can speed up training time.
7. Use a GPU: Training on a GPU can significantly speed up training time compared to using a CPU alone.

By implementing one or more of these strategies, you should be able to successfully train your neural network on the given data.
