This is a binary classification problem where the model should predict 1 for the positive class and 0 for the negative class. The training data contains five examples with two features (input) and one target variable (output). Each feature has a value of either 0 or 1. The task is to learn a model that can predict the target variable based on the input features.

The first four examples in the training data are simple linear patterns, while the last example is a more complex pattern that includes all possible combinations of the input features. The test data contains eight examples with the same format as the training data.

To solve this problem, you can use various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks. You can also experiment with different evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC, to measure the performance of your model.
