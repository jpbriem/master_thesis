This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples and a test set for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of images of handwritten digits (0-9) that have been preprocessed to be 28x28 grayscale images. Each image has a corresponding label indicating which digit it represents. In this notebook, we're using the `train` and `test` directories from the MNIST dataset as our inputs.

The code in the notebook first loads the data from the `train` directory and splits it into training and validation sets. It then defines two neural networks with different architectures and trains them on the training set. Finally, it tests both networks on the validation set and compares their performance.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first cell imports necessary libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and TensorFlow.
2. The second cell loads the MNIST dataset from the `train` directory and splits it into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function from SciPy.
3. The third cell defines a simple neural network architecture with one hidden layer containing 256 neurons. It also defines a loss function, optimizer, and metric for evaluating the model's performance.
4. The fourth cell trains the network on the training set using the `fit` method.
5. The fifth cell defines a second neural network architecture with two hidden layers, each containing 256 neurons. It also redefines the loss function, optimizer, and metric.
6. The sixth cell trains the second network on the training set using the `fit` method.
7. The seventh cell tests both networks on the validation set using the `evaluate` method and compares their performance using the `accuracy` metric.
8. The final cell displays the test set and outputs the predicted labels for both networks.

Note that this is just an example notebook and you may need to modify the code depending on your specific needs and requirements.
