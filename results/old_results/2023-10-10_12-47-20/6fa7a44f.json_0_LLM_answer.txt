I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using a different algorithm for finding the maximum value in a row but that didn't work either. Any help would be appreciated!

Answer: The issue with your code is that you are comparing elements in the input array with each other, instead of comparing them to the current maximum value in the row. To fix this, you can modify the comparison to check if the current element is greater than the maximum value in the row, and update the maximum value accordingly. Here's an updated version of your code that should pass all tests:
```
function maxInRow(input) {
  let max = -Infinity;
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    const current = input[i];
    if (current > max) {
      max = current;
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```
This function iterates over each element in the input array and compares it to the current maximum value in the row. If the current element is greater than the maximum, it updates the maximum value to the current element. Finally, it returns the maximum value found in the row.

Here's an explanation of the code:

* `let max = -Infinity;` sets the initial value of the maximum to negative infinity, which ensures that it will never be returned as the maximum value.
* `for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++)` loops over each element in the input array.
* `const current = input[i];` retrieves the current element from the input array.
* `if (current > max)` checks if the current element is greater than the current maximum value. If it is, then the maximum value needs to be updated.
* `max = current;` updates the maximum value to the current element.
* `return max;` returns the maximum value found in the row.

With this updated implementation, your function should now pass all tests.
