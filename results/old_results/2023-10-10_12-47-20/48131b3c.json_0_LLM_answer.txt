This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to build a simple neural network that can recognize handwritten digits. The code first imports the necessary libraries and loads the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The `load_data()` function is used to load the training data and labels, and the `preprocess_inputs()` function is used to preprocess the inputs by reshaping them into (28, 28) arrays.

The next step is to define the architecture of the neural network using the Keras functional API. The `Sequential` model is defined, which consists of several layers that are stacked together. In this case, there are two convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by two dense layers with ReLU activation. The `model.compile()` method is then called to specify the loss function, optimizer, and metrics for training.

The `fit()` method is then called to train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs. The `evaluate()` method is used to evaluate the model's performance on the test set after each epoch. Finally, the `predict()` method is used to make predictions on the test set.

The output of the `predict()` method is a tensor with shape `(test_size, 10)`, where each element in the tensor represents a probability distribution over the 10 possible classes (i.e., the 10 handwritten digits). To simplify the output, we use theargmax() function to convert the probabilities to class indices.
