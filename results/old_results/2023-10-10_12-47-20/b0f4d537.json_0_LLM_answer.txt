I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but that didn't seem to work. Any help would be appreciated!

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many inputs and outputs for the number of samples you have. With only 6 examples, it's difficult for the model to learn a meaningful representation of the data. Additionally, the model is over-parameterized, which means it has more parameters than necessary to fit the data, leading to overfitting.

To address this, you can try reducing the number of inputs and outputs, or increasing the number of samples. Here are some suggestions:

1. Reduce the number of inputs: You can try removing some of the input features that don't seem important and see if the model performs better. For example, you can remove the last 4 features (0, 0, 0, 0) from the input data since they always have the value 0. This will reduce the number of inputs from 10 to 6.
2. Reduce the number of outputs: Since the task is a classification problem, you can try reducing the number of outputs to 2 or 3, corresponding to the number of classes. This will simplify the model and make it easier to interpret.
3. Increase the number of samples: If possible, try to obtain more data samples to increase the size of the training set. This will give the model more information to learn from and improve its performance.
4. Use a simpler model architecture: Instead of using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with multiple hidden layers, you can try a simpler architecture such as a linear model or a shallow neural network with only one hidden layer. This will reduce the risk of overfitting and make the model easier to interpret.
5. Regularization: You can also try regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large weights and prevent overfitting.

By applying these changes, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network and achieve better accuracy on the test set.
