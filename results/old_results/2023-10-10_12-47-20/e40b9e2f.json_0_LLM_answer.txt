I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example per batch, which can cause the model to overfit to the training data. To address this, you can try increasing the number of examples per batch by adjusting the `batch_size` parameter in the `TrainingArguments` object.

For example, if you set `batch_size=16`, then each batch will contain 16 examples from the training data, which should provide enough information for the model to learn from. You can also experiment with different values of `batch_size` to find the optimal value for your specific use case.

Additionally, you may want to consider using techniques such as data augmentation or regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of your model. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling) to the existing data, while regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.

Here's an updated version of your code that includes these changes:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from keras.utils import plot_model
from keras.models import load_model
from keras.applications import VGG16
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set up data
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Preprocess data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(train_data.drop(['label'], axis=1))
y_train = to_categorical(train_data['label'])
X_test = scaler.transform(test_data.drop(['label'], axis=1))
y_test = to_categorical(test_data['label'])

# Set up model
input_shape = X_train.shape[1]
output_shape = 10

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(output_shape, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Set up callbacks
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)
model_checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.h5', monitor='val_loss', save
