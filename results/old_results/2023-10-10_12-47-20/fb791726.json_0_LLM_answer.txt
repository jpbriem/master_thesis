This is a simple neural network that takes in 6 inputs and outputs a single value. The training data consists of 12 examples, with the first 4 being "easy" examples where the output is simply a copy of the second input, and the next 8 being "hard" examples where the output is a copy of the fourth input.

The neural network has one hidden layer with 16 neurons, and uses the ReLU activation function. It was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 for 50 epochs.

To generate the output for a given input, you can use the following formula:

output = sigmoid(hidden_layer + bias)

Where hidden_layer is the output of the hidden layer (a vector of 16 values), bias is a vector of 16 values representing the bias of the neurons in the hidden layer, and sigmoid is the sigmoid activation function.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
