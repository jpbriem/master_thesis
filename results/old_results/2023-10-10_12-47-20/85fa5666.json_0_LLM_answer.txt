This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples and tests for a neural network that is designed to solve the "traffic Signal Control" problem. The problem involves predicting the traffic signal timing at an intersection based on various inputs such as the number of cars waiting in each direction, the speed limit, etc.

The notebook starts by importing the necessary libraries and defining the input and output data for the training and testing sets. It then uses the `keras` library to define a neural network model with two hidden layers and an output layer, and compiles it with a loss function and an optimizer.

Next, the notebook trains the model using the training data and evaluates its performance on the test data. Finally, it uses the trained model to make predictions on new input data.

Overall, this notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building and training a neural network for the Traffic Signal Control problem using Keras.
