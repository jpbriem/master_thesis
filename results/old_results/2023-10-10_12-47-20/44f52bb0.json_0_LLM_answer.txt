In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs that the model should learn from. Each example consists of three integers (separated by spaces) representing the inputs, and one integer representing the output. The `train` keyword indicates that these examples are for training the model, while the `test` keyword indicates that the following example is for testing the model.

The first example has inputs `2`, `0`, and `2`, and output `1`. This means that when the model receives these inputs, it should produce output `1`. Similarly, the second example has inputs `2`, `0`, and `0`, and output `7`.

The remaining examples follow the same pattern, with different inputs and outputs. The last example has inputs `2`, `2`, and `2`, and output `7`.

Note that there are five training examples and one test example in this file. When we run the `main.py` script, it will use the training examples to train the model and then evaluate its performance on the test example.
