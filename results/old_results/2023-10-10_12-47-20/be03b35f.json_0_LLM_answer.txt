I'm not sure what the expected output is for the test cases, but it seems like there might be a problem with the way the network is processing the input data. The training data has a lot of repeating values and the network doesn't seem to be able to handle that well.

Also, the architecture of the network seems to be quite simple, it might be worth trying a more complex architecture such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or a convolutional neural network (CNN) to see if they can handle the task better.

Another thing to consider is the optimization algorithm used for training, it looks like the network is being trained using the 'trainer' module from Keras, which uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by default. It might be worth trying a different optimizer, such as Adam or RMSprop, to see if they can converge to a better solution.

It would also be helpful to know more about the problem you are trying to solve, such as what the input data represents and what the desired output should look like. This will help me give you more specific advice on how to improve your model.
