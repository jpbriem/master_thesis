LLM answer:

?
\end{code}

This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of the game Tic-Tac-Toe being played. The first line of each example specifies the current state of the board, and the second line specifies the move made by the player (either X or O). The third line shows the updated state of the board after the move has been made. The fourth line shows the final state of the board, with the winner indicated by a 1 for X or a 2 for O.

The first example shows a simple win for X, where X places their mark in the center square and then waits for O to make their move. O places their mark in one of the corners, and X responds by placing their mark in the adjacent corner, trapping O's mark and winning the game.

The second example shows a simple win for O, where O places their mark in one of the corners and X attempts to trap it but fails. O then places their mark in another corner, trapping X's mark and winning the game.

The third example shows a more complex game where both players make mistakes and the game ends in a draw. X and O alternate turns, each placing their mark in different squares around the board. Eventually, they both miss an opportunity to win and the game ends with no winner.

The fourth example shows a game where X makes a mistake early on and allows O to win easily. X places their mark in one of the corners, but O responds by placing their mark in the center square, trapping X's mark and winning the game quickly.

The fifth example shows a game where O makes a mistake early on and allows X to win easily. O places their mark in one of the corners, but X responds by placing their mark in the adjacent corner, trapping O's mark and winning the game quickly.

The sixth example shows a game where both players play optimally and the game ends in a draw. Each player takes turns placing their mark in different squares around the board, always avoiding the possibility of being trapped. The game ends with neither player having won.

The seventh example shows a game where X makes a mistake late in the game and allows O to win. X and O alternate turns, each placing their mark in different squares around the board. However, X eventually makes a mistake and leaves their mark vulnerable to being trapped by O, who wins the game.

The eighth example shows a game where O makes a mistake late in the game and allows X to win. Like the previous example, X and O alternate turns, each placing their mark in different squares around the board. However, O eventually makes a mistake and leaves their mark vulnerable to being trapped by X, who wins the game.
