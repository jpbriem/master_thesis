The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 3). Each subsequent line contains a triplet of inputs and outputs, where each input is represented as a sequence of letters (e.g., 'a' or 'c'), and each output is also represented as a sequence of letters (e.g., 'g' or 'i'). The last line of the `train` file indicates that there are 3 examples in the training set.

The `test` file contains the same format of lines as the `train` file, but with only 2 examples in the testing set.
