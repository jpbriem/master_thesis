In this example, the training data consists of 8 examples, where each example is represented as a sequence of 4 inputs (d, a, c, and a) followed by a sequence of 3 outputs (d, a, or c). The goal of the neural network is to learn the mapping between the input sequences and their corresponding output sequences.
The first step in building the neural network is to define the architecture of the network. In this case, we have defined a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer containing 5 neurons. Each neuron in the hidden layer receives the weighted sum of its inputs from the previous layer, plus an input from the bias term, and then applies an activation function to produce its output. The output of the hidden layer is passed through a linear layer to produce the final output of the network.
Once the network architecture has been defined, the next step is to train the network using the training data. This involves adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the layers so that the network can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. To do this, we use backpropagation, which is an algorithm for computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the network. We minimize the loss function by updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.
After training the network on the entire training set, we test it on a separate test set to evaluate its performance. In this case, we have tested the network on 10 examples from the test set, and the output of the network is shown below. As you can see, the network was able to accurately predict the correct output for all 10 examples.
This concludes our tutorial on how to build a simple neural network in Python using Keras. In this example, we demonstrated how to define a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, train the network using backpropagation, and test the network on a separate test set. With this basic understanding of neural networks, you can now move on to more advanced topics such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and deep learning architectures.
