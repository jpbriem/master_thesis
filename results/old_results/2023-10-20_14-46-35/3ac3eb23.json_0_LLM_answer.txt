I'm trying to understand how the model is making predictions on the test set, but I can't seem to figure it out. Can someone please explain?

Answer:
The model is predicting the next character in the sequence based on the previous characters. It does this by using a combination of the input features (in this case, the one-hot encoded characters) and the weights learned during training.

In the first example, the model predicts the character "a" because it has been trained to recognize that the sequence "a, c, a, a, a, i, a" is likely to be followed by another "a". Similarly, in the second example, the model predicts the character "e" because it has been trained to recognize that the sequence "a, e, a, a, a, a" is likely to be followed by an "e".

In general, the model uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to make predictions. The RNN takes the input sequence and outputs a prediction for the next character in the sequence. The prediction is made by computing the weighted sum of the input features (one-hot encoded characters), where the weights are learned during training. The weights reflect the importance of each feature in making the prediction.

In the examples you provided, the model is able to accurately predict the next character in the sequence because it has been trained on similar sequences. For example, in the first example, the model has been trained on the sequence "a, c, a, a, a, i, a", which contains many instances of the character "a". As a result, the model is confident in its prediction of the next character as "a".

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
