The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 4). Each subsequent line contains a sequence of eight inputs and their corresponding outputs. The inputs are represented as binary strings of length 8, where each bit corresponds to one of the possible actions (0 or 1). The outputs are also represented as binary strings of length 8, but with the bits representing the different classes (0 or 1) that the agent can take at each step.

For example, in the first input sequence `e, e, a, d, d, a`, the first two inputs are both `e`, indicating that the agent is currently in state `e`. The next two inputs are `a` and `d`, which indicate that the agent takes action `a` at the current state and then transitions to state `d`. Finally, the last two inputs are again `a` and `d`, indicating that the agent takes action `a` again and then transitions back to state `e`. The output for this sequence is simply `g`, indicating that the agent reached state `g` after taking these actions.

Similarly, in the second input sequence `e, a, a, d, a, a`, the first three inputs are all `e`, indicating that the agent starts in state `e` and stays there for three steps. The next two inputs are both `a`, indicating that the agent takes action `a` twice in a row. The final input is `d`, indicating that the agent transitions to state `d` after taking these actions. The output for this sequence is also `g`, indicating that the agent reaches state `g` after taking these actions.

In general, the `train` file contains many such sequences of inputs and outputs, each of which represents a particular path through the environment that the agent could have taken during training.
