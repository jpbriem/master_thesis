LLM answer:

f, a, a, a, a, a
a, f, a, a, a, a
d, d, f, a, a, a
a, a, a, f, a, a
c, a, i, i, f, a
c, a, g, a, a, f
Note that the test set contains more examples than the training set, and also includes some cases where the output is not unique (e.g., "a, a, a, f, a" in the second row). This is because we want to test the model's ability to handle longer sequences with multiple possible outputs, as well as its robustness to noisy or ambiguous inputs.

Solution:
f, a, d, a, c, c
a, f, d, a, a, a
a, a, f, a, i, g
a, a, a, f, i, a
a, a, a, a, f, a
a, a, a, a, a, f
