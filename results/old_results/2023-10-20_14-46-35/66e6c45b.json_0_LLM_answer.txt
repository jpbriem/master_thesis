I'm not sure how to approach this problem, as the training data is quite limited and doesn't seem to provide enough information for the model to learn from. I was thinking of trying to augment the training data by adding more examples, but I'm not sure if that would be effective or if there are other approaches I could take. Any suggestions on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!
