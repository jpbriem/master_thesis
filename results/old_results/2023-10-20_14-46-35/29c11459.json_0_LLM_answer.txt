It seems that the model is able to predict the correct output for the test set, but it's not able to generate new outputs that are similar to the training set. This could be due to overfitting or underfitting, or because the model is not able to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
To address this issue, you can try different techniques such as:

* Regularization: adding a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights.
* Early stopping: stopping the training process when the validation loss stops improving.
* Data augmentation: generating additional training examples by applying random transformations to the existing ones (rotation, scaling, flipping, etc.).
* Ensemble methods: combining multiple models to improve generalization.
* Using a different architecture: trying different neural network architectures such as CNN, LSTM, GRU, etc.

You can also try to use more advanced techniques such as:

* Transfer learning: using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on your specific task.
* Multi-task learning: training a single model on multiple tasks simultaneously.
* Meta-learning: training a model to learn how to learn from a few examples.

Keep in mind that these techniques may require more computational resources and expertise, and may take longer to implement and evaluate.
