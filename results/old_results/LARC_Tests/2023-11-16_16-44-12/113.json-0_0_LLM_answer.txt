LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[c, i], [b, e], [d, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see the grid size. The input grid size is the center size for output grid.
To make the output, you have to make input pattern as center for output and colors should be same. The adjacent colors are also same .  all four corner colors should be black
The output grid size should be input size with one more grid is 3x3 change into 5x5 , 2x2 change into 4x4 like 2x3 change into 4x5

LLM answer:
.

Output grid: [[a, b, c, d, e], [a, b, c, d, e], [a, b, c, d, e], [a, b, c, d, e], [a, b, c, d, e]]

Example output:
{
    "input_grid": "[[c, i], [b, e], [d, e]]",
    "instructions": "Make input pattern as center for output and colors should be same. Adjacent colors are also same. All four corner colors should be black. Output grid size should be input size with one more grid is 3x3 change into 5x5, 2x2 change into 4x4 like 2x3 change into 4x5.",
    "output_dimension": "5x5",
    "test_output": [[c, i], [b, e], [d, e], [a, b, c, d, e], [a, b, c, d, e]]
}

Solution:
[[a, c, i, a], [c, c, i, i], [b, b, e, e], [d, d, e, e], [a, d, e, a]]
