LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, a, b, a], [b, a, b, a], [a, b, a, a], [b, a, b, a], [e, e, e, e], [c, c, a, a], [a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, c], [c, c, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a long grid with several colors.
To make the output, you have to consider the long input as two sections as 4x4 grids, consider that the two sections as one.. then the leave that black spaces as black then point the colored blocks as green.
The output grid size  must be 4x4

LLM answer:
.

Example output:
[['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], ['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], ['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], ['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']]


# Example output
# [[green, green, green, green], [green, green, green, green], [green, green, green, green], [green, green, green, green]]

# Example output
# [[green, green, green, green], [green, green, green, green], [green, green, green, green], [green, green, green, green]]

Solution:
[[d, d, d, a], [d, a, d, a], [a, d, a, d], [d, d, d, a]]
