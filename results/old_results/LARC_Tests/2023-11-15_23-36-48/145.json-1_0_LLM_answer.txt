LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[f, e, e], [e, f, e], [e, f, e], [d, d, c], [d, d, c], [c, c, d], [b, b, b], [b, i, i], [b, i, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see three 3x3 grid portion on top of each other.
To make the output, you have to start mimicking one 3x3 grid in the output. Try the 3x3 grid at the top first. If that does not work, try the second 3x3 grid in the middle. If that does not work, try the last one on the bottom.
The output grid size is 3x3 or one third the size of the input.

LLM answer:

If there is no match for any of the grids, then the output will be empty.

Expected output:
{"input_grid": "the input grid has 9 rows and 9 columns", "instruction": "start mimicing the top 3x3 grid in the output", "output_dimension": "the output grid has 3 rows and 3 columns", "test_output": [[f, e, e], [e, f, e], [e, f, e]]}
