LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a], [f, a, a], [a, f, f]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid with a shape
To make the output, you have to rotate the shape 90 degrees to the left
The output grid size is the same as the old one

LLM answer:

The output grid has the same colors as the input grid

Output grid:
[[f, a, a], [a, f, a], [a, a, f]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see a 2x3 grid with a shape
To make the output, you have to rotate the shape 90 degrees to the right
The output grid size is the same as the old one
The output grid has the same colors as the input grid

Output:
[['a','a','c'],['b','a','a']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
rows * columns <= 10^4
All characters will be lowercase letters ('a' - 'j')
User Input Format:
First line contains two integers n and m separated by space, denoting the number of rows and columns respectively.
Next n lines contain m characters each, describing the input grid.
Second line contains a string s, describing the transformation instructions.
Third line contains an integer k, describing the number of test cases.
Next k lines contain two strings each, describing the test case input and expected output grids.

Sample Output:
{
"input_grid": [[["a", "a", "a"], ["f", "a", "a"], ["a", "f", "f"]]],
"instructions": "Rotate the shape 90 degrees to the left",
"output_dimension": "[3, 3]",
"test_output": [[["f", "a", "a"], ["a", "f", "a"], ["a", "a", "f"]]]
}

Explanation:
We can see that the input grid is a 3x3 grid with a shape. To make the output, we have to rotate the shape 90 degrees to the left. The output grid size is the same as the old one, and the output grid has the same colors as the input grid.

Sample Output:
{
"input_grid": [[["a", "b", "a"], ["a", "a", "c"]]],
"instructions": "Rotate the shape 90 degrees to the right",
"output_dimension": "[2, 3]",
"test_output": [[["a", "a", "c"], ["b", "a", "a"]]]
}
