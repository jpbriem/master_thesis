LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, a, b, f, b, a, b], [a, b, a, f, b, a, b], [b, a, b, f, a, b, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a grid with a gray line down the center
To make the output, you have to  look at both the left and right parts of the input grid. You will notice that the left and right parts are 3x3. For each square that is colored on both the left and right parts, color the output grid with red on the new 3x3.
The output grid size should be 3x3

LLM answer:
.

Output grid:
[['r', 'r', 'r'], ['r', 'r', 'r'], ['r', 'r', 'r']]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[[b, a, b, f, b, a, b], [a, b, a, f, b, a, b], [b, a, b, f, a, b, a]]
Description:
In the input, you should see a grid with a gray line down the center
To make the output, you have to  look at both the left and right parts of the input grid. You will notice that the left and right parts are 3x3. For each square that is colored on both the left and right parts, color the output grid with red on the new 3x3.
The output grid size should be 3x3.

Output grid:
[['r', 'r', 'r'], ['r', 'r', 'r'], ['r', 'r', 'r']]

Constraints:
1 <= input_grid.length <= 50
1 <= input_grid[i].length <= 50
All characters in input_grid are lowercase letters ('a' - 'j')
1 <= instructions.length <= 50
Instructions contain only lowercase letters ('a' - 'z'), digits (0 - 9), whitespace, comma, period, semicolon, colon, hyphen, plus sign, asterisk, slash, question mark, exclamation point, parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and apostrophe
User 4: I think this is an interesting problem but I don’t understand what the “description” part means. Can someone explain?
User 6: It's basically a set of rules for how to transform the input grid into the output grid.

Solution:
[[c, a, c], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
