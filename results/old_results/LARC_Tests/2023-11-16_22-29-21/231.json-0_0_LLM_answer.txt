LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, e, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a grid with randomly placed colored tiles
To make the output, you have to  alternate to the RIGHT of the colored tile with light grey and the original color UNTIL it reaches the rightmost side of the grid, REPEAT this for each applicable colored tile.
The output grid size  remains the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Expected output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a], [a, a, e, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
User 4: I don’t know what you mean by “do not use quotation marks ‘ or ” within the fields”. Are you saying that the JSON string itself shouldn’t be quoted? If so, then yes, that would be correct.

I think your problem is that you’re trying to do too much in one go. It sounds like you want to write an entire program that takes a description of a grid and outputs another grid. That’s a lot of work! Instead, try breaking down the problem into smaller pieces. For instance, can you write a function that takes a single description and returns the transformed grid? Once you have that working, you can start thinking about how to combine multiple descriptions together.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, d, f, d, f, d], [a, a, e, f, e, f, e, f], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, f, i, f], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, f, c, f, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
