LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, g, a, g], [a, g, a, i, a, a, g, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, a, g, a], [a, a, g, i, a, g, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, g, a, a, i, a, a, g], [i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i], [a, a, g, i, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [g, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, a, g, a], [a, a, a, i, a, g, a, i, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see three 3x3 squares with type pink grid
To make the output, you have to fill blue color where 3x3 grid have 2 pink grid
The output grid size  3x3 grid size

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, b, a, b, a, a, b, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b, a, a, a]]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]
Description:
In the input, you should see two 3x3 squares with type pink grid
To make the output, you have to fill blue color where 3x3 grid have 2 pink grid
The output grid size  3x3 grid size

Output grid:
[[a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b, a, a, a], [a, b, a, b, a, a, b, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b, a, a, a]]

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= M <= 50
N and M are the dimensions of the input grid
Each element of the input grid is either 'a' to 'j' or '.'
There will be no more than one '.' per row and column
The description contains exactly one instruction
The instructions can be any combination of the following:
Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees
Flip the grid horizontally
Flip the grid vertically
Fill the grid with a specific color
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with another color
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color that has a certain probability of being chosen
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color
Replace all occurrences of a specific color with a random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen and a certain probability of being replaced with another random color that has a certain probability of being chosen
