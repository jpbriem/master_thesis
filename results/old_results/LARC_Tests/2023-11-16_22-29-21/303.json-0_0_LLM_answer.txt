LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, b, h], [h, e, b], [f, b, h]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid with all colored boxes.
To make the output, you have to Notice that you can copy the original 3x3 grid 9 times into the new grid (nine 3x3 patterns) and fill out the new grid in this pattern. Now look at which color is the most common in the input grid and keep that in mind. For example, if blue is the most common color in the input box and the top, left box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 box into the top, left 3x3 area in the new grid. If the bottom, middle box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 grid into the middle top of the new grid. Alternatively, suppose the top right box is red (or any other color that is not the most common) in the input grid then that top right 3x3 area should be black in the new grid. Keep following that pattern until you're done. The black holes should now correlate to the locations of the colors of the boxes (in the input grid) that were not the most common.
The output grid size needs to be 9x9.
