LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, a, i], [a, a, a], [a, h, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a pattern with different colored squares
To make the output, you have to wherever you see a color other than black make squares below that color the same color down to the border
The output grid size is the same

LLM answer:
 as the input grid size

Output grid:
[[e, e, e], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see a pattern with different colored squares
To make the output, you have to wherever you see a color other than black make squares below that color the same color down to the border
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

Output:
[['a','a','a'],['a','a','a']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
rows * columns <= 10^4
User Input Format:
First line contains the number of rows and columns in the input grid
Second line contains the input grid
Third line contains the description

Sample Output:
{
    "input_grid": [[e, a, i], [a, a, a], [a, h, a]],
    "instructions": "In the input, you should see a pattern with different colored squares\nTo make the output, you have to wherever you see a color other than black make squares below that color the same color down to the border\nThe output grid size is the same as the input grid size",
    "output_dimension": "[3, 3]",
    "test_output": [[e, e, e], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
}

Explanation:
The input grid has three rows and three columns. It contains the characters 'e', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'h', 'a'. The description instructs us to look for patterns in the input grid and make changes accordingly. In this case, we need to change all the squares below any square that is not black to the same color as the original square. Since there are no black squares in the input grid, we need to change all the squares to the same color. Therefore, the output grid will be [[e, e, e], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]].

Solution:
[[e, a, i], [e, a, i], [e, h, i]]
