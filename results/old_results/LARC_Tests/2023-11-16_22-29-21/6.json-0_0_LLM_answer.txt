LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, b, a, a, a, a, c], [b, a, a, a, a, c, a], [a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a], [a, a, c, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, e], [c, a, a, a, a, e, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 7 by 7 grid being different colored on black background
To make the output, you have to fill the black grid with same pattern of row color, next row need to replace the same pattern of first row one column move shifted left
The output grid size should be same as input size

LLM answer:


Example output:
{
    "input_grid": [[a, b, a, a, a, a, c], [b, a, a, a, a, c, a], [a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a], [a, a, c, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, e], [c, a, a, a, a, e, a]],
    "instructions": ["Fill the black grid with same pattern of row color", "Next row need to replace the same pattern of first row one column move shifted left"],
    "output_dimension": [7, 7],
    "test_output": [[a, b, a, a, a, a, c], [b, a, a, a, a, c, a], [a, a, a, a, c, a, a], [a, a, a, c, a, a, a], [a, a, c, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, e], [c, a, a, a, a, e, a]]
}

Note that the instructions field can contain multiple steps separated by commas. Each step should describe an action to perform on the current state of the grid. For example, "Replace all blue squares with red" would mean replacing every square with value 'b' with value 'r'.

If there are any errors in your solution, please provide a detailed explanation of what went wrong. If you believe your solution is correct but still received an error message, please include a screenshot of the error message along with your code.

Good luck!
