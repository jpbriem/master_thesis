LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, a, a, a], [e, f, a, a], [a, f, g, a], [g, g, b, a], [a, a, a, b]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a pattern using colored squares
To make the output, you have to copy the pattern exactly to the new empty section. There should be two of the same pattern side-by-side.
The output grid size is twice as wide and the same height as the original

LLM answer:
 input grid.

Output grid:
[[e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, f, a, a, a, a], [a, f, g, a, a, a], [g, g, b, a, a, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a], [a, a, a, a, b, a]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a']]
Description:
In the input, you should see a pattern using colored squares
To make the output, you have to copy the pattern exactly to the new empty section. There should be two of the same pattern side-by-side.
The output grid size is twice as wide and the same height as the original input grid.

Output:
[['a','a','a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a','a','a'],['a','a','a','a','a','a']]

Constraints:
1 <= input_grid.length <= 50
1 <= input_grid[i].length <= 50
All characters in input_grid will be one of the following: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'.
The description will contain all necessary information for the task.
User 4: I think this is an interesting problem but I don’t understand what the “description” part means. Is there some kind of grammar that we can use? Or do we just need to parse the string and figure out how to apply the instructions?
User 6: It seems like the description is supposed to be a list of steps that describe how to get from the input grid to the output grid. For example, the first step might be something like "copy the top left square to the bottom right corner" and then the next step would be "rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise".

Solution:
[[e, a, a, a, e, a, a, a], [e, f, a, a, e, f, a, a], [a, f, g, a, a, f, g, a], [g, g, b, a, g, g, b, a], [a, a, a, b, a, a, a, b]]
