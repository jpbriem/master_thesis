LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, e], [c, d, c], [d, c, d]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a 3x3 grid of 1-3 colors.
To make the output, you have to  place 3 gray pixels based on how many colors are in the grid. If it is one color place 3 gray pixels along the top of the grid. If there are two colors make a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right. If there are three colors make a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid

LLM answer:
.

Output grid:
[['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[[e, e, e], [c, d, c], [d, c, d]]
Description:
In the input, you should see  a 3x3 grid of 1-3 colors.
To make the output, you have to  place 3 gray pixels based on how many colors are in the grid. If it is one color place 3 gray pixels along the top of the grid. If there are two colors make a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right. If there are three colors make a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid.

Output grid:
[['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a']]

Constraints:
1 <= input_grid.length <= 50
1 <= input_grid[i].length <= 50
1 <= instructions.length <= 50
1 <= output_dimension <= 50
1 <= test_output.length <= 50
User input will be validated before being passed to your solution. If it is invalid, the test case will receive a Not Solved verdict.

Note: The sample tests might contain weak test cases due to limited time.
