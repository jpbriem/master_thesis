LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, c, c, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a square made up of red boxes along with some gray boxes spread apart.
To make the output, you have to simply move the gray boxes toward the red boxes taking the most direct route possible. The gray boxes are then placed wherever they touch a red box in some way.
The output grid size stays the same size.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, c, c, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it now
User 5: It's a puzzle game called "Sokoban" that was popular back in the day. There are many variants, including one where you can push multiple blocks at once.
