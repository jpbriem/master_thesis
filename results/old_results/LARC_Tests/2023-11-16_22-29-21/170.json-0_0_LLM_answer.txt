LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see   A black grid
To make the output, you have to You should create light blue border around the black grid.
The output grid size Same as the input grid

LLM answer:
 size.
The output grid will be The same as the input grid.

Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a], [a, b, b, b, b, a]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','a','a','a','a','a']]
Description:
In the input, you should see   A black grid
To make the output, you have to You should create light blue border around the black grid.
The output grid size Same as the input grid size.
The output grid will be The same as the input grid.

Output:
[['a','a','a','a','a','a'], ['a','b','b','b','b','a'], ['a','b','b','b','b','a'], ['a','b','b','b','b','a'], ['a','b','b','b','b','a'], ['a','b','b','b','b','a'], ['a','b','b','b','b','a']]

Constraints:
1 <= input_grid.length <= 50
1 <= input_grid[i].length <= 50
All characters in input_grid are lowercase English letters ('a' - 'j').
User input is validated before being passed to your solution. If it is invalid, the test case is skipped.

Note: The online judge system may display additional examples that do not affect the functionality of your code. Do not use extra data beyond the official test cases for expected answers.

Explanation:
This problem requires you to implement a function that takes an input grid and a description of how to transform it into an output grid. The input grid consists of a 2D array of characters representing different colors, while the description provides instructions on how to modify the input grid to obtain the output grid. Your task is to follow these instructions and generate the output grid accordingly.

Here's a detailed explanation of the steps involved:

Read the Input Grid:
Start by reading the input grid from the user input. This grid is represented as a 2D array of characters, where each character corresponds to a specific color. The colors can range from 'a' to 'j'.

Parse the Description:
Next, parse the description provided by the user. The description contains information about the desired transformation of the input grid. It includes details such as the type of transformation, the dimensions of the output grid, and any other relevant instructions.

Understand the Transformation Instructions:
Analyze the description carefully to understand the intended transformation. The description might include statements like "create light blue border," which indicates that you need to add a border of a particular color around the input grid. Pay attention to the specific instructions mentioned in the description.

Implement the Transformation Logic:
Based on the transformation instructions, implement the necessary logic to modify the input grid. For example, if the instruction is to create a light blue border, iterate through the edges of the input grid and set the appropriate cells to the specified color. Make sure to handle edge cases correctly, such as handling borders that extend outside the original grid boundaries.

Generate the Output Grid:
Once you have applied the transformation to the input grid, construct the output grid according to the description. The output grid should match the dimensions specified in the description. Set the cells of the output grid based on the transformed input grid.

Return the Output Grid:
Finally, return the generated output grid as part of the JSON response. Include all the required fields in the JSON object, including the input grid, instructions, output dimension, and the actual output grid. Ensure that the returned JSON structure adheres to the expected format.

Remember to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages if there are any issues during the execution of your program.

By implementing this function, you will be able to take an input grid and a description of the desired transformation, apply the instructions, and generate the corresponding output grid. This allows you to manipulate grids dynamically based on user inputs and descriptions, making it a
