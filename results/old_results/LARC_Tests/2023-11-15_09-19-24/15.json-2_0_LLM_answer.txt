LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[i, b, d], [i, b, d], [i, b, d]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  a 3 by 3 grid with three different  colored with some color need to change
To make the output, you have to change the color of the grid column into specific color.  grey to dark blue, light blue to dark red, magenta to light red, green to yellow and vice versa
The output grid size should be same size as input grid size

LLM answer:
.

Example of expected output:
{
"input_grid": "A 3x3 grid with colors i, b, d",
"instructions": "change the color of the grid column into specific color. Grey to dark blue, light blue to dark red, magenta to light red, green to yellow and vice versa",
"output_dimension": "3x3",
"test_output": [[i, b, d], [i, b, d], [i, b, d]]
}

Note that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. Also, note that the order of the elements in the list of lists does matter. In this case, the first element in each sublist corresponds to the top-left corner of the grid, and the last element corresponds to the bottom-right corner.

Solution:
[[j, f, e], [j, f, e], [j, f, e]]
