LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, f, a, f, b, a, a, f, a, f, i], [c, c, a, a, b, a, f, d, a, a, i], [a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see three shapes, all of which have a main color with some grey boxes.
To make the output, you have to make any grey boxes the same color as the blocks to which it is connected. Remove columns of black boxes. Align the middle and right shapes so that the former grey squares are connected.
The output grid size changes in length by removed any black columns that separate the shapes

LLM answer:
. It keeps the original height.

Example of what the output should look like: [[a, f, a, f, b, a, a, f, a, f, i], [c, c, a, a, b, a, f, d, a, a, i], [a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

Input grid:
[['a', 'f', 'a', 'f', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'f', 'i'], ['c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'f', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Output grid:
[['a', 'f', 'a', 'f', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'f', 'i'], ['c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'f', 'd', 'a', 'a', 'i'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Expected output:
{
"input_grid": "Describes the input grid",
"instructions": "Describes the transformation actions step by step",
"output_dimension": "Describes the output grid dimension",
"test_output": "Transformed output grid"
}
\end{code}

I am having trouble understanding how to implement this task. Can someone please provide me with an outline of the steps I need to take to complete this task?

Answer: Sure! Here's an outline of the steps you can follow to complete this task:

1. Read the input grid and description carefully: Before starting the implementation, make sure you understand the input grid and the description of the task. The input grid is a 2D array of characters, where each character represents a color. The description provides information about the shape of the input grid and the transformations that need to be applied to it.
2. Preprocess the input grid: Based on the description, identify the shapes in the input grid and their respective colors. You may need to iterate over the rows and columns of the grid to identify the shapes.
3. Apply transformations to the input grid: According to the description, you need to make any grey boxes the same color as the blocks to which they are connected. To do this, you can iterate over the rows and columns of the grid again, and for each grey box, find the adjacent boxes that are connected to it and have a color. Then, change the color of the grey box to match the color of the adjacent boxes.
4. Remove columns of black boxes: After applying the transformations, remove any columns that contain only black boxes. This will help align the middle and right shapes.
5. Align the middle and right shapes: Once the unnecessary columns are removed, align the middle and right shapes so that the former grey squares are connected. This might involve shifting the rows or columns of the grid.
6. Determine the output grid size: Based on the description, the output grid size should be the same as the input grid size, but without any black columns that separate the shapes.
7. Create the output grid: Use the preprocessed input grid and the transformed shapes to create the output grid. Make sure to fill in the correct colors for each cell in the grid.
8. Test the output grid: Finally, test the output grid to ensure that it matches the expected output described in the task.
9. Format the output as JSON: Once the output grid is ready, format it as JSON, along with the necessary metadata, such as the input grid, instructions, output dimension, and test output.

By following these steps, you should be able to complete the task successfully. Good luck!
