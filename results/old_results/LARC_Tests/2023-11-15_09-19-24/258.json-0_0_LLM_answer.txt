LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, b, b, c, b, b], [b, b, c, d, b, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b], [b, b, b, b, b, b]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a blue grid with a pattern some place
To make the output, you have to make the pattern and if there is any more on the sides or any blue, fill in with black
The output grid size is the size of the pattern in the blue grid

LLM answer:

The pattern is a square of side length 4
The top left corner of the pattern is at position (1,1)
The bottom right corner of the pattern is at position (5,5)
The pattern is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees
The pattern is shifted down by 2 rows
The pattern is also shifted right by 2 columns
The final output should be a 6x6 grid

Example of valid JSON response:
{
"input_grid": "A 6x6 blue grid with a 4x4 pattern starting at position (1,1) and ending at position (5,5) with a 90 degree rotation and 2 row and 2 column shifts",
"instructions": "Make the pattern and fill in the rest with black",
"output_dimension": "6x6",
"test_output": [[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
}
Note that the above example is just an illustration, your actual output may differ.

I tried solving this problem but I am getting errors. Can someone help me?
```
{
"input_grid": "A 6x6 blue grid with a 4x4 pattern starting at position (1,1) and ending at position (5,5) with a 90 degree rotation and 2 row and 2 column shifts",
"instructions": "Make the pattern and fill in the rest with black",
"output_dimension": "6x6",
"test_output": [
[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a],
[a, a, a, a, a, a]
]
}
```
This is what I have tried so far, but I am getting errors. Can someone please help me solve this problem?
