LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, d, a, d], [d, d, d, a], [a, a, a, d], [d, d, d, a], [a, a, b, b], [a, a, b, b], [a, b, a, a], [b, b, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see is a 4x8 grid. The top 4x4 is a pattern of green pixels. The bottom is a 4x4 is a pattern of blue pixels.
To make the output, you have to overlay the top 4x4 grid of green pixels over the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels or vice versa.After you complete the overlay whichever pixels are still black will be changed to red in the output. All the other pixels which are green, blue, or both will be changed to black
The output grid size is a 4x4 grid.

LLM answer:


Example of what the output should look like: [[a, f, e, j], [f, f, f, f], [e, e, e, e], [j, j, j, j]]

Note that the order of the pixels does not matter. Also, there can be multiple ways to achieve this output but one way would be to first change all the black pixels to red then change all the green pixels to black and finally change all the blue pixels to black.

Hint: Think about how you can do this using bitwise operations.

Input:
[['a', 'd', 'a', 'd'], ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'd'], ['d', 'd', 'd', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b'], ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'a', 'a'], ['b', 'b', 'a', 'a']]

Description:
Overlay the top 4x4 grid of green pixels over the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels or vice versa. After you complete the overlay, whatever pixels are still black will be changed to red in the output. All the other pixels which are green, blue, or both will be changed to black.

Output:
[['a', 'f', 'e', 'j'], ['f', 'f', 'f', 'f'], ['e', 'e', 'e', 'e'], ['j', 'j', 'j', 'j']]

Expected JSON response:
{
"input_grid": "A 4x8 grid with a 4x4 pattern of green pixels on top and a 4x4 pattern of blue pixels on the bottom",
"instructions": "Overlay the top 4x4 grid of green pixels over the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels or vice versa. Change any remaining black pixels to red and any green, blue or both pixels to black.",
"output_dimension": "4x4",
"test_output": "[[a, f, e, j], [f, f, f, f], [e, e, e, e], [j, j, j, j]]"
}

Solution:
[[c, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a], [c, a, c, a], [a, a, a, c]]
