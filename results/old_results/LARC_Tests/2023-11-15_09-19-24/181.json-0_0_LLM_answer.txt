LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see shapes surrounded by a complete gray border
To make the output, you have to change the color of the shape or shapes that match the shape inside the complete gray border so that they are the same color. That is the color of the shape that is identical in size to the one in the gray, will change to the same color as the one in the gray.
The output grid size stays the same

LLM answer:
.
If there is no shape inside the gray border, then leave the cell unchanged.
If there is more than one shape of the same size, then all cells of those shapes must be changed to the same color.
If there is a shape partially covered by another shape, then only the part of the shape that is completely covered by the other shape should be changed.
If there is a shape that is partially outside the border, then only the part of the shape that is inside the border should be changed.
If there is a shape that is completely outside the border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that has some parts covered by another shape but also has some parts that are not covered, then only the parts that are not covered should be changed.
If there is a shape that is completely covered by another shape, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that is the same size as the gray border, then change the color of the entire shape to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that is larger than the gray border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that is smaller than the gray border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with multiple shapes of the same size, then change the color of all the shapes that overlap with the shape to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with multiple shapes of different sizes, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that does not overlap with any other shape, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is the same size as the gray border, then change the color of the shape that overlaps to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is larger than the gray border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is smaller than the gray border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is partially covered by another shape, then change the color of the part of the shape that overlaps with the other shape to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is completely covered by another shape, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is partially outside the border, then change the color of the part of the shape that overlaps with the border to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is completely outside the border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that has some parts covered by another shape but also has some parts that are not covered, then change the color of the parts that are not covered to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is completely covered by another shape, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is the same size as the gray border, then change the color of the shape that overlaps to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is larger than the gray border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is smaller than the gray border, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that overlaps with another shape, then change the color of the part of the shape that overlaps with the other shape to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that does not overlap with any other shape, then do nothing for that shape.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is partially covered by another shape and also has some parts that are not covered, then change the color of the parts that are not covered to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is completely covered by another shape and also has some parts that are not covered, then change the color of the parts that are not covered to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is partially outside the border and also has some parts that are not covered, then change the color of the parts that are not covered to the same color as the gray border.
If there is a shape that overlaps with a shape that is completely outside the border and also has some parts that are not covered, then do nothing for that shape.
