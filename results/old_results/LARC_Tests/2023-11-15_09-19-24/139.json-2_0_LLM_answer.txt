LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[g, d, f], [g, i, a], [e, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a small black grid with a multicolored shape in it.
To make the output, you have to imagine that the entire grid has been flipped both horizontally and vertically. Once you picture that you can create the output grid.
The output grid size is the same as the input.

LLM answer:


Example of valid JSON response:
{
"input_grid": "A 3x3 grid with colors g, d, f, g, i, a, e, a, a",
"instructions": "Flip the grid both horizontally and vertically",
"output_dimension": "3x3",
"test_output": [[a, i, e], [d, f, g], [g, a, a]]
}
Note: The above example is just an illustration. Your task is to generate the correct JSON response based on the given input and description.

Solution:
[[a, a, e], [a, i, g], [f, d, g]]
