LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, c, c, c, c, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see horizontal bar of orange squares, either 2, 3, or 4 squares.
To make the output, you have to place the horizontal bar in the exact position in the output. Then add 1 to the number of orange squares and fill in that number of squares directly above the orange bar, but in GREEN, beginning with the leftmost square. Then add another 1, and fill in that number of squares in another green horizontal bar right above. Continue doing that all the way to the top. Then subtract the number of the original orange squares by 1, then draw under the orange bar the new number of squares in BLUE, also beginning with the leftmost square. Repeat until the number of blue squares is 1. Draw that, then you are done.
The output grid size is the same.

LLM answer:


Example:
Input: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, c, c, c, c, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Output: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, c, c, c, c, a, a, a, a], [a, g, g, g, a, a, a, a, a], [a, g, g, g, a, a, a, a, a], [a, g, g, g, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a]]
Explanation:
The input has three rows of orange squares. In the first row, there are two orange squares, so we add one to get three and fill in three green squares above it. We then add one more to get four and fill in four blue squares above the second orange square. Since there are three orange squares in the second row, we repeat the process, filling in three green and three blue squares respectively. Finally, since there is only one orange square in the third row, we fill in one green square and one blue square above it. The result is the output grid.

Solution:
[[d, d, d, d, d, d, d, a, a], [d, d, d, d, d, d, a, a, a], [c, c, c, c, c, a, a, a, a], [b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a], [b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
