LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, g, a, g], [a, g, a, i, a, a, g, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i], [a, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, a, g, a], [a, a, g, i, a, g, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, g, a, a, i, a, a, g], [i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i, i], [a, a, g, i, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [g, a, a, i, a, a, a, i, a, g, a], [a, a, a, i, a, g, a, i, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see A 3 high and 3 wide square with 9 square sections, each with pink squares
To make the output, you have to For each section that hold 2 pink squares, represent that area with a blue box on the new grid. Single squares are shown as black.
The output grid size Reduce the grid size so that one square is available for each group. Each 3 by 3 should need a single square.

LLM answer:


Example of what the output would look like:
[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i']]

Here, we have a 3x3 grid with 9 squares. Each square has a letter representing a color. We want to replace each group of 2 or more adjacent squares of the same color with a single blue box. If there is only one square of a certain color, we leave it as is (black). The resulting grid will be smaller since we are replacing groups of squares with a single blue box.

Input Grid:

a b c
d e f
g h i

Output Grid:

a b c
d e f
g h i

Explanation:
We start with a 3x3 grid with letters representing colors. We can see that there are 3 groups of 2 or more adjacent squares of the same color:

* Top left: 2 pink squares (a and b)
* Middle: 2 yellow squares (e and f)
* Bottom right: 2 green squares (h and i)

We replace each group with a single blue box, leaving the remaining squares unchanged (a, d, g). The resulting grid is 3x3, with each square representing a unique color.

Note: The order of the blue boxes doesn't matter, as long as they correspond to the groups of 2 or more adjacent squares of the same color."
