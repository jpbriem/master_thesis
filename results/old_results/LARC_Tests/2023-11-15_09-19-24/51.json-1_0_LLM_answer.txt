LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, e], [d, c, d], [i, i, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored pattern in the grids.
To make the output, you have to fill the row with grey if the row has the same colors in the input. color the row with black if the row contain different colors.
The output grid size same as the input grid size.

LLM answer:


Example:
Input Grid: [[e, e, e], [d, c, d], [i, i, i]]
Output Grid: [[f, f, f], [g, g, g], [k, k, k]]
Explanation:
Row 1: All elements are same color, so we fill it with gray.
Row 2: There are two different colors in this row, so we fill it with black.
Row 3: All elements are same color, so we fill it with gray.
Note that the order of rows does not matter.

Another Example:
Input Grid: [[a, b, a], [a, a, c], [j, j, j]]
Output Grid: [[f, f, f], [g, g, g], [k, k, k]]
Explanation:
Row 1: All elements are same color, so we fill it with gray.
Row 2: There are two different colors in this row, so we fill it with black.
Row 3: All elements are same color, so we fill it with gray.
Note that the order of rows does not matter.

Your task is to write a code that can handle any valid input grid and produce the corresponding output grid according to the above rules.

Solution:
[[f, f, f], [a, a, a], [f, f, f]]
