LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, j, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, j, f, a, a], [e, a, a, a, a, a, a, j, a, a, a], [a, f, e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, c, c, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see several color patterns that each contain a single gray square.
To make the output, you have to move each pattern so that the gray square in each pattern occupies the center square of the output 3x3 grid.
The output grid size is 3x3.

LLM answer:

Each pattern can be moved in one of four ways: up, down, left, right.
If there are multiple patterns that can be moved in the same way, choose the top-left most such pattern.
If no pattern can be moved in any of those ways, then leave the output empty.

Example:
Input: [[a, b, a], [a, a, c], [d, e, f]]
Output: [[a, d, a], [a, e, a], [a, f, a]]
Explanation:
The first pattern is [a, b, a]. It has a gray square at position (1,1). We move it up and to the right, so it becomes [a, d, a] in the output.
The second pattern is [a, a, c]. It has a gray square at position (1,1). We move it down and to the right, so it becomes [a, e, a] in the output.
The third pattern is [d, e, f]. It has a gray square at position (1,1). We move it up and to the left, so it becomes [a, f, a] in the output.
Note that we chose the top-left most pattern for each movement direction.

Another Example:
Input: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Output: [[a, a, a], [a, a, a], [a, a, a]]
Explanation:
There are no patterns with a gray square in this input. Therefore, the output is just three copies of the background color [a].
