LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each element in the output grid is equal to the number of adjacent elements in the input grid that are equal to the corresponding element in the output grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a 3x3 grid with the given values:

| 0 | 0 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 3 | 0 |
| 0 | 3 | 0 |

The output for this input would be:

| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

Note that this pattern only works for the specific cases provided in the training data. It may not generalize well to other inputs.
