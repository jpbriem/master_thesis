LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is being transformed into a single number, with the following rules:

1. If there are no zeros in the row, the output is the highest non-zero value in the row.
2. If there is exactly one zero in the row, the output is the next highest non-zero value after the zero.
3. If there are two or more zeros in the row, the output is the highest non-zero value in the row, unless there is a sequence of consecutive zeros at the end of the row, in which case the output is the last non-zero value before the sequence of zeros.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to get the test output:
