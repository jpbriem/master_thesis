LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is being transformed into a single number, with certain positions in the row being selected for inclusion in the output based on their value. Specifically, it seems that the following rules are being applied:

* If there are three consecutive identical values in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the middle value is selected for inclusion in the output.
* If there are two consecutive identical values in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the second value is selected for inclusion in the output.
* If there is only one value in a row that is not part of a sequence of identical values, then that value is selected for inclusion in the output.

Using these rules, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to create a complete grid:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the above rules to this completed grid, we get the following output:

1, 6, 2
6, 1, 1
2, 6, 1
