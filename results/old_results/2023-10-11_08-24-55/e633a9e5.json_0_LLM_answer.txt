[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, with some elements possibly being modified in the process. Specifically:

* The first element of each row is repeated twice.
* The second element of each row is repeated three times.
* The third element of each row is repeated four times.
* The fourth element of each row is repeated five times.
* The fifth element of each row (if present) is repeated six times.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

test input: 1, 2, 5
1. 1, 2, 5 (original input)
2. 1, 2, 5 (repeated once)
3. 1, 2, 5 (repeated twice)
4. 1, 2, 5 (repeated three times)
5. 1, 2, 5 (repeated four times)

test output: 1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5

Next, let's apply the same pattern to the remaining inputs:

test input: 7, 3, 6
7. 7, 3, 6 (original input)
1. 7, 3, 6 (repeated once)
2. 7, 3, 6 (repeated twice)
3. 7, 3, 6 (repeated three times)
4. 7, 3, 6 (repeated four times)
5. 7, 3, 6 (repeated five times)

test output: 7, 7, 7, 3, 6, 6, 6

Finally, applying the same pattern to the last input:

test input: 7, 6, 5
7. 7, 6, 5 (original input)
1. 7, 6, 5 (repeated once)
2. 7, 6, 5 (repeated twice)
3. 7, 6, 5 (repeated three times)
4. 7, 6, 5 (repeated four times)
5. 7, 6, 5 (repeated five times)

test output: 7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 5
7, 7, 7, 3, 6, 6, 6
7, 7, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5
