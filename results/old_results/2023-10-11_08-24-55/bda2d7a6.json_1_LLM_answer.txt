LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in the input grid to corresponding values in the output grid, based on their positions in the grid. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input grid is replaced by a different value in the output grid, according to the following rules:

* If the value in the input grid is 0, it remains unchanged in the output grid.
* If the value in the input grid is 1-7, it becomes the corresponding value (1-7) in the output grid.
* If the value in the input grid is 8, it becomes 5 in the output grid.

Using these rules, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to create a complete grid:

test input:
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3
3, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 3
3, 7, 6, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3
3, 7, 6, 3, 3, 6, 7, 3
3, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 3
3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3

Applying the above rules to this completed grid, we get the following test output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0
0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0
0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0
0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0
0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0
0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
