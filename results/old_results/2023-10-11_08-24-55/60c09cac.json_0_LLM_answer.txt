LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
0, 3, 0
0, 7, 7
0, 0, 0
train output:
0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7
0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
train input:
0, 0, 8, 0
0, 8, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 5
0, 0, 0, 0
train output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
test input:
0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 0

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some modifications. Specifically:

* Each element of the input is either copied directly to the output (e.g., 0 -> 0), replaced by a copy of an adjacent element (e.g., 3 -> 3, 7 -> 7), or replaced by a copy of itself shifted by one position (e.g., 0 -> 0, 8 -> 8).
* There are no gaps or empty spaces in the output.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing elements of the test input to create a complete 2D grid:

| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The resulting test output would be:

| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Note that this solution assumes that the pattern observed in the training data holds for all possible inputs. If there are other rules or constraints at play, they do not appear to be captured by the provided examples.
