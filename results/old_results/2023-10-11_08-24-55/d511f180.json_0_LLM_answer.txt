LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input row is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output row, based on their positions.

Here's the step-by-step pattern:

1. Take the first digit of the input row and replace it with the first digit of the corresponding output row.
2. Take the second digit of the input row and replace it with the second digit of the corresponding output row.
3. Continue this process for each digit in the input row, until all digits have been replaced.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test input: 8, 8, 4, 5
3, 8, 7, 5
3, 7, 1, 9
6, 4, 8, 8

test output: 8, 8, 5, 5
3, 8, 7, 8
3, 7, 1, 9
6, 8, 4, 8
