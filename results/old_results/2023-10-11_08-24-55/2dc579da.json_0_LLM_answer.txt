LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be that the output is always a repeating sequence of the same number, with the number of repeats being equal to the number of times the same number appears in the input row.

For example, in the first train input and output pair, the input row has two 8s and three 3s, so the output row has two 8s followed by three 3s. In the second train input and output pair, the input row has four 4s and two 2s, so the output row has four 4s followed by two 2s.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we can see that the first row has six 1s and five 0s, so the output for that row would be six 1s followed by five 0s, which is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

The second row of the test input has four 1s and four 0s, so the output for that row would be four 1s followed by four 0s, which is 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

The third row of the test input has three 1s and three 0s, so the output for that row would be three 1s followed by three 0s, which is 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

The fourth row of the test input has two 1s and two 0s, so the output for that row would be two 1s followed by two 0s, which is 1, 1, 0, 0.

The fifth row of the test input has one 1 and one 0, so the output for that row would be one 1 followed by one 0, which is 1, 0.

The sixth row of the test input has one 1 and five 0s, so the output for that row would be one 1 followed by five 0s, which is 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

The seventh row of the test input has five 1s and one 0, so the output for that row would be five 1s followed by one 0, which is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

The eighth row of the test input has four 1s and two 0s, so the output for that row would be four 1s followed by two 0s, which is 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0.

The ninth row of the test input has three 1s and two 0s, so the output for that row would be three 1s followed by two 0s, which is 1, 1, 1, 0, 0.

The tenth row of the test input has two 1s and one 0, so the output for that row would be two 1s followed by one 0, which is 1, 1, 0.

Therefore, the test output would be:

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
