LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple mapping of the input values to the output values. Each row of the input is mapped to a corresponding row of the output.

The first train input has three rows:

* Row 1: 4, 4, 6
* Row 2: 3, 3, 3
* Row 3: 6, 6, 4

The corresponding train output has three rows:

* Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 3: 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6

The second train input has three rows:

* Row 1: 2, 4, 3
* Row 2: 2, 3, 4
* Row 3: 2, 3, 4

The corresponding train output has three rows:

* Row 1: 2, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 2: 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 3: 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The third train input has three rows:

* Row 1: 1, 1, 1
* Row 2: 6, 2, 2
* Row 3: 2, 2, 6

The corresponding train output has three rows:

* Row 1: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
* Row 2: 6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2
* Row 3: 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6

The fourth train input has three rows:

* Row 1: 3, 1, 6
* Row 2: 3, 6, 1
* Row 3: 3, 1, 6

The corresponding train output has three rows:

* Row 1: 3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 2: 3, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 3: 3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that the test output for the test input <code>6, 6, 3
4, 4, 3
4, 4, 3</code> would be:

* Row 1: 6, 6, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 2: 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Row 3: 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

<code>6, 6, 3, 4, 4, 3</code>.
