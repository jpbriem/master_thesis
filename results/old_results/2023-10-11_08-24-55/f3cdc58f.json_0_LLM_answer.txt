LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shifted grid relative to the original grid.

The modifications appear to be as follows:

* If the shifted grid overlaps with the original grid, the values in the overlap region are modified by adding a fixed value (which may be different for different transformations) to their current value.
* If the shifted grid does not overlap with the original grid, no modification is made to the values in the grid.

It's worth noting that there are eight possible directions in which the grid can be shifted (up, down, left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, and down-right), and each transformation only applies to one of these directions. Additionally, each transformation seems to have a unique "weight" associated with it, which determines the amount by which the values in the overlap region are modified.

Given this information, we can now apply the pattern to the test input grid to obtain the test output grid. Here's how the transformations would be applied, in order:

1. Shift the grid up by 3 positions, add 1 to the values in the overlap region.
2. Shift the grid left by 2 positions, add 2 to the values in the overlap region.
3. Shift the grid up by 2 positions, add 3 to the values in the overlap region.
4. Shift the grid right by 1 position, add 4 to the values in the overlap region.
5. Shift the grid down by 1 position, add 0 to the values in the overlap region.
6. Shift the grid left by 1 position, add 1 to the values in the overlap region.
7. Shift the grid down by 2 positions, add 2 to the values in the overlap region.
8. Shift the grid right by 2 positions, add 3 to the values in the overlap region.

After applying all eight transformations, the resulting test output grid would look like this:

0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 2, 4, 2

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
