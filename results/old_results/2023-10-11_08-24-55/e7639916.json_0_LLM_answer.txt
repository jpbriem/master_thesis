LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the value of each cell is either 0 or  eight times the value of the cell immediately to its left (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary). Therefore, the test output can be calculated by applying this pattern to the test input.

Here's one way to do it:

1. Start with the first row of the test input. Since there are no cells to the left of the first cell, we'll set its value to 0.
2. For each subsequent cell in the first row, set its value to 8 times the value of the previous cell (wrapping around to 0 if necessary). So, the second cell's value would be 8 \* 0 = 0; the third cell's value would be 8 \* 0 = 0; and so on.
3. Move on to the second row. Set the first cell's value to 0, since there are no cells to its left. For each subsequent cell, set its value to 8 times the value of the previous cell (wrapping around to 0 if necessary). And so on.
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach the end of the test input.

Using this method, the test output would look like this:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
