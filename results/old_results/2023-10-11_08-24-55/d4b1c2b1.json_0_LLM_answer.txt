LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  From the given training examples, we can observe that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the existing values in the grid. Specifically, the transformations are:

1. Replace a group of cells with the maximum value among the cells in the group.
2. Replace a group of cells with the minimum value among the cells in the group.
3. Replace a group of cells with the average value among the cells in the group.
4. Replace a group of cells with a value that is a function of the number of cells in the group (e.g., 4 cells with values 2, 4, 7, 8 become 2*4*7*8 = 32).

The order of these transformations is not fixed and may vary between different training examples. However, for each transformation, the same operation is applied to all cells in the group simultaneously.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

test input:
7, 1, 7
3, 3, 6
8, 8, 6

First, we apply transformation 1 (replace a group of cells with the maximum value) to the first row:

7 -> 7
1 -> 7
7 -> 7

Next, we apply transformation 2 (replace a group of cells with the minimum value) to the second row:

3 -> 1
3 -> 1
6 -> 1

Then, we apply transformation 3 (replace a group of cells with the average value) to the third row:

8 -> 6
8 -> 6
6 -> 6

Finally, we apply transformation 4 (replace a group of cells with a value that is a function of the number of cells in the group) to the entire grid:

7 + 1 + 7 = 15
3 + 3 + 6 = 12
8 + 8 + 6 = 22

Therefore, the test output would be:

15, 12, 22
