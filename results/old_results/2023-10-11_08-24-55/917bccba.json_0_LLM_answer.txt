LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is repeated three times, with some modifications made to certain elements. Specifically, it seems that element '3' is replaced by element '0' in the first two occurrences of each row, while the third occurrence remains unchanged. Additionally, there are certain positions where element '2' is replaced by element '8'.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
