[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row of the input, the corresponding row of the output is either all 5s, all 0s, or a combination of 5s and 0s. Furthermore, the number of 5s in each row is equal to the number of identical elements in the corresponding row of the input.

Therefore, the general pattern can be described as follows:

1. If the input row has only one element that is repeated three times, the corresponding output row should have all 5s.
2. If the input row has two elements that are repeated twice and a third element that appears once, the corresponding output row should have all 0s.
3. If the input row has three identical elements, the corresponding output row should have a combination of 5s and 0s, with the number of 5s equal to the number of identical elements in the input row.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

test input:
4, 4, 4
2, 3, 2
3, 2, 3

Using the above pattern, we can deduce the following test output:

test output:
5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0

Explanation:

* The first row of the test input has three identical elements (4), so the first row of the test output should have all 5s.
* The second row of the test input has two elements that are repeated twice (2, 3), and a third element that appears once (2), so the second row of the test output should have all 0s.
* The third row of the test input has three identical elements (3), so the third row of the test output should have a combination of 5s and 0s, with the number of 5s equal to the number of identical elements in the input row. Therefore, the third row of the test output should have 5, 0, 0.
