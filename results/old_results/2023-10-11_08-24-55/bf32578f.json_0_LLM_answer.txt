LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where the value in each cell is copied to its neighboring cells, wrapping around the edges of the grid if necessary.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by copying the value in each cell to its neighboring cells, wrapping around the edges of the grid if necessary. This will give us an intermediate result that looks like this:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Next, we can apply the same process again, copying the values in each cell to their neighboring cells, wrapping around the edges of the grid if necessary. This will give us the final test output, which looks like this:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
