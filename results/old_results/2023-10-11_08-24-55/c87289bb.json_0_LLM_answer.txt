LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern appears to be that for each row, the value at position (i, j) is equal to the value at position (i, j-1) if j is even, and is equal to the value at position (i-1, j-1) if j is odd.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is based solely on the given training data, and there may be other patterns or rules that could also produce the same output for the test input.
