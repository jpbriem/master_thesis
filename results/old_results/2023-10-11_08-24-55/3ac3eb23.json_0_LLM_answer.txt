LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions, and then some elements are changed to 0 or 8.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by shifting each row by the number of positions specified in the first column. For example, the first row should be shifted 3 positions to the right, since the first element is 3.

Then, we can apply the following transformations to each element in turn:

* If an element is 0, change it to 8.
* If an element is already 8, leave it unchanged.
* Otherwise (i.e., if an element is neither 0 nor 8), change it to 0.

Here's how the test input would look after applying these transformations:

0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The resulting output would be:

8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0
