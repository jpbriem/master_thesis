LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each case, the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and the values in each row of the output grid are derived from the corresponding row of the input grid by shifting the values by a certain number of positions and possibly reversing their order.

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can follow these steps:

1. Shift the first row of the test input by one position to the right (wrapping around to the beginning of the row if necessary).
2. Reverse the order of the second row of the test input.
3. Shift the third row of the test input by two positions to the left (wrapping around to the end of the row if necessary).
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each row of the test input.

Using this method, we obtain the following test output:

test output:
2, 5, 0, 0, 2, 5
2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 5
3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1

Note that the above solution assumes that the input and output grids have the same dimensions. If the dimensions of the test input grid are different from those of the train input grid, we may need to modify the above steps accordingly.
