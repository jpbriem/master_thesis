LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
2, 2, 1
2, 3, 1
1, 1, 1
train output:
1, 2, 3
1, 2, 0
1, 2, 0
1, 0, 0
1, 0, 0
End of example.
train input:
3, 1, 1, 4
2, 2, 2, 4
4, 4, 4, 4
train output:
4, 2, 1, 3
4, 2, 1, 0
4, 2, 0, 0
4, 0, 0, 0
4, 0, 0, 0
4, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
train input:
8, 8, 2
3, 8, 8
3, 3, 4
3, 3, 4
train output:
3, 8, 4, 2
3, 8, 4, 0
3, 8, 0, 0
3, 8, 0, 0
3, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
train input:
1, 1, 1
2, 2, 1
2, 8, 1
2, 8, 1
train output:
1, 2, 8
1, 2, 8
1, 2, 0
1, 2, 0
1, 0, 0
1, 0, 0
End of example.
test input:
8, 8, 2, 2
1, 8, 8, 2
1, 3, 3, 4
1, 1, 1, 1
test output:[/INST]

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each output value is the maximum of the corresponding input values, except for the last value which is always zero.

Therefore, the solution to the test input would be:

test output:
8, 8, 2, 2
1, 8, 8, 2
1, 3, 3, 4
1, 1, 1, 1

Can you please provide more information or clarify the question?
