LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the number of 2s in each row to the corresponding output value. Specifically:

* If there are no 2s in a row (i.e., all elements are 0), the output is 0.
* If there is one 2 in a row, the output is 8.
* If there are two 2s in a row, the output is 2.
* If there are three or more 2s in a row, the output is 0.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for generating the output from a given input:

1. Count the number of 2s in each row of the input.
2. If there are no 2s, output 0.
3. If there is one 2, output 8.
4. If there are two 2s, output 2.
5. If there are three or more 2s, output 0.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the above rule, we can see that there are no 2s in this input, so the output should be 0.

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2

In this case, there is one 2 in the input, so the output should be 8.

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0

Here, there are two 2s in the input, so the output should be 2.

test input: 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2

In this input, there are three 2s, so the output should be 0.

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2

Again, there are three 2s in this input, so the output should be 0.

The remaining test inputs can be evaluated using the same rule, and the results are as follows:

test input: 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0
output: 8

test input: 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0
output: 2

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
output: 0

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2
output: 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

0, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0
