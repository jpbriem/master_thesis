LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shift.

The modifications appear to be as follows:

* If the shift is horizontal (i.e., the top row is moved left or right), the values in the grid are unchanged.
* If the shift is vertical (i.e., the top row is moved up or down), the values in the grid are inverted (i.e., 0s become 5s and vice versa).
* If the shift is diagonal (i.e., the top row is moved diagonally up and to the right or diagonally up and to the left), the values in the grid are either multiplied by 2 or remain unchanged.

Applying these transformations in sequence seems to produce the desired output for the given input.

Therefore, to obtain the test output, we can apply the same set of transformations to the test input. Here's how the transformations would be applied:

1. Shift the input grid horizontally by 3 positions (i.e., move the top row three positions to the right).
2. Invert the values in the grid (since the shift was horizontal).
3. Shift the grid diagonally up and to the right by 2 positions (i.e., move the top-left corner two positions up and one position to the right).
4. Multiply the values in the grid by 2 (since the shift was diagonal).

The resulting test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5
0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5
0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
