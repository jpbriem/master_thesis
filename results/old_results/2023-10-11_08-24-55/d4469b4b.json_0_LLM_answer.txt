LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the number of 5's in that row corresponds to the number of 5's in the corresponding position in the output row. In particular, it seems that for each row, the number of 5's is equal to the number of 5's in the same position in the output row, minus the number of 5's in the previous row.

Therefore, to determine the output for the test input, we can apply this pattern to each row of the input. Here's how the calculation would work out:

Row 1: 1, 1, 1, 1, 0
The number of 5's in this row is 4. If we subtract the number of 5's in the previous row (which is 0), we get 4. Therefore, the first four elements of the output row should be 5.

Row 2: 0, 0, 1, 0, 1
The number of 5's in this row is 1. If we subtract the number of 5's in the previous row (which is 4), we get -3. Therefore, the second element of the output row should be 0.

Row 3: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
The number of 5's in this row is 1. If we subtract the number of 5's in the previous row (which is -3), we get 4. Therefore, the third element of the output row should be 5.

Row 4: 0, 1, 0, 0, 1
The number of 5's in this row is 1. If we subtract the number of 5's in the previous row (which is 4), we get -3. Therefore, the fourth element of the output row should be 0.

Row 5: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
The number of 5's in this row is 1. If we subtract the number of 5's in the previous row (which is -3), we get 4. Therefore, the fifth element of the output row should be 5.

Therefore, the test output would be:

5, 5, 5, 0, 5
