[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the value of each cell is either 0 or 8, and the number of 8's in each row is always equal. Additionally, the value of each cell is determined by the majority vote of the three cells above it and the three cells to its left (including the current cell). If there is no cell above or to the left, then the value is 0.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input as follows:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
