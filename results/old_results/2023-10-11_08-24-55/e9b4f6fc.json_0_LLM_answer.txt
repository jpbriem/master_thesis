LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid represents a binary number (where 0 represents a "low" digit and 1 represents a "high" digit). The task is to fill in missing values in the grid such that the resulting binary number in each row is consistent with the given output for that row.

To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the given output for each row. For example, looking at the first row, we see that the output is 8. This means that the binary number represented by the first row should have an 8 in the ones place (i.e., 2^3 = 8). Similarly, looking at the second row, we see that the output is 2. This means that the binary number represented by the second row should have a 2 in the ones place (i.e., 2^2 = 4).

Using this reasoning, we can fill in the missing values in the grid as follows:

| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
