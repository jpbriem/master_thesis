LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a group of cells with a new value based on the existing values in the grid.

Here's a summary of the transformations observed in the training data:

1. Replace the top row with 0s.
2. Replace the leftmost column with 0s.
3. Replace the middle row with the value of the cell immediately above it.
4. Replace the rightmost column with the value of the cell immediately below it.
5. Replace the bottom row with 0s.
6. Replace the second row from the top with the value of the cell immediately below it.
7. Replace the third row from the top with the value of the cell immediately above it.
8. Replace the fourth row from the top with the value of the cell diagonally up-left from it.
9. Replace the fifth row from the top with the value of the cell diagonally down-right from it.

Applying these transformations in order to the test input should produce the test output. Here's the result:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the test output may not be unique, as there could be multiple ways to transform the input grid to produce the same output.
