LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

1, 0, 3, 4
0, 0, 2, 1

3, 4, 2, 1
2, 1, 4, 3
4, 3, 1, 2
End of example.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is shifted and possibly reversed.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can break it down into four quadrants:

* Top left (0, 1, 2, 3)
* Top right (0, 3, 1, 0)
* Bottom left (3, 0, 4, 1)
* Bottom right (0, 4, 0, 2)

Applying the same transformation to each quadrant, we get:

* Top left: (1, 2, 3, 4)
* Top right: (3, 4, 2, 1)
* Bottom left: (2, 1, 4, 3)
* Bottom right: (4, 3, 1, 2)

Therefore, the test output would be:

1, 2, 3, 4
3, 4, 2, 1
2, 1, 4, 3
4, 3, 1, 2
