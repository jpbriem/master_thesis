LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical operation (such as AND, OR, or XOR) to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right (i.e., add 1 to each element's index).
2. Apply an AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the result grid by one position down (i.e., add 1 to each element's index).
4. Apply an OR operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
5. Shift the result grid by one position to the left (i.e., subtract 1 from each element's index).
6. Apply an XOR operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 until the desired number of iterations has been reached.

The test input you provided does not follow this pattern, so I cannot provide a correct test output based on the given information. However, if you provide me with additional training data that follows the same pattern, I can use that information to generate a predicted output for the test input.
