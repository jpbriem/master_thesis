LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying the following operations to the input grid:

1. Starting from the top-left corner, iterate through each row and column, applying a modulo 3 operation to each value (wrapping around to 0 when a value reaches 3).
2. For each position (x, y) in the grid, if the value at that position is 0, set the value to the number of positions clockwise from that position that have a value of 2 (again wrapping around to 0 when reaching the edge of the grid).
3. Finally, for each position (x, y) in the grid, set the value to the maximum of the current value and the number of positions counterclockwise from that position that have a value of 2.

Here's how this pattern would be applied to the test input:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

After applying the above operations, the resulting test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the test output values are different from the training output values because the training data only provides examples of patterns, but does not explicitly state the rules for generating those patterns. Therefore, we had to infer the rules from the examples and apply them to the test input to produce the test output.
