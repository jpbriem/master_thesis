LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
2, 1, 2, 1, 2
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 2, 1, 2
0, 0, 1, 1, 1
0, 0, 2, 1, 2
train output:
1, 1
2, 1
End of example.
train input:
8, 6, 0, 6
6, 8, 6, 8
8, 6, 8, 6
6, 8, 6, 8
train output:
8
End of example.
train input:
2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2
2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2
2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0
train output:
5, 5
5, 2
End of example.
test input:
8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0
8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8
1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input row is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output row, based on their position.

The first digit in the input row is replaced by the first digit in the output row, the second digit in the input row is replaced by the second digit in the output row, and so on.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can apply the same substitution method to each digit in the test input row. Here's how it would look like:

test input: 8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0

substitution: 8 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 8 -> 5, 8 -> 5, 0 -> 0, 0 -> 0

test output: 1, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0

So, the test output would be: 1, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0.
