LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shifted grid relative to the original grid.

The modifications appear to be as follows:

* When the shifted grid overlaps with the original grid, the values in the overlap region are replaced with the value 2.
* When the shifted grid does not overlap with the original grid, the values in the shifted grid remain unchanged.

Here's an example of how this pattern would work for the first training input:

1. Shift the grid horizontally by 3 positions to the right. This results in the following grid:
