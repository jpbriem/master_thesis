LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shift.

The first transformation shifts the grid up by 3 positions, and sets the value at position (1, 1) to 5.
The second transformation shifts the grid down by 2 positions, and sets the value at position (4, 4) to 2.
The third transformation shifts the grid left by 2 positions, and sets the value at position (2, 1) to 2.
The fourth transformation shifts the grid right by 3 positions, and sets the value at position (6, 3) to 5.
The fifth transformation shifts the grid up by 1 position, and sets the value at position (1, 1) to 0.
The sixth transformation shifts the grid down by 1 position, and sets the value at position (5, 5) to 0.
The seventh transformation shifts the grid left by 1 position, and sets the value at position (1, 4) to 0.
The eighth transformation shifts the grid right by 1 position, and sets the value at position (5, 1) to 0.

Applying these transformations in sequence to the test input grid should produce the test output grid. Here's how the transformations would be applied:

1. Shift up by 3 positions:

0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2. Shift down by 2 positions:

0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

3. Shift left by 2 positions:

0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

4. Shift right by 3 positions:

0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0
