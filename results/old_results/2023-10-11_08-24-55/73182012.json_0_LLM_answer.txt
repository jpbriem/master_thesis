LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of a rotation and a reflection. Specifically, the transformations are:

1. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise (so that the top row becomes the left column, and vice versa).
2. Reflect the grid vertically (so that the left half becomes the right half, and vice versa).
3. Rotate the grid another 90 degrees clockwise.
4. Reflect the grid horizontally (so that the top half becomes the bottom half, and vice versa).

The order of these transformations is important, as it seems to follow a specific pattern:

1. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Reflect vertically.
3. Rotate another 90 degrees clockwise.
4. Reflect horizontally.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise:

0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0

Next, reflect the grid vertically:

0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0

Now rotate the grid another 90 degrees clockwise:

0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0
