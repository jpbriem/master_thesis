[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each element in the output grid is equal to the number of adjacent elements in the input grid that are equal to 2.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by counting the number of adjacent elements in the input grid that are equal to 2 for each position in the grid. We can then use these counts to determine the value of each element in the output grid.

Here's how this would work for the test input:

1. Count the number of adjacent elements in the input grid that are equal to 2 for each position in the grid:
* Position (0,0) has 0 adjacent elements equal to 2.
* Position (0,1) has 1 adjacent element equal to 2 (at position (0,0)).
* Position (0,2) has 2 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0) and (0,1)).
* Position (0,3) has 3 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2)).
* Position (0,4) has 4 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3)).
* Position (0,5) has 5 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (0,4)).
* Position (0,6) has 6 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), and (0,5)).
* Position (0,7) has 7 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), and (0,6)).
* Position (0,8) has 8 adjacent elements equal to 2 (at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), and (0,7)).
2. Use the counts to determine the value of each element in the output grid:
* Position (0,0) has no adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value remains unchanged at 0.
* Position (0,1) has one adjacent element equal to 2, so its value changes to 2.
* Position (0,2) has two adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 4.
* Position (0,3) has three adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 8.
* Position (0,4) has four adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 16.
* Position (0,5) has five adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 32.
* Position (0,6) has six adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 64.
* Position (0,7) has seven adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 128.
* Position (0,8) has eight adjacent elements equal to 2, so its value changes to 256.

The resulting output grid would look like this:

0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
0 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256

Therefore, the test output would be:

0 2 4 8 16
