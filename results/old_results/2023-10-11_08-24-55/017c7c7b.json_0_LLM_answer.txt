LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation where each row is transformed into its corresponding output row by replacing each digit with its shifted version. The shifts are as follows:

* For the first row, no shift is applied.
* For the second row, a one-position shift is applied, so the digits are moved one position to the right.
* For the third row, a two-position shift is applied, so the digits are moved two positions to the right.
* For the fourth row, a three-position shift is applied, so the digits are moved three positions to the right.

Therefore, to obtain the test output, we can apply the same shifts to the test input:

test input: 1, 1, 1
shifted: 1, 1, 1 (no shift)

test input: 0, 1, 0
shifted: 0, 2, 0 (one-position shift)

test input: 0, 1, 0
shifted: 0, 2, 0 (one-position shift)

test input: 1, 1, 1
shifted: 2, 2, 2 (three-position shift)

test input: 0, 1, 0
shifted: 0, 2, 0 (one-position shift)

test input: 0, 1, 0
shifted: 0, 2, 0 (one-position shift)

Therefore, the test output would be:

1, 1, 1
0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0
2, 2, 2
0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0
