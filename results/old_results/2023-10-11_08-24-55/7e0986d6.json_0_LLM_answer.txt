LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 1s, with some occasional 2s, 3s, and 5s scattered throughout. There doesn't seem to be any discernible logic behind the placement of these numbers, and there's no apparent relationship between the input and output values.

Given this lack of structure, it's difficult to derive a generalizable rule for generating the output values from the input values. However, we can still try to create a simple algorithm that captures the essence of the pattern observed in the training data.

Here's one possible approach:

1. Initialize an empty output list.
2. Iterate through each row of the input matrix.
3. For each row, check if the first element is equal to 0. If it is, set the second element to 1. Otherwise, set the second element to 0.
4. Set the third element to the value of the second element.
5. Set the fourth element to the value of the third element.
6. Set the fifth element to the value of the fourth element.
7. Add the modified row to the output list.
8. Return the output list.

Using this algorithm, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0

output:
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 4, 5, 0

Please note that this solution is based solely on the provided training data and might not generalize well to unseen inputs.
