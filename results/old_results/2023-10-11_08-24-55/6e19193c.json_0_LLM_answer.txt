LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple rotation of the digits in each row by a certain number of positions, where the number of positions is determined by the value in the first column.

In the first set of examples, the rotation is always clockwise (to the right) by 1 position for each digit in the first column that has a value of 7. In the second set of examples, the rotation is always counterclockwise (to the left) by 1 position for each digit in the first column that has a value of 9.

Therefore, to solve the test input, we need to rotate the digits in each row by the appropriate number of positions based on the value in the first column. Here's how the rotation would work for each row:

* If the value in the first column is 0, no rotation is needed.
* If the value in the first column is 7, rotate the digits in the row clockwise by 1 position.
* If the value in the first column is 9, rotate the digits in the row counterclockwise by 1 position.

Here's an example of how this would work for one of the test input rows:

Test input row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

* Value in first column: 0
* Rotation needed: none
* Resulting row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying this logic to all rows of the test input, we get the following test output:

Test output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
