LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input grid is copied verbatim to the corresponding position in the output grid, with some additional values filled in to make the output grid larger. Specifically:

* The first value of each row is repeated three times in the output grid.
* The second value of each row is repeated twice in the output grid.
* The third value of each row is repeated once in the output grid.
* Any remaining empty spaces in the output grid are filled with zeros.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

test input: 0, 1, 0
0, 8, 7
9, 9, 0

test output: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0

Note that the test input and output grids have the same number of rows (3) and columns (3), but the training grids have varying sizes.
