LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, and then the next row is repeated a certain number of times, and so on. Specifically:

* The first row (2, 1, 4) is repeated 3 times.
* The second row (5, 5, 5) is repeated 4 times.
* The third row (0, 0, 0) is repeated 7 times.
* The fourth row (0, 0, 0) is repeated 6 times.
* The fifth row (0, 0, 0) is repeated 5 times.
* The sixth row (0, 0, 0) is repeated 4 times.
* The seventh row (0, 0, 0) is repeated 3 times.
* The eighth row (0, 0, 0) is repeated 2 times.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can apply this pattern to the test input:

* The first row (1, 2, 3, 4, 8) is repeated 3 times.
* The second row (5, 5, 5, 5, 5) is repeated 4 times.
* The third row (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is repeated 7 times.
* The fourth row (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is repeated 6 times.
* The fifth row (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is repeated 5 times.
* The sixth row (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is repeated 4 times.
* The seventh row (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is repeated 3 times.
* The eighth row (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is repeated 2 times.

This gives us the following test output:

1, 2, 3, 4, 8
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
