LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input row is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output row, based on a fixed mapping.

The mapping can be represented as follows:

| Input Digit | Output Digit |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 |
| 6 | 8 |
| 7 | 3 |
| 8 | 1 |
| 9 | 0 |

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can substitute each digit in the input row with the corresponding digit in the output row, using the mapping above. Here's the resulting test output:

test output:
1, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0
1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 2, 0
1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0
1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0

Note that the output values are not necessarily the actual values that would be produced by a real-world cipher. They simply demonstrate the application of the pattern found in the training data to the test input.
