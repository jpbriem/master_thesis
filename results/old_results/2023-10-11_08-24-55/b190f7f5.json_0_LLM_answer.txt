[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a specific order, which seems to be:

1. Shift left (horizontally) by 2 positions
2. Shift up (vertically) by 2 positions
3. Shift right (horizontally) by 2 positions
4. Shift down (vertically) by 2 positions
5. Apply logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid

The resulting grid is then used as the input for the next iteration of the pattern. This process is repeated for a total of 6 iterations.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following results:

Test Input: 3, 0, 0, 1

Iteration 1: Shift left by 2 positions, result = 1, 0, 0, 1
Iteration 2: Shift up by 2 positions, result = 0, 1, 0, 1
Iteration 3: Shift right by 2 positions, result = 1, 0, 1, 0
Iteration 4: Shift down by 2 positions, result = 0, 0, 1, 1
Iteration 5: Apply logical AND operation, result = 0, 0, 1, 1

Therefore, the test output for the first row would be: 0, 0, 1, 1

Similarly, applying the same pattern to the remaining rows of the test input, we get the following results:

Test Input: 0, 2, 2, 0

Iteration 1: Shift left by 2 positions, result = 0, 2, 2, 0
Iteration 2: Shift up by 2 positions, result = 0, 0, 2, 2
Iteration 3: Shift right by 2 positions, result = 0, 2, 2, 0
Iteration 4: Shift down by 2 positions, result = 0, 0, 2, 2
Iteration 5: Apply logical AND operation, result = 0, 0, 2, 2

Therefore, the test output for the second row would be: 0, 0, 2, 2

Repeating this process for all four rows of the test input, we get the complete test output:

0, 0, 1, 1
0, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 3, 3

Note that the above solution assumes that the input grid is represented as a 2D array of binary digits (i.e., 0s and 1s). In case the input grid is represented as a 2D array of integers (as in the provided training data), the logic of the pattern would remain the same, but the actual values in the grid would need to be adjusted accordingly.
