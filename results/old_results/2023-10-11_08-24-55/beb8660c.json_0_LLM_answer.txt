LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in the input row to the corresponding positions in the output row. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input row is used to determine the value of a single position in the output row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply map each value in the test input row to its corresponding position in the test output row, using the same rules that were followed in the train input and output pairs.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0
0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
