[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is shifted by a certain number of positions to the left or right, and then the elements are rearranged in a specific order.

In the first example, the first row of the input (3, 3, 8) is shifted three positions to the left, resulting in the output (0, 0, 5). The second row (3, 7, 0) is shifted two positions to the right, resulting in the output (0, 7, 3). The third row (5, 0, 0) is shifted five positions to the left, resulting in the output (8, 3, 3).

In the second example, the first row (5, 5, 2) is shifted two positions to the right, resulting in the output (0, 0, 0). The second row (1, 0, 0) is shifted one position to the left, resulting in the output (0, 0, 1). The third row (0, 0, 0) remains unchanged, resulting in the output (2, 5, 5).

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rules for transforming the input into the output:

1. Each row of the input is shifted by a certain number of positions (which may be negative) to the left or right.
2. The elements in each row are rearranged in a specific order, which appears to be alternating between ascending and descending order.

Applying these rules to the test input (6, 3, 5), we get:

1. Shift the first row (6, 3, 5) three positions to the left, resulting in (3, 5, 6).
2. Rearrange the elements in the first row in descending order, resulting in (5, 6, 3).
3. Shift the second row (6, 8, 0) two positions to the right, resulting in (8, 0, 6).
4. Rearrange the elements in the second row in ascending order, resulting in (0, 6, 8).
5. Shift the third row (4, 0, 0) four positions to the left, resulting in (0, 0, 4).
6. Rearrange the elements in the third row in descending order, resulting in (0, 0, 4).

Therefore, the test output would be:

5, 6, 3
0, 6, 8
0, 0, 4
