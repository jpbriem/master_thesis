LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, followed by a third row that is either the same as one of the previous two rows or a combination of elements from both. Specifically:

* The first row is repeated as the second row.
* The third row is either the same as the first row or a combination of elements from the first two rows.

Based on this pattern, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
1, 3, 2
3, 3, 2
1, 3, 2

Applying the pattern, we get:

test output:
1, 3, 2
3, 3, 2
1, 3, 2

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

1, 3, 2
3, 3, 2
1, 3, 2
