LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation that replaces certain groups of digits with other groups. Specifically, it seems that the input is transformed by replacing each group of three consecutive digits (starting from the left) with a new group of three consecutive digits, based on the following rules:

* If the original group contains 0, 0, and 0, then the new group is 0, 5, 1.
* If the original group contains 0, 5, and 0, then the new group is 0, 1, 5.
* If the original group contains 0, 0, and 5, then the new group is 0, 5, 1.
* If the original group contains 0, 5, and 1, then the new group is 0, 1, 5.
* If the original group contains 0, 1, and 0, then the new group is 0, 5, 1.
* If the original group contains 0, 1, and 5, then the new group is 0, 1, 5.
* If the original group contains 5, 0, and 0, then the new group is 5, 1, 5.
* If the original group contains 5, 0, and 1, then the new group is 5, 1, 5.

Using this pattern, we can transform the test input to get the test output:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0, 5, 1, 5, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5
0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1
0, 5, 1, 5, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 1, 5, 0, 5, 1, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
