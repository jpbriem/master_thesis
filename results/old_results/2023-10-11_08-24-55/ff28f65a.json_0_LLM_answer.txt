LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 1s and 0s, with the number of 1s equal to the number of 2s in each row.

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern can be described as follows:

1. Start with an empty grid.
2. For each row, starting from the second row, place a 1 in the first position if the corresponding position in the previous row contains a 2. Otherwise, place a 0.
3. Repeat step 2 for each subsequent row until the end of the grid.
4. The resulting grid is the output.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

test output:
1, 0, 1
0, 1, 0
1, 0, 0
End of example.
