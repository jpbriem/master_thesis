LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is either 0, 8, or a copy of a cell from the corresponding position in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that for each row of the input grid:

* If the first cell is 0, the corresponding cell in the output grid is 8.
* If the first cell is not 0, the corresponding cell in the output grid is a copy of the second cell from the left in the input grid.
* If the second cell from the left in the input grid is 0, the corresponding cell in the output grid is 8. Otherwise, it appears to be a copy of the third cell from the left in the input grid.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing cells of the test input to create a complete 2D grid:

0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 3, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern to the completed grid, we get the following test output:

8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 3, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 3, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 3, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 3, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 3, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 3, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 3, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 0, 8
0, 0, 0, 3, 0
