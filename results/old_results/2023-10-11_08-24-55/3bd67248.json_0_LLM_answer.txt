LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 2s, with an occasional 4 thrown in. It looks like the output for each row is just a shifted version of the input, with the last two digits of the input becoming the first two digits of the output.

Based on this observation, we can create a simple algorithm to generate the output for a given input:

1. Split the input into two halves: the first half contains the first six digits, and the second half contains the last six digits.
2. Shift the second half of the input one position to the left, so that the last digit of the second half becomes the first digit of the output.
3. Concatenate the two halves, with the first half followed by the shifted second half, to obtain the complete output.

Here's how this algorithm would work for the test input you provided:

Test input: 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

First half: 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Second half: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Shifted second half: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3
Concatenated output: 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3

Therefore, the test output for the given input would be: 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.
