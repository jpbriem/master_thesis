LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple rotation. Each row of the input is rotated by a certain number of positions to the right, and the resulting row is the output for that input.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by rotating each row by the number of positions specified in the first column of the input. For example, the first row should be rotated 3 positions to the right (since the first element in the first column is 3), the second row should be rotated 2 positions to the right (since the second element in the first column is 2), and so on.

Here's how the test input would look after applying these rotations:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The resulting rows are the test output:

7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
