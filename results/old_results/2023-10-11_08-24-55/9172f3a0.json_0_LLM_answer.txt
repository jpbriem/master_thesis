LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each value in the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some padding zeros added to fill out the output grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply copy each value in the test input to the corresponding position in the test output, adding padding zeros as needed:

test input: 0, 1, 0
test output: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test input: 0, 0, 6
test output: 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test input: 6, 1, 0
test output: 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

test output: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
