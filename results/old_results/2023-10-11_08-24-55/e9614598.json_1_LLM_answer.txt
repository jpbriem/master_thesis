LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each element in the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some modifications based on the value of certain elements. Specifically, when an element in the input is equal to 1, it seems to be replaced by 3 in the output, while all other elements remain unchanged.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the test input should result in the following test output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible solution based on the given pattern. If there are any errors or ambiguities in the input data, the output may differ accordingly.
