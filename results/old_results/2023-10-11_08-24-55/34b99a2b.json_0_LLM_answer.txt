[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the values in the input row to corresponding values in the output row, based on their positions in the grid. Specifically, it seems that each value in the input row is mapped to a value in the output row, starting from the top-left corner and moving rightward and then downward.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. The first value in the input row (representing the top-left cell) is mapped to the first value in the output row.
2. The second value in the input row (representing the top-right cell) is mapped to the second value in the output row.
3. The third value in the input row (representing the middle-left cell) is mapped to the third value in the output row.
4. The fourth value in the input row (representing the middle-right cell) is mapped to the fourth value in the output row.
5. The fifth value in the input row (representing the bottom-left cell) is mapped to the fifth value in the output row.
6. The sixth value in the input row (representing the bottom-right cell) is mapped to the sixth value in the output row.
7. The seventh value in the input row (representing the middle-bottom cell) is mapped to the seventh value in the output row.
8. The eighth value in the input row (representing the bottom-middle cell) is mapped to the eighth value in the output row.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to obtain the test output:

test input:
0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern, we get:

test output:
2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0
