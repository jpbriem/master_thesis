LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a rotation to the resulting grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right (i.e., add a copy of the first column to the end of the grid).
2. Rotate the resulting grid by 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Shift the rotated grid by one position upward (i.e., add a copy of the first row to the end of the grid).
4. Rotate the resulting grid by another 90 degrees clockwise.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the desired number of rotations has been reached.
6. Finally, shift the resulting grid by one position to the left (i.e., remove the last column from the grid) and rotate it by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Applying this pattern to the test input should give us the test output. Here's how the pattern would be applied to the test input:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 5 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 5 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 5 5 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 1 0
0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2. Rotate the resulting grid by 90 degrees clockwise:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

3. Shift the rotated grid by one position upward:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

4. Rotate the resulting grid by another 90 degrees clockwise:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
