LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each row of the input grid consists of a sequence of 8s and 3s, with occasional appearances of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7. The output for each row is a single digit that corresponds to the number of consecutive identical digits in the row.

For example, in the first training input, the sequence of digits is 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, which has a pattern of alternating 3s and 4s. Therefore, the output for this row would be 2 (the number of times the digit 3 appears consecutively). Similarly, the second row has a pattern of alternating 3s and 1s, so the output would be 1.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
