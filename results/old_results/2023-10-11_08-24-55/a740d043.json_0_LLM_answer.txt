LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that for each row, the first occurrence of a value greater than 1 is replaced by the number of positions to the right of that value that have a value greater than 1. If there are no values greater than 1 in the row, then the output for that row is 0.

For example, in the first training input, the first row has values 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and the output is 2, indicating that there are two positions to the right of the first 1 that have values greater than 1. Similarly, in the second row, the output is 3, indicating that there are three positions to the right of the first 1 that have values greater than 1.

In the second training input, the first row has values 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and the output is again 2, indicating that there are two positions to the right of the first 1 that have values greater than 1. In the third row, the output is 0, indicating that there are no values greater than 1 in that row.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following output:

test output: 2, 2, 0
