LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each example, the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and each element in the output grid is equal to the number of elements in the corresponding position in the input grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can transform it into a 2D grid with the same dimensions as the train input grids. Each element in the test input grid would have a value of 0, since there are no non-zero elements in the test input.

Using the same logic as the train input and output pairs, we can create a test output grid by applying the following rules:

* If an element in the test input grid is 0, then the corresponding element in the test output grid should also be 0.
* If an element in the test input grid is non-zero (i.e., 1), then the corresponding element in the test output grid should be equal to the number of non-zero elements in the same row, column, or diagonal as the non-zero element.

Here's how the test input and output grids would look like:

Test Input Grid:
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 0
7, 1, 0, 0
7, 1, 3, 0
7, 1, 3, 3
7, 1, 4, 4

Test Output Grid:
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1
7, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

1, 1, 1, 1
7, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 7, 7
