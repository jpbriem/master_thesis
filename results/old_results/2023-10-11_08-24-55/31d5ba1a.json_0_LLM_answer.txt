LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits. Each digit in the input is either 0, 4, 6, or 9, and the corresponding digit in the output is always 6.

Therefore, the rule for generating the output from the input seems to be:

1. Start with the first digit of the input. If it's 0, 4, or 6, output 6. If it's 9, output 0.
2. For each subsequent digit of the input, if the previous digit was 0, 4, or 6, output 6. If the previous digit was 9, output 0.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the end of the input.

Using this rule, we can generate the test output for the given test input:

test input: 9, 9, 0, 9, 0

1. Start with the first digit 9. Output 6.
2. The second digit is also 9, so output 0.
3. The third digit is 0, so output 6.
4. The fourth digit is 9, so output 0.
5. The fifth digit is 0, so output 6.

test output: 6, 0, 6, 0, 6
