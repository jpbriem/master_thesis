LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the value of each cell is either 0 or the maximum value among all cells in that row. In particular, it seems that the value of each cell is determined by comparing the value of that cell with the maximum value among all cells in the same row, and if the value of the cell is greater than or equal to the maximum value, then the value of the cell is set to 0, otherwise, the value of the cell remains unchanged.

Therefore, applying this pattern to the final test input, we get the following test output:
