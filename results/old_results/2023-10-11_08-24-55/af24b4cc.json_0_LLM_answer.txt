LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of a rotation and a reflection. Specifically, the transformations are applied in the following order:

1. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise (so that the top row becomes the left column).
2. Reflect the grid vertically (so that the left column becomes the right column).
3. Rotate the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise (so that the bottom row becomes the left column).
4. Reflect the grid horizontally (so that the left column becomes the top row).

Here's an illustration of the transformations applied to the first input grid:

1. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 6 6 0 9 7 0
0 8 3 0 6 3 0 9 7 0
0 3 8 0 3 6 0 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
2. Reflect vertically:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 6 6 0 9 7 0
0 8 3 0 6 3 0 9 7 0
0 3 8 0 3 6 0 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
3. Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 6 6 0 3 3 0 7 7 0
0 3 3 0 8 8 0 7 6 0
0 8 8 0 3 3 0 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
4. Reflect horizontally:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 7 0 3 3 0 6 6 0
0 3 3 0 8 8 0 6 6 0
0 8 8 0 3 3 0 6 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
The resulting grid is the test output.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 6 6 0 4 4 0
0 3 8 0 3 5 0 4 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 7 1 0 9 9 0
0 2 2 0 7 7 0 1 9 0
0 2 2 0 7 1 0 9 9 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
