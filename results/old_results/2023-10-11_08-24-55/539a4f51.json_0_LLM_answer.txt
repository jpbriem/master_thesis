LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row is a palindrome, with the center element being repeated twice. Additionally, the elements in each row are arranged in a specific order, with the first and last elements being equal, and the second and second-to-last elements being equal.

Based on this pattern, the test output for the given test input would be:

test output:
7, 7, 3, 2, 2
7, 7, 3, 2, 2
3, 3, 3, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 2, 2
