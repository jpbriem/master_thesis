LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input grid is copied to the corresponding position in the output grid, except for the first column, which is filled with zeros. Therefore, the solution to the problem is simply to copy the input grid to the output grid, without modifying it in any way.

Here's the step-by-step pattern:

1. Copy the first row of the input grid to the first row of the output grid.
2. Copy the second row of the input grid to the second row of the output grid.
3. Copy the third row of the input grid to the third row of the output grid.
4. Fill the first column of the output grid with zeros.
5. Copy the remaining rows of the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test input:
4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3

test output:
4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3
