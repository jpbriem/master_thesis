[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is shifted by a certain number of positions. Specifically, it seems that each row is shifted by a number of positions equal to the number of zeros in that row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by counting the number of zeros in each row:

Row 1: 2 zeros
Row 2: 3 zeros
Row 3: 2 zeros
Row 4: 3 zeros

Then, we can shift each row by the corresponding number of positions:

Row 1: Shift by 2 positions (since there are 2 zeros in this row)
Row 2: Shift by 3 positions (since there are 3 zeros in this row)
Row 3: Shift by 2 positions (since there are 2 zeros in this row)
Row 4: Shift by 3 positions (since there are 3 zeros in this row)

The resulting shifts are:

Row 1: [2, 2, 0, 2] -> [0, 2, 2, 2]
Row 2: [0, 2, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 2, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, 2, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 2]
Row 4: [2, 0, 0, 0] -> [2, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the test output would be:

[0, 2, 2, 2]
[0, 0, 2, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 0]
