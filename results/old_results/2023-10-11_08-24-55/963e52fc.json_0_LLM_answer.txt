[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each example, the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and each element in the output grid is either 0 or a copy of the corresponding element in the input grid, shifted by some number of positions in a consistent way.

In particular, it seems that each row of the input grid is shifted by a certain number of positions (which may be positive, negative, or zero) to produce the corresponding row of the output grid. The shifts appear to be independent of each other, so we can analyze each row separately.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern for each row:

* Row 1: No shift, just copy the input row directly to the output row.
* Row 2: Shift left by 2 positions.
* Row 3: Shift right by 2 positions.
* Row 4: No shift, just copy the input row directly to the output row.
* Row 5: Shift left by 1 position.
* Row 6: Shift right by 1 position.

Therefore, to generate the test output from the test input, we can apply the above pattern to each row of the input grid. Here's how the test output would look like:

Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (no shift, copy directly)
Row 2: 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1 (shift left by 2)
Row 3: 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1 (shift right by 2)
Row 4: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (no shift, copy directly)
Row 5: 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2 (shift left by 1)
Row 6: 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2 (shift right by 1)

So, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1
3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2
2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2
