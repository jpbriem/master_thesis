LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each value in the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some minor modifications.

In the first train input, the values 0 and 6 are alternating horizontally, and the output reflects this pattern. In the second train input, the values 0, 3, and 4 are arranged vertically, and the output shows the same arrangement. In the third train input, the values 0, 8, and 6 are placed diagonally, and the output follows the same diagonal pattern.

Based on this observation, we can create a general rule for constructing the output from the input:

1. Start by filling the output grid with zeros.
2. For each row of the input, copy the values left to right into the corresponding row of the output, skipping over any existing values.
3. If a value in the input is zero, leave the corresponding spot in the output unchanged. Otherwise, replace the value in the output with the value from the input.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each row of the input.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the above rules, we can generate the test output as follows:

0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The resulting test output is:

0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3
0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
