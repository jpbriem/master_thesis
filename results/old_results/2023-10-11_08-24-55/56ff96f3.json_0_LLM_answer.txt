LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple copying mechanism, where each row is copied and shifted by some number of positions.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by shifting the first row by 0 positions (since there are no values in the first row), then shift the second row by 1 position to the right (since there is an 8 in the second row). We continue this process for each row, shifting by 1 position to the right for each row until we reach the last row, which we shift by 6 positions to the left.

Therefore, the test output would be:

8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this pattern only works for the specific case of the training data provided, and may not generalize well to other cases.
