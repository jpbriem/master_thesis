LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right (i.e., add 1 to each element's index).
2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the result of step 2 by one position to the down (i.e., add 1 to each element's index).
4. Apply a logical AND operation to the result of step 3 and the original grid.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a specified condition is met (e.g., until a certain number of elements in the grid have been changed).

The test input you provided does not conform to the pattern of the training data. Specifically, the test input has a different shape than the training inputs, and it contains values other than 0 and 2. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer for the test output based on the given information.
