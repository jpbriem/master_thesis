LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used to transform the input into the output is a simple rotation of the digits. Specifically, it seems that the digits in each row are being rotated three positions to the right (or four positions to the left).

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can simply rotate each row of digits by three positions to the right (or four positions to the left):

test input:
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0

Rotated output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0
