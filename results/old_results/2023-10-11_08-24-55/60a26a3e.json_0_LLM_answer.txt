LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the value of each cell is determined by the number of cells with a value greater than or equal to 2 in the three rows above it and the three columns to its left.

Here's how this pattern can be applied to the final test input:

| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

The first row has no cells with a value greater than or equal to 2 in the three rows above it, so the value of the first cell is 0. The second row has two cells with values greater than or equal to 2 in the three rows above it (the second cell in the first row and the third cell in the second row), so the value of the second cell is 2. The third row also has two cells with values greater than or equal to 2 in the three rows above it (the second cell in the first row and the third cell in the second row), so the value of the third cell is 2.

Therefore, the test output would be:

| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 2 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

Note that this pattern only considers the values in the three rows above and the three columns to the left of each cell when determining its value. It does not consider the values in the rest of the grid.
