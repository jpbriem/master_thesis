LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 1s, with an occasional 7 or 8 thrown in. There doesn't seem to be any particular logic to the placement of these numbers, and the pattern doesn't appear to repeat after a certain number of steps.

Given this, I would suggest that the next number in the sequence would be determined by whatever the previous number was. For example, if the previous number was 0, then the next number would be 1, and vice versa. If the previous number was 7 or 8, then the next number would still follow the alternating pattern of 0s and 1s.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
