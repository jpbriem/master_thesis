LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a specific order, which seems to be:

1. Shift the grid left by 1 position.
2. Shift the grid right by 1 position.
3. Shift the grid up by 1 position.
4. Shift the grid down by 1 position.
5. Shift the grid left by 2 positions.
6. Shift the grid right by 2 positions.
7. Shift the grid up by 2 positions.
8. Shift the grid down by 2 positions.

The final output is obtained by applying a logical AND operation to the transformed grids.

Therefore, to obtain the test output, we can apply the same set of transformations to the test input grid:

1. Shift the grid left by 1 position:

0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

2. Shift the grid right by 1 position:

0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

3. Shift the grid up by 1 position:

0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

4. Shift the grid down by 1 position:

0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

5. Shift the grid left by 2 positions:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

6. Shift the grid right by 2 positions:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

7. Shift the grid up by 2 positions:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

8. Shift the grid down by 2 positions:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

Then, we apply a logical AND operation to the transformed grids:

0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
