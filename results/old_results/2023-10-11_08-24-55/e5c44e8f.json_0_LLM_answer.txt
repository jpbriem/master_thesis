[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be consistent across all the training examples.

Here's a summary of the pattern:

1. Shift the grid horizontally by 3 positions to the right.
2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the grid vertically by 2 positions down.
4. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
5. Shift the grid diagonally by 2 positions down and 1 position to the left.
6. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
7. Shift the grid vertically by 1 position up.
8. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
9. Shift the grid horizontally by 1 position to the left.
10. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Using this pattern, we can now apply the transformations to the test input grid:

1. Shift the grid horizontally by 3 positions to the right:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
3. Shift the grid vertically by 2 positions down:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
4. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
5. Shift the grid diagonally by 2 positions down and 1 position to the left:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
6. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
7. Shift the grid vertically by 1 position up:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
9. Shift the grid horizontally by 1 position to the left:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
10. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
