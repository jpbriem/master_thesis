LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each row is copied and shifted by some number of positions. The shift amount seems to be constant for each row, and the same shift amount is applied to all elements in that row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by identifying the shift amounts for each row. From the train input, we can see that the first row has a shift amount of 0, the second row has a shift amount of 1, the third row has a shift amount of 2, and so on. Therefore, we can apply the following shifts to each row of the test input:

* Row 1: shift = 0 (no shift)
* Row 2: shift = 1
* Row 3: shift = 2
* Row 4: shift = 3
* Row 5: shift = 4
* Row 6: shift = 5
* Row 7: shift = 6
* Row 8: shift = 7
* Row 9: shift = 8

After applying these shifts, we can combine the resulting rows into a single 2D array, which will give us the test output. Here's what the test output would look like based on the given test input:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
