LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern appears to be that for each row, the value of each cell is either 0 or 8, and the number of 8's in each row is equal. Moreover, the 8's are always grouped together, meaning they are adjacent to each other.

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern can be summarized as follows:

1. Start with an empty row.
2. For each cell in the row, assign the value 0.
3. For every second cell (starting from the first cell), change the value to 8.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the row.
5. If there are an odd number of cells in the row, assign the last cell the value 8.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get the following test output:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

As expected, the test output follows the same pattern as the training data.
