LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data seems to be that for each row of the input, the corresponding row of the output is obtained by taking the maximum value of the three elements in that row, and then repeating it three times.

Therefore, the test output for the test input would be:

test output: 3, 3, 3

Explanation:

* The first row of the test input has values 0, 0, and 5. The maximum value in this row is 5, which is repeated three times to give 3, 3, 3.
* The second row of the test input has values 5, 0, and 0. The maximum value in this row is 5, which is repeated three times to give 5, 5, 5.
* The third row of the test input has values 0, 5, and 0. The maximum value in this row is 5, which is repeated three times to give 5, 5, 5.

Therefore, the test output is 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5.
