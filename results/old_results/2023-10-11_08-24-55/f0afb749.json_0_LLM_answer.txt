LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each example, the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and each element in the output grid is either 0 or a copy of a corresponding element in the input grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the test input, and then fill it in according to the following rules:

* For each row of the test input that contains only 0s, set the corresponding row in the output grid to 0.
* For each row of the test input that contains at least one non-zero value, set the corresponding row in the output grid to the value of the first non-zero element in that row.

Using this approach, we obtain the following output for the test input:

test output:
0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0
4, 0, 0

In this output, the first row is filled with 0s because the first row of the test input contains only 0s. The second row is also filled with 0s because there are no non-zero elements in the second row of the test input. The third row is filled with 4s because the third row of the test input contains a single 4.
