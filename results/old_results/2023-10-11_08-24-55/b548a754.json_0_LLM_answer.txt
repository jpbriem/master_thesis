LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is being repeated three times, with some elements modified in certain ways. Specifically:

* Each element in the first column (index 0) is set to 0.
* Each element in the second column (index 1) is set to 2 if the corresponding element in the first column is 0, and is set to 1 otherwise.
* Each element in the third column (index 2) is set to 1 if the corresponding element in the first column is 0, and is set to 2 otherwise.
* Each element in the fourth column (index 3) is set to 2 if the corresponding element in the first column is 0, and is set to 1 otherwise.
* Each element in the fifth column (index 4) is set to 1 if the corresponding element in the first column is 0, and is set to 2 otherwise.
* Each element in the sixth column (index 5) is set to 2 if the corresponding element in the first column is 0, and is set to 1 otherwise.
* Each element in the seventh column (index 6) is set to 0.
* Each element in the eighth column (index 7) is set to 0.
* Each element in the ninth column (index 8) is set to 0.
* Each element in the tenth column (index 9) is set to 0.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The first row of the test input has all elements set to 0, so the first row of the test output will also have all elements set to 0.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
