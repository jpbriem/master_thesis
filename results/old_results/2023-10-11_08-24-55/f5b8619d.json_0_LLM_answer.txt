LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input values. Each row of the input is transformed into a corresponding row of the output, with the following rules:

1. If the input value is 0, the output value is 8.
2. If the input value is not 0, the output value is the same as the input value.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 3, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 3
3, 0, 0, 0

Which can be transformed into:

8, 8, 3, 8
8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 3, 8
3, 8, 8, 8

So, the test output is:

8, 8, 3, 8
8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 3, 8
3, 8, 8, 8
