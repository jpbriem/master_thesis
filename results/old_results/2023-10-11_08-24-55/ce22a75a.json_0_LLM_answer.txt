LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple logic where the output for each cell is determined by the number of neighboring cells that have a value of 5.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the pattern:

1. If a cell has a value of 5, it will output 1 regardless of the values of its neighbors.
2. If a cell has a value of 0 and exactly one of its neighbors has a value of 5, it will output 1.
3. If a cell has a value of 0 and two or more of its neighbors have a value of 5, it will output 0.
4. If a cell has a value of 0 and none of its neighbors have a value of 5, it will output 0.

Based on this pattern, we can apply it to the test input to get the test output:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the test output is derived by applying the pattern to each cell in the test input, taking into account the values of its neighbors.
