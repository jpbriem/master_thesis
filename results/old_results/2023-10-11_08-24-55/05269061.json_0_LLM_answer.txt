[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input values. Each output value is equal to the number of consecutive identical values in the corresponding position in the input.

For example, in the first train input, the output value at position 2 is 8 because there are 8 consecutive identical values (0s) in that position in the input. Similarly, the output value at position 6 is 3 because there are 3 consecutive identical values (0s) in that position in the input.

Applying this pattern to the test input, we can calculate the test output as follows:

position 1: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 = 2 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 2
position 2: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0 = 3 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 3
position 3: 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0 = 4 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 4
position 4: 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0 = 3 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 3
position 5: 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0 = 2 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 2
position 6: 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4 = 4 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 4
position 7: 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0 = 4 consecutive identical values (0s), so output = 4

Therefore, the test output would be:
2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4

Note that this pattern assumes that the input values are non-negative integers. If negative values or other non-integer values are possible, a different pattern may be required.
