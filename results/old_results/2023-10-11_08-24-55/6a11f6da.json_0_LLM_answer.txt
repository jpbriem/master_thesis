LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical operation (either AND, OR, or XOR) to the elements in the shifted grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right (i.e., add 1 to each element's index).
2. Apply an AND operation to the elements in the shifted grid.
3. Shift the result back to the left by one position (i.e., subtract 1 from each element's index).
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a total of three times.
5. After the third iteration, apply an OR operation to the resulting grid.
6. Finally, shift the output grid by one position to the right (i.e., add 1 to each element's index) to obtain the final result.

Using this pattern, we can now compute the test output for the given test input:

test input: 1, 0, 1, 1, 1

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right: 2, 1, 2, 2, 2
2. Apply an AND operation to the elements in the shifted grid: 2, 1, 2, 2, 2
3. Shift the result back to the left by one position: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a total of three times:
	* Iteration 1: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2
	* Iteration 2: 1, 2, 2, 2, 2
	* Iteration 3: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
5. Apply an OR operation to the resulting grid: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
6. Shift the output grid by one position to the right: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4.
