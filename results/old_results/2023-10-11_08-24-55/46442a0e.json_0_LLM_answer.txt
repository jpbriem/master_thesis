LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated twice, with the second occurrence shifted by one position to the right. The output for each row is the concatenation of the two rows.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

1, 4, 1, 4, 9, 4, 9, 1, 9
