LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row is a palindrome, with the center element being the highest value in the row. The output for each row is the same as the input, but with the center element replaced by its corresponding output value.

Based on this pattern, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The center elements of each row are 8, 0, 7, 0, 0, 2, and 0, respectively. Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

This is the predicted test output based on the pattern in the training data.
