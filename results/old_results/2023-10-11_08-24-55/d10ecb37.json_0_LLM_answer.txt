LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
4, 3, 6, 4, 0, 6
6, 0, 0, 3, 3, 4
6, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0
0, 3, 6, 0, 4, 6
0, 6, 3, 0, 4, 3
3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 0
train output:
4, 3
6, 0
End of example.
train input:
2, 4, 2, 2, 5, 2, 4, 5
2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2
4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4
2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 4, 2, 5
2, 4, 2, 2, 5, 2, 4, 5
2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2
4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4
2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 4, 2, 5
train output:
2, 4
2, 5
End of example.
train input:
3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1
1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3

2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3
3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2
3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1
1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3
1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4
4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1
train output:
3, 2
1, 4
End of example.
test input:
9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 9
2, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 2
6, 9, 9, 2, 2, 9, 9, 6
9, 2, 6, 9, 9, 6, 2, 9

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of numbers. Each number in the input is repeated in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

9, 6
2, 9
6, 9
9, 2
2, 9
9, 6
6, 2
9, 9
