LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, the pattern appears to be that each row of the input grid is either a copy of the previous row or a shifted version of the previous row by one position to the right. Additionally, some rows may have a random value of 8 or 2 added to them.

Therefore, the test output can be obtained by applying this pattern to the test input. Here's how the test output can be derived:

1. The first row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8. We can apply the pattern by shifting the previous row by one position to the right, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8.
2. The second row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1. We can apply the pattern by copying the previous row, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1.
3. The third row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0. We can apply the pattern by shifting the previous row by one position to the right, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0.
4. The fourth row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0. We can apply the pattern by copying the previous row, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0.
5. The fifth row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. We can apply the pattern by shifting the previous row by one position to the right, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
6. The sixth row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. We can apply the pattern by copying the previous row, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
7. The seventh row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8. We can apply the pattern by shifting the previous row by one position to the right, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8.
8. The eighth row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1. We can apply the pattern by copying the previous row, which gives us 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1.
9. The ninth row of the test input is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0. We can apply the pattern by shifting the previous row by one position to
