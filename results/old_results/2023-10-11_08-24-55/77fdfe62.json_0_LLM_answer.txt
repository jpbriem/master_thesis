[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. Each row of the input grid is transformed into a corresponding row of the output grid through a series of operations that involve shifting, rotating, and reflecting the bits.

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can perform the following steps:

1. Shift each row of the input grid one position to the right (wrapping around to the left if necessary).
2. Rotate each row of the input grid by 180 degrees (so that the top becomes the bottom and vice versa).
3. Reflect each row of the input grid over the vertical axis (so that the left half becomes the right half and vice versa).
4. For each row of the input grid, set the first two bits to 0 and the last two bits to 1.
5. Set the second bit of each row to 1 if the third bit is 1, and set the fourth bit to 1 if the sixth bit is 1.
6. Set the eighth bit of each row to 1 if the seventh bit is 1.

Here's how these operations would transform the test input:

| 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 5 |

The resulting transformed grid is:

| 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 6 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 8 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 5 |

Therefore, the test output would be:

| 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
