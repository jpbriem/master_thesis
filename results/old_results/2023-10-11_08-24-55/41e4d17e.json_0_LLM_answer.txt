LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the first eight cells contain the value 8, followed by a single cell containing a value of either 1 or 6, and then another eight cells containing the value 8.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
