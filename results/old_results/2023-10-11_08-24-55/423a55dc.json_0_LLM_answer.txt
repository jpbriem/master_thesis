LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that each row of the input grid is either entirely zeroes or has a single value (either 8 or 7) repeated across all cells in that row. In addition, there may be some empty rows between non-empty rows.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is based solely on the provided training data and does not take into account any additional rules or constraints that may be applicable in the actual problem.
