LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row of input, the corresponding output value is the number of 0s that appear before the first non-zero value in that row. If there are no non-zero values in the row, then the output value is 0.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The reasoning behind this pattern is that the output value represents the number of "steps" taken to reach the first non-zero value in the row, where each 0 value takes up one step. Therefore, if there are no non-zero values in the row, then the output value is 0, indicating that no steps were needed to reach the end of the row.
