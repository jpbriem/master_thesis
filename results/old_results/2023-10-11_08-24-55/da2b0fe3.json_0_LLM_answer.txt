LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 2s, with occasional 5s appearing in certain positions.

Here's a possible way to generate the output for the given test input:

1. Start by filling the first row with 0s, since the first input value is 0.
2. For each subsequent row, alternate between 0 and 2, starting with 2. So, the second row would be 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
3. Whenever a 5 appears in the input, replace the corresponding position in the output with 3. For example, when the third row of the input is 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, the corresponding positions in the output should be 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.
4. Continue this pattern until all rows have been filled.

Using this method, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
