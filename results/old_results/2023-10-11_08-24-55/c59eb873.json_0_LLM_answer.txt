[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid. In each example, the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and each element in the output grid is either a copy of the corresponding element in the input grid or a value that is derived from it (either by adding 1 or 2 to it, or by copying it unchanged).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the test input, and then fill it in row by row using the following rules:

* For each row of the input grid, if the first element is non-zero, set the first element of the corresponding row in the output grid to the sum of the first two elements of the input row. Otherwise, set the first element of the output row to zero.
* Set the second element of the output row to the second element of the input row.
* If the third element of the input row is non-zero, set the third element of the output row to the sum of the third and fourth elements of the input row. Otherwise, set the third element of the output row to zero.
* Set the fourth element of the output row to the fourth element of the input row.
* If the fifth element of the input row is non-zero, set the fifth element of the output row to the sum of the fifth and sixth elements of the input row. Otherwise, set the fifth element of the output row to zero.
* Set the sixth element of the output row to the sixth element of the input row.

Using this pattern, we can compute the test output as follows:

test input: 2, 0, 0, 7, 8
output: 2, 0, 0, 7, 8

test input: 2, 1, 1, 0, 0
output: 2, 2, 1, 1, 0

test input: 0, 5, 6, 6, 0
output: 0, 5, 6, 6, 0

test input: 3, 5, 6, 0, 0
output: 3, 5, 6, 0, 0

test input: 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
output: 0, 5, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

2, 0, 0, 7, 8
2, 2, 1, 1, 0
0, 5, 6, 6, 0
3, 5, 6, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0
