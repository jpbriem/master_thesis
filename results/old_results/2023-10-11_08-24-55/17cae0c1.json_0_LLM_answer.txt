LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input grid is repeated three times, with the middle value being replaced by a different value each time. The output for each row is the same regardless of the repetition.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a new grid by repeating each row of the input three times, with the middle value being replaced by a different value each time. The resulting grid would look like this:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
The output for this grid would be the same as the original test input, which is:
```
4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3
```
Therefore, the test output would be:
```
4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3
```
