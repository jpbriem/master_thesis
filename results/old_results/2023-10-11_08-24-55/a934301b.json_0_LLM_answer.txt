LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input corresponds to a specific digit in the output, with the same digit always being replaced by the same corresponding digit.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

* 0 becomes 0
* 1 becomes 1
* 8 becomes 8
* 1 becomes 1
* 1 becomes 1
* 0 becomes 0
* 0 becomes 0
* 1 becomes 1
* 1 becomes 1
* 1 becomes 1
* 1 becomes 1
* 0 becomes 0
* 0 becomes 0
* 0 becomes 0
* 0 becomes 0
* 0 becomes 0
