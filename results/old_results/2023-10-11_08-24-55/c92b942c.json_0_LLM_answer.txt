LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shifted grid relative to the original grid.

The first transformation shifts the grid three positions to the right (i.e., adding 3 to each value's position), and then sets the value at position (0,0) to 3, and sets the value at position (1,1) to 6.

The second transformation shifts the grid four positions up and one position left (i.e., adding 4 to each value's row index and subtracting 1 from each value's column index), and then sets the value at position (0,0) to 1, and sets the value at position (1,1) to 5.

The third transformation shifts the grid three positions down and two positions right (i.e., subtracting 3 from each value's row index and adding 2 to each value's column index), and then sets the value at position (0,0) to 4, and sets the value at position (1,1) to 1.

Therefore, to solve the test input, we need to apply these transformations in sequence. First, we shift the grid three positions to the right, setting the value at position (0,0) to 3, and the value at position (1,1) to 6. Then, we shift the grid four positions up and one position left, setting the value at position (0,0) to 1, and the value at position (1,1) to 5. Finally, we shift the grid three positions down and two positions right, setting the value at position (0,0) to 4, and the value at position (1,1) to 1.

The resulting test output would be:

2 -> 3
0 -> 6
0 -> 1
0 -> 5
0 -> 4
0 -> 1
