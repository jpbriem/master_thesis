LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple rotation of the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can rotate the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the test output. Here's the rotated version of the test input:

5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The resulting test output would be:

5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that the values in the output grid are the same as those in the input grid, but the positions have been swapped due to the 90-degree rotation.
