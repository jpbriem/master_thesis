LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be that each row of the input grid contains a sequence of digits that are either all equal or all different. The corresponding output for each row is the maximum value among the unique digits in that row.

For example, in the first train input, the first row has four consecutive equal digits (0), followed by two non-equal digits (2), then four more equal digits (0 again). Therefore, the output for this row is 6, which is the maximum value among the unique digits (0, 2). Similarly, the second row has three consecutive equal digits (0), followed by three non-equal digits (2, 2, 0), so the output for this row is also 6.

In the second train input, the first row has three consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then three more equal digits (0 again). Therefore, the output for this row is 4. The second row has three consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then three more equal digits (0 again), so the output for this row is also 4.

In the third train input, the first row has three consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (3), then five consecutive equal digits (0). Therefore, the output for this row is 5. The second row has three consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (3), then five consecutive equal digits (0 again), so the output for this row is also 5.

Based on this pattern, we can predict the output for the test input as follows:

1. First row: Four consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (3), then five consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 5.
2. Second row: Three consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (9), then seven consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 9.
3. Third row: Nine consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then four consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 4.
4. Fourth row: Four consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then four consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 4.
5. Fifth row: Five consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (3), then five consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 3.
6. Sixth row: Four consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then four consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 4.
7. Seventh row: Eight consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then eight consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 4.
8. Eighth row: Seven consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (3), then seven consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 3.
9. Ninth row: Ten consecutive equal digits (0), followed by a single non-equal digit (4), then ten consecutive equal digits (0). Output: 4.

Therefore, the predicted test output is:

5, 9, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3
