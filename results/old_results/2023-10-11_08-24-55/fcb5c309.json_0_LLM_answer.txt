LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the value of each cell is either 0 or 2 (or sometimes 3), and the values are always increasing from left to right. Additionally, there are certain "special" cells that have a value of 8, which seem to be acting as some kind of marker or signal.

Using this information, we can try to predict the output for the given test input. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. Start by examining the first row of the test input. It contains the values 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0. Since all the values are 0, we can infer that this row is "empty" and doesn't contain any useful information. Therefore, we can ignore it and move on to the next row.
2. The second row contains the values 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is similar to the first row, but it has a single 1 in the fifth position. We can interpret this 1 as a "signal" that tells us to pay attention to the next row.
3. The third row contains the values 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is interesting because it contains both 1 and 8, which suggests that it might be a "data" row that contains actual information. Let's examine it more closely.
4. The fourth row contains the values 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is similar to the third row, but it has a few more 0s and no 8s. We can infer that this row is also "data" and contains additional information.
5. The fifth row contains the values 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is similar to the previous two rows, but it has even more 0s and no 8s. We can conclude that this row is also "data" and contains further information.
6. The sixth row contains the values 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is similar to the previous three rows, but it has only a single 1 in the fifth position. We can infer that this row is "data" and contains additional information.
7. The seventh row contains the values 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is identical to the fifth row, which suggests that it might be a duplicate or redundant row. We can safely ignore it and move on to the next row.
8. The eighth row contains the values 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is similar to the previous four rows, but it has only a single 1 in the fifth position. We can infer that this row is "data" and contains additional information.
9. The ninth row contains the values 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. This row is identical to the third row, which suggests that it might be a duplicate or redundant row. We can safely ignore it and move on to the next row.
10. The tenth row contains the values 1,
