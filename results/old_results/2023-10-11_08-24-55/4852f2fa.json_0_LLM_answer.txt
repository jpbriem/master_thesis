LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern for generating the output for a given input appears to be:

1. Take the first two elements of the input row (from left to right).
2. If both elements are equal, copy the second element to the output row.
3. Otherwise, if the first element is zero, copy the second element to the output row, otherwise, copy the first element to the output row.
4. Shift the input row by one element to the right and repeat steps 1-3 until the end of the input row is reached.
5. Output the resulting row.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output for the given test input as follows:

test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0

First two elements are 0 and 0, so copy the second element (0) to the output row.
Output so far: 0

Shift the input row by one element to the right: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0

First two elements are still 0 and 0, so copy the second element (0) to the output row.
Output so far: 0, 0

Shift the input row by one element to the right: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8

First element is 0, and second element is 8, so copy the first element (0) to the output row.
Output so far: 0, 0, 0

Shift the input row by one element to the right: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8

First element is 0, and second element is 8, so copy the first element (0) to the output row.
Output so far: 0, 0, 0, 0

Shift the input row by one element to the right: 0, 0, 0, 0

First element is 0, and second element is 0, so copy the second element (0) to the output row.
Output so far: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The resulting test output is: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0

Note that this pattern generates the same output for the last four input rows, even though they have different values. It's possible that there may be other patterns that produce different outputs for these input rows, but based on the provided training data, this seems to be the most likely pattern.
