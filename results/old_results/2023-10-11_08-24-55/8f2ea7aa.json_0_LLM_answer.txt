LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right (i.e., add 1 to each element in the first column).
2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the result by one position to the left (i.e., subtract 1 from each element in the last column).
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a total of three iterations.
5. After the third iteration, shift the result by one position to the right again (i.e., add 1 to each element in the first column).
6. Finally, apply a logical NOT operation to the resulting grid to obtain the output.

Using this pattern, we can now compute the test output as follows:

1. Shift the test input by one position to the right:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

3. Shift the result by one position to the left:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a total of three iterations:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

5. After the third iteration, shift the result by one position to the right again:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
