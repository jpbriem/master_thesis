LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and a mask consisting of a 3x3 matrix of ones and zeros. The goal seems to be to find the correct sequence of transformations to apply to the input grid in order to produce a specified output grid.

Here's a summary of the patterns observed in the training data:

* Train Input #1: No transformation is applied to the input grid.
* Train Output #1: The output grid has a single 1 in the center cell, surrounded by 0s.
* Train Input #2: The input grid is shifted horizontally by 2 positions, and then the upper-left 2x2 sub-grid is filled with 1s.
* Train Output #2: The output grid has a 2x2 sub-grid of 1s in the upper-left corner, surrounded by 0s.
* Train Input #3: The input grid is shifted vertically by 2 positions, and then the left half of the grid is filled with 1s.
* Train Output #3: The output grid has a 1 in every other cell in the left half of the grid, surrounded by 0s.
* Train Input #4: The input grid is shifted diagonally by 2 positions, and then the upper-right 2x2 sub-grid is filled with 1s.
* Train Output #4: The output grid has a 2x2 sub-grid of 1s in the upper-right corner, surrounded by 0s.

Based on these observations, it seems likely that the test input is intended to be transformed using a combination of these patterns. Specifically, it looks like the test input should be transformed by shifting it horizontally by 2 positions, filling the upper-left 2x2 sub-grid with 1s, and then shifting it vertically by 2 positions and filling the left half of the grid with 1s. This would result in a output grid with a 2x2 sub-grid of 1s in the upper-left corner, a 1 in every other cell in the left half of the grid, and 0s everywhere else.

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
