[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is either a copy of the corresponding cell in the input grid, or a copy of a neighboring cell in the input grid that has a value of 3.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. For each row of the input grid, if the first cell has a value of 3, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will have a value of 8. Otherwise, it will have a value of 0.
2. For each row of the input grid, if the last cell has a value of 3, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will have a value of 8. Otherwise, it will have a value of 0.
3. For each row of the input grid, if there are exactly two cells with a value of 3, then the cell between them (if it exists) will have a value of 8 in the output grid. Otherwise, it will have a value of 0.
4. For each row of the input grid, if there are exactly three cells with a value of 3, then the middle cell (if it exists) will have a value of 8 in the output grid. Otherwise, it will have a value of 0.

Based on this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to create a complete grid:

test input:
3, 0, 3, 0, 3
3, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 3
0, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0

The completed grid would look like this:

completed input:
3, 0, 3, 0, 3
3, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 3
0, 3, 3, 0, 0
0, 3, 3, 0, 0

Now we can apply the pattern to the completed input to get the test output:

test output:
8, 0, 8, 0, 3
8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 3
0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

8, 0, 8, 0, 3
8, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 3
0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0
