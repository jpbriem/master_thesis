LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each row of the input grid is transformed into the corresponding row of the output grid through a series of substitutions.

The substitutions seem to be based on the values in the input grid, with certain values being replaced by other values. For example, in the first train input, the value 3 in the first row is replaced by the value 8 in the first row of the output grid. Similarly, in the second train input, the value 5 in the third row is replaced by the value 3 in the third row of the output grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can simply perform the same substitutions on each row of the test input to obtain the corresponding rows of the test output. Here's how the substitutions would work for each row of the test input:

1. 0 -> 0
2. 2 -> 0
3. 0 -> 0
4. 0 -> 0
5. 2 -> 0
6. 0 -> 0
7. 3 -> 8
8. 2 -> 0
9. 0 -> 0

Using these substitutions, we can transform the test input into the test output:

test input:
0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
