LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. The first transformation shifts the grid by one position to the right (i.e., adding 1 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
2. The second transformation shifts the grid by two positions to the right (i.e., adding 2 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. The third transformation shifts the grid by three positions to the right (i.e., adding 3 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
4. The fourth transformation shifts the grid by four positions to the right (i.e., adding 4 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
5. The fifth transformation shifts the grid by five positions to the right (i.e., adding 5 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
6. The sixth transformation shifts the grid by six positions to the right (i.e., adding 6 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
7. The seventh transformation shifts the grid by seven positions to the right (i.e., adding 7 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
8. The eighth transformation shifts the grid by eight positions to the right (i.e., adding 8 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
9. The ninth transformation shifts the grid by nine positions to the right (i.e., adding 9 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
10. The tenth transformation shifts the grid by ten positions to the right (i.e., adding 10 to each element's x-coordinate), and applies a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Based on this pattern, we can predict the output for the test input as follows:

1. Shift the test input grid by one position to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
2. Shift the result of step 1 by two positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the result of step 2 by three positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
4. Shift the result of step 3 by four positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
5. Shift the result of step 4 by five positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
6. Shift the result of step 5 by six positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
7. Shift the result of step 6 by seven positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
8. Shift the result of step 7 by eight positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
9. Shift the result of step 8 by nine positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
10. Shift the result of step 9 by ten positions to the right, and apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

The resulting output grid will be the final answer.
