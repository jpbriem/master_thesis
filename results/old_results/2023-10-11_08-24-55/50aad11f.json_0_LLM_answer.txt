LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that for each row, the value of each cell is determined by the number of cells in the previous row that have a value greater than or equal to the current cell's value. In particular, it seems that the value of each cell is equal to the number of such cells in the previous row, modulo 10.

Therefore, to determine the value of each cell in the test input, we can apply this pattern by looking at the previous row and counting the number of cells that have a value greater than or equal to the current cell's value.

Here's how the pattern would be applied to the test input:

* For the first row, there are no previous rows to consider, so we'll just use the values directly.
* For the second row, we look at the first row and see that there are two cells with values greater than or equal to 6 (the value of the second cell in the second row). Therefore, the value of the second cell in the second row would be 2 (modulo 10).
* For the third row, we look at the second row and see that there are three cells with values greater than or equal to 6 (the value of the third cell in the third row). Therefore, the value of the third cell in the third row would be 3 (modulo 10).
* And so on...

Using this pattern, we can calculate the values for each cell in the test input as follows:

* First row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Second row: 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Third row: 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Fourth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Fifth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Sixth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Seventh row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Eighth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Ninth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
* Tenth row: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output would be:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
