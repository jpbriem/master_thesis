LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid.

To apply this pattern to the final test input, we can perform the following steps:

1. Start with an empty output grid that is the same size as the input grid.
2. For each row of the input grid, starting from the leftmost column, copy the value of each cell into the corresponding cell in the output grid, shifting the values one position to the right for each row.
3. Repeat step 2 for each row of the input grid, until all rows have been processed.

Using this method, we can transform the test input into the test output as follows:

Test Input:
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0

Test Output:
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0
