LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be consistent across all the training examples.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the grid horizontally by 2 positions to the right.
2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the grid vertically by 2 positions down.
4. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
5. Shift the grid diagonally by 2 positions down and to the right.
6. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 two more times.

The resulting grid will have the same dimensions as the original grid, but with different values. The values in the resulting grid will be either 0 or 2, depending on whether the corresponding value in the original grid was 0 or non-zero.

Applying this pattern to the test input should give us the test output. Here's the test output based on the provided test input:

2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2
2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0
0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
