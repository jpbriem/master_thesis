LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a modification to the values in the grid based on the position of the shifted grid.

The first transformation shifts the grid by (0, 0) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 0.
The second transformation shifts the grid by (1, 0) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 1.
The third transformation shifts the grid by (1, 1) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 2.
The fourth transformation shifts the grid by (0, -1) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 3.
The fifth transformation shifts the grid by (-1, -1) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 4.
The sixth transformation shifts the grid by (-1, 0) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 5.
The seventh transformation shifts the grid by (-1, 1) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 6.
The eighth transformation shifts the grid by (0, 1) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 7.
The ninth transformation shifts the grid by (1, 1) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 8.
The tenth transformation shifts the grid by (1, 0) positions, and sets the value of the top-left cell to 9.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:
