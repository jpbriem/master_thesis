LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern being used is a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 8s, with an occasional 2 or 4 thrown in. It seems that the output for each row is simply a reflection of the number of 0s in that row, with the following modifications:

* If there are an odd number of 0s in the row, the output is 0.
* If there are an even number of 0s in the row, the output is 8.
* If there are exactly two 0s in the row, the output is 2.
* If there are exactly four 0s in the row, the output is 4.

Using this pattern, we can generate the test output as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

test output:
0

Can you please provide more information or clarify what you want me to do?
