LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a row of zeros with a row of a specific value (either 2, 3, or 1). The transformations are applied in a particular order, which is not explicitly specified but can be inferred from the training data.

The first transformation replaces the first row of zeros with a row of 2.
The second transformation replaces the second row of zeros with a row of 3.
The third transformation replaces the third row of zeros with a row of 1.
The fourth transformation replaces the fourth row of zeros with a row of 2.
The fifth transformation replaces the fifth row of zeros with a row of 3.
The sixth transformation replaces the sixth row of zeros with a row of 1.
The seventh transformation replaces the seventh row of zeros with a row of 2.
The eighth transformation replaces the eighth row of zeros with a row of 3.

Therefore, to obtain the test output, we need to apply these transformations to the test input grid. Here's how the transformations would be applied:

1. Replace the first row of zeros with a row of 2:
0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2. Replace the second row of zeros with a row of 3:
2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
3. Replace the third row of zeros with a row of 1:
2, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
4. Replace the fourth row of zeros with a row of 2:
2, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
5. Replace the fifth row of zeros with a row of 3:
2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6. Replace the sixth row of zeros with a row of 1:
2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
7. Replace the seventh row of zeros with a row of 2:
2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0
8. Replace the eighth row of zeros with a row of 3:
2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0 becomes 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0

Now, let's apply these transformations to the test input grid:

0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
