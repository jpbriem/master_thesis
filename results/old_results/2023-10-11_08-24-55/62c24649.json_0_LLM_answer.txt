[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that the output value at position (i, j) is equal to the minimum of the values at positions (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), and (i+1, j).

Here's an example of how this pattern would work for the first row of the test input:

* The output value at position (1, 1) would be the minimum of the values at positions (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1), which are all equal to 0. Therefore, the output value at position (1, 1) would be 0.
* The output value at position (1, 2) would be the minimum of the values at positions (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 2), which are all equal to 0. Therefore, the output value at position (1, 2) would be 0.
* The output value at position (1, 3) would be the minimum of the values at positions (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3), which are all equal to 0. Therefore, the output value at position (1, 3) would be 0.

Applying this pattern to the entire test input, we get the following output:

test output:
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
