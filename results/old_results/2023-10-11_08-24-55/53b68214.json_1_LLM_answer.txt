LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves filling in the missing values in the input grid with the value of the top-left corner (row 1, column 1) repeated three times.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Note that this is just one possible solution based on the given training data. If there are multiple possible solutions or ambiguities in the input data, it may be necessary to clarify the exact requirements of the problem or provide additional information to determine the correct solution.
