LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each row of the input grid is transformed into a corresponding row of the output grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can transform each row of the test input into a corresponding row of the test output, using the same rules that were applied to the train input and output pairs.

Here's one possible way to apply the pattern to the test input:

test input:
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 1, 0, 9, 1, 1, 1
9, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0
9, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
1, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9
9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9

test output:
0, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0
0, 3, 6, 4, 4, 6, 3, 0
3, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6, 0, 3
0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
3, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6, 0, 3
0, 3, 6, 4, 4, 6, 3, 0
0, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 0

Note that the test output is not necessarily unique, as there may be multiple ways to apply the pattern to the test input.
