LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of replacing a row of zeros with a copy of a different row. Specifically:

* The first transformation replaces the first row with a copy of the third row.
* The second transformation replaces the second row with a copy of the fourth row.
* The third transformation replaces the third row with a copy of the fifth row.
* The fourth transformation replaces the fourth row with a copy of the sixth row.
* The fifth transformation replaces the fifth row with a copy of the seventh row (or the last row, if there are fewer than seven rows).

Applying this pattern to the test input, we get:

test output:
7, 7, 7, 7, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 7, 0, 0

Note that the last row of the test output is not fully defined, since there are only six rows in the test input. In general, the last row of the output would be a copy of the last row of the input, but since there are no rows after the sixth row, the last row of the output would be blank.
