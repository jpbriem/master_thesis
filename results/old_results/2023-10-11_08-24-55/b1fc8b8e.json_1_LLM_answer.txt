LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is transformed independently. The transformation involves replacing certain elements with their complement (i.e., 8 - element), while leaving others unchanged.

Here's a summary of the transformations applied to each row of the input grid:

1. Row 1: No transformation.
2. Row 2: Replace elements 0 and 8 with their complements (i.e., 8 and 0, respectively).
3. Row 3: Replace elements 0, 8, and 16 (if present) with their complements.
4. Row 4: No transformation.
5. Row 5: Replace elements 0 and 8 with their complements.
6. Row 6: No transformation.

Applying this pattern to the test input yields the following test output:

test output:
0, 8, 0, 0, 8
8, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 0, 8
8, 8, 0, 8, 8
End of example.
