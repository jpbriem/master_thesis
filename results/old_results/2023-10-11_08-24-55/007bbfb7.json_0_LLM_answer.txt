LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some elements possibly being modified or removed based on their value. Specifically:

* If an element in the input is 0, it is copied to the output unchanged.
* If an element in the input is 7, it is changed to 0 in the output.
* If two elements in the input are both 7, they are replaced by a single 0 in the output.

Using this pattern, we can now predict the output for the test input:

test input:
7, 0, 7
7, 0, 7
7, 7, 0

test output:
7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7
7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7
7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7

Note that the last three elements of each row in the test input are not used in the prediction, since they do not affect the output.
