[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each digit in the input row is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output row, based on the following mapping:

0 -> 4
3 -> 3
5 -> 5

Here's how this mapping works for each train input and output pair:

1. train input: 0, 3, 3, 3
train output: 0, 4, 4, 4

The first digit '0' in the input row is replaced by '4' in the output row. The second and third digits '3' in the input row are also replaced by '4' in the output row.

2. train input: 3, 3, 0, 3
train output: 4, 4, 0, 4

The first and third digits '3' in the input row are replaced by '4' in the output row. The second digit '0' in the input row is replaced by '0' in the output row.

3. train input: 0, 0, 0, 0
train output: 0, 0, 0, 0

All four digits in the input row are replaced by '0' in the output row.

4. train input: 0, 0, 0, 3
train output: 0, 0, 0, 4

The fourth digit '3' in the input row is replaced by '4' in the output row.

5. train input: 5, 0, 5, 0
train output: 5, 0, 5, 0

The first and third digits '5' in the input row are replaced by '5' in the output row. The second and fourth digits '0' in the input row are replaced by '0' in the output row.

6. train input: 3, 3, 0, 3
train output: 4, 4, 0, 4

The first and third digits '3' in the input row are replaced by '4' in the output row. The second digit '0' in the input row is replaced by '0' in the output row.

7. train input: 0, 3, 3, 3
train output: 0, 4, 4, 4

The first digit '0' in the input row is replaced by '0' in the output row. The second and third digits '3' in the input row are replaced by '4' in the output row.

8. train input: 5, 5, 5, 5
train output: 5, 5, 5, 5

All four digits in the input row are replaced by '5' in the output row.

9. train input: 5, 0, 0, 5
train output: 5, 0, 0, 5

The first and fourth digits '5' in the input row are replaced by '5' in the output row. The second and third digits '0' in the input row are replaced by '0' in the output row.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that the test output for the given test input should be:

test input: 3, 3, 0, 3
test output: 4, 4, 0, 4

Can you please provide me with more information or clarify what else I can help you with?
