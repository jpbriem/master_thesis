[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid. The transformations are applied in a particular order, which seems to be consistent across all the training examples.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. First, the input grid is shifted horizontally by 3 positions to the right (i.e., the first 3 columns are copied to the last 3 columns).
2. Next, the grid is shifted vertically by 3 positions downward (i.e., the first 3 rows are copied to the last 3 rows).
3. After that, the grid is shifted diagonally by 3 positions in a southeasterly direction (i.e., the top-left corner is moved 3 positions to the bottom-right corner).
4. Another diagonal shift occurs, this time 3 positions in a southwesterly direction (i.e., the top-right corner moves 3 positions to the bottom-left corner).
5. A fifth transformation involves shifting the grid horizontally by 3 positions to the left (i.e., the last 3 columns are copied to the first 3 columns).
6. Finally, the grid is shifted vertically by 3 positions upward (i.e., the last 3 rows are copied to the first 3 rows).

The resulting grid is then the output.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7
0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6
6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0
6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern to the test input yields the following output:

test output:
6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7
0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0
0, 0, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6
6, 0, 0, 0, 6,
