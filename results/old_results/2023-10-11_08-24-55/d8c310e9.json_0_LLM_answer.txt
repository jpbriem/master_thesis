LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying the following operations to the input grid:

1. Replace every 0 with 2.
2. If there are two or more consecutive 2s horizontally or vertically, replace them with 0.
3. If there is a 2 in the top-left corner, replace it with 4.
4. If there is a 2 in the bottom-right corner, replace it with 6.
5. If there is a 3 in the middle row, replace it with 3.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input grid:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern:

1. Replace every 0 with 2:
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

2. If there are two or more consecutive 2s horizontally or vertically, replace them with 0:
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

3. If there is a 2 in the top-left corner, replace it with 4:
0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
6, 2, 2, 0, 6,
