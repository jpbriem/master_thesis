LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern being used is that every eighth element in the input array is set to 8, and the rest are set to 0. The output for each row is the number of 8's in that row, followed by the number of 0's in that row.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

The output for the test input would be:
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Please note that this is just one possible way to interpret the pattern, and there could be other ways to read the output as well.
