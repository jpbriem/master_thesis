LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the given training data, it appears that the pattern involves filling in missing values in a 2D grid with values from 0 to 9. The goal is to find the value that should be placed in the bottom-right corner of the grid (represented by a "?" in the input).

To solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the patterns in each row and column of the grid. We can see that each row and column has a specific sequence of values that repeat themselves. For example, in the first row, the sequence is "0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0", while in the second row, it's "0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0". Similarly, in the first column, the sequence is "0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0", while in the second column, it's "0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0".

Based on these observations, we can deduce a general pattern for filling in missing values in the grid. Specifically, we can fill in the missing values in each row and column using the same sequence of values that appears in that row and column.

Using this approach, we can fill in the missing values in the test input as follows:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0
0, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0

Applying the pattern to the test input, we get the following solution:

test output:
5
