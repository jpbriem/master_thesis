LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid, where each row is transformed into its corresponding output row through a series of element-wise operations.

The specific operations that seem to be performed on each row of the input grid are:

1. A cyclic shift of the elements in the row by some number of positions (wrapping around at the end of the row).
2. An XOR operation between adjacent elements in the row (i.e., flipping the bits of alternate elements).
3. A permutation of the elements in the row, which seems to be a random shuffling of the elements.

Based on these observations, we can try to apply these operations to the test input grid to obtain the test output grid. Here's how the operations would be applied:

1. Cyclic shift: Shift the elements in each row by a certain number of positions (wrapping around at the end of the row). For example, if the shift value is 3, then the first three elements of the first row would become the last three elements of the second row, and so on.
2. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between adjacent elements in each row. This will flip the bits of alternate elements in each row.
3. Permutation: Randomly permute the elements in each row. This can be done by randomly swapping pairs of elements in each row.

Here's how the test input grid would look after applying these operations:
```
2, 8, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1
4, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 4
1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 7, 3
1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3
4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 8, 4
3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4
1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4
```
Now, let's apply the same operations to the test input grid to obtain the test output grid:

1. Cyclic shift: Shift the elements in each row by a certain number of positions (wrapping around at the end of the row).
2. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between adjacent elements in each row.
3. Permutation: Randomly permute the elements in each row.

After applying these operations, the test output grid would look like this:
```
7, 3, 8, 4, 3, 2, 8
4, 8, 7, 4, 4, 8, 2
1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 7
1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 3
4, 1, 1, 1, 7, 8, 4
3, 2, 8, 4, 1, 8, 4
1, 4, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4
```
This is the predicted test output grid based on the patterns observed in the train inputs and outputs.
