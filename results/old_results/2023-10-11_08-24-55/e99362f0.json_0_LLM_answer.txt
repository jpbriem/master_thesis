LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves comparing elements in the input grid and applying certain transformations to create the corresponding output. Here's a summary of the steps involved in the pattern:

1. Compare elements in the input grid:
	* Compare elements in the same row. If two elements in the same row have the same value, then the output for that row will have the same value as well.
	* Compare elements in adjacent columns. If two elements in adjacent columns have the same value, then the output for that column will have the same value as well.
2. Apply transformations:
	* If an element in the input grid has a value of 0, then the corresponding element in the output grid will have a value of 0.
	* If an element in the input grid has a value of 7, then the corresponding element in the output grid will have a value of 8.
	* If an element in the input grid has a value of 9, then the corresponding element in the output grid will have a value of 9.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row and column in the input grid until the entire output grid has been filled.

Using this pattern, we can now fill in the missing values in the test input to get the test output:

test input:
7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 9, 0
7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 9
0, 7, 7, 0, 4, 9, 9, 9, 9
7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 9, 0, 9, 9
7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 9, 9, 0, 9
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
2, 2, 0, 2, 4, 8, 8, 0, 8
0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 8, 8, 8, 0
test output:
7, 7, 8, 8
7, 8, 8, 7
8, 9, 9, 8
8, 8, 7, 7
8, 8, 8, 7
4, 4, 4, 4
2, 2, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 2

Note that the test output is not a direct copy of the training output, but rather a transformed version of it based on the pattern identified from the training data.
