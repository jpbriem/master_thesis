LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output, with some elements possibly being modified or removed. Specifically:

* The first element of each row is copied to the first element of the corresponding row in the output.
* The second element of each row is copied to the second element of the corresponding row in the output, but if it is equal to the first element, it is changed to zero.
* The third element of each row is copied to the third element of the corresponding row in the output, but if it is equal to the first or second element, it is changed to zero.
* Any remaining elements in the row are set to zero.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to create a complete 3x3 grid:

test input:
6, 6, 0
6, 6, 0
0, 0, 6

The completed grid would look like this:

6, 6, 0
6, 6, 0
0, 0, 6

Applying the pattern to the completed grid gives us the test output:

6, 6, 0
6, 6, 0
0, 0, 6
