LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple transformation of the input grid into the output grid, where each cell in the output grid is determined by the values of the corresponding cells in the input grid. Specifically, it seems that each cell in the output grid is equal to the number of cells in the input grid that have a value greater than or equal to the value of the cell in the output grid.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can create a grid with the same dimensions as the test input, and fill it with values based on the rules above. Here's how the test output would look like:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

In this output, each cell has a value of 0, except for the bottom-left corner, which has a value of 3, and the top-right corner, which has a value of 2. These values correspond to the only non-zero cells in the test input.
