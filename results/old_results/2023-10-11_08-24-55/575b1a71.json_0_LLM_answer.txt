LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

test output:[/INST]
################################################################

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves counting the number of 5's in each row and then applying a specific operation based on that count.

For the first two examples, the pattern is:

* If there are 5 5's in a row, the output is 5.
* If there are 4 5's in a row, the output is 1.
* If there are 3 5's in a row, the output is 2.
* If there are 2 5's in a row, the output is 3.
* If there are 1 5's in a row, the output is 5.

The third example introduces a new element, 0, which seems to play a role in the pattern.

Based on the training data, the pattern for the third example appears to be:

* If there are 5 5's in a row, the output is 5.
* If there are 4 5's and 1 0 in a row, the output is 1.
* If there are 3 5's and 2 0's in a row, the output is 2.
* If there are 2 5's and 3 0's in a row, the output is 3.
* If there are 1 5's and 4 0's in a row, the output is 4.

Given this information, we can now apply these patterns to the test input to obtain the test output:

Test Input:
5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5

Applying the pattern from the first two examples:

* The first row has 5 5's, so the output is 5.
* The second row has 4 5's and 1 0, so the output is 1.
* The third row has 3 5's and 2 0's, so the output is 2.
* The fourth row has 2 5's and 3 0's, so the output is 3.
* The fifth row has 1 5's and 4 0's, so the output is 4.

Applying the pattern from the third example:

* The sixth row has 5 5's, so the output is 5.
* The seventh row has 4 5's and 1 0, so the output is 1.
* The eighth row has 3 5's and 2 0's, so the output is 2.

Therefore, the test output would be:
5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2
