LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves applying a series of transformations to the input grid, where each transformation consists of shifting the grid by some number of positions in a specific direction (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and then applying a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.

Here's a more detailed description of the pattern:

1. Shift the input grid by one position to the right (i.e., add 1 to each element's index).
2. Apply a logical AND operation to the shifted grid and the original grid.
3. Shift the result by one position to the left (i.e., subtract 1 from each element's index).
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the desired number of iterations has been reached.

The number of iterations is determined by the value of the top-left element of the input grid. Specifically, if the top-left element is equal to 1, then repeat the process 2 times; if it's equal to 2, then repeat the process 3 times; and so on.

Applying this pattern to the test input yields the following output:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0

Note that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but with the elements arranged differently due to the shifts and logical operations performed during the pattern application.
