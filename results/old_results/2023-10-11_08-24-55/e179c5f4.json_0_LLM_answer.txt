LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple rotation of the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise, followed by a reflection along the diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by rotating the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0

Next, we can reflect the rotated grid along the diagonal:

8, 1, 8, 8, 1
1, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 1, 8, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 8, 1, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 1, 8, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
1, 8, 8, 8, 8

Therefore, the test output would be:

8, 1, 8, 8, 1
1, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 1, 8, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 8, 1, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
8, 8, 1, 8, 8
8, 1, 8, 8, 1
1, 8, 8, 8, 8
