LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is repeated a certain number of times, with some elements possibly being swapped or rearranged. The number of repeats seems to be determined by the number of elements in the row.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can break it down into rows:

Row 1: 6, 8, 6
Row 2: 8, 6, 8
Row 3: 1, 6, 1

We can then repeat each row the appropriate number of times to get the test output:

Test output:
6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6
8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8
1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1

Therefore, the test output would be:

6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6
8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8
1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1
