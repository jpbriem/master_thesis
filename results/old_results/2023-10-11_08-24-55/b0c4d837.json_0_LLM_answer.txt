LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern for generating the output is as follows:

1. Take the first five elements of the input row (starting from the left) and repeat them three times.
2. If the sixth element is greater than 5, replace it and the following two elements with 8, 8, 8.
3. Otherwise, leave the sixth element unchanged and fill the remaining two elements with 0.
4. For the last three elements of the row, repeat the pattern of the first five elements.

Therefore, the test output for the given test input would be:

8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
