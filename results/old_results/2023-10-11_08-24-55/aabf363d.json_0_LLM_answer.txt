LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train inputs and outputs appears to be a simple copying mechanism, where each value in the input is copied to a corresponding position in the output, with some modifications based on the value of the middle cell (column 3).

Here's a summary of the pattern:

1. If the value in column 3 is 0, the corresponding value in the output will be 0.
2. If the value in column 3 is not 0, the corresponding value in the output will be the same as the value in column 3.

Based on this pattern, we can fill in the missing values in the test input to create a complete 7x7 grid:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern to the complete grid, we get the following test output:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
