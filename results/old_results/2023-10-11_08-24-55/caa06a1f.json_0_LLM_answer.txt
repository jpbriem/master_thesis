[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, it appears that the pattern involves rotating the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise, then applying a series of transformations to each row, which includes shifting elements to the right by a certain number of positions, reversing the order of elements in some cases, and possibly applying additional modifications.

To explain this in more detail, let's consider the first two training examples:

Example 1:

Input: 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3
Output: 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7

In this case, we can observe the following operations being applied to the input grid:

1. Rotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Shift the elements in each row to the right by one position (wrapping around when necessary).
3. Reverse the order of elements in every other row.

Using these operations, we can generate the output grid as follows:

1. Rotate the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise:

6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3

Becomes:

3, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3

2. Shift elements in each row to the right by one position:

3, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3

Becomes:

7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3

3. Reverse the order of elements in every other row:

7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 3, 3, 3

Becomes:

6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 3, 3, 3

Therefore, the output for the first training example would be:

7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7

Example 2:

Input: 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1
Output: 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1

Here, we can see that the same operations are being applied to the input grid, but in a different order. Specifically:

1. Shift elements in each row to the right by one position (wrapping around when necessary).
2. Reverse the order of elements in every other row.
3. Rotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise.

Using these operations, we can generate the output grid as follows:

1. Shift elements in each row to the right by one position:

6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1

Becomes:

3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1

2. Reverse the order of elements in every other row:

3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1

Becomes:

6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 1

3. Rotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise:

6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 1

Becomes:

3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1

Therefore, the output for the second training example would be:

3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6, 1

Based on these observations, we can infer that the general pattern for generating the output grid involves applying the following operations to the input grid:

1. Rotate the grid by 9
