LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple mapping of the input values to output values based on their positions in the grid. The rules for this mapping can be summarized as follows:

1. If the value at position (i, j) is 0, then the output value at position (i, j) will also be 0.
2. If the value at position (i, j) is 1, then the output value at position (i, j) will be 3.
3. If the value at position (i, j) is 5, then the output value at position (i, j) will be 7.
4. If the value at position (i, j) is 7, then the output value at position (i, j) will be 3.
5. If the value at position (i, j) is 8, then the output value at position (i, j) will be 0.

Using these rules, we can now apply them to the test input to get the test output:

test input: 0, 5, 0, 1, 5, 5, 0, 5

Applying rule 1, the output for the first column would be 0, since all the values in that column are 0.

Applying rule 2, the output for the second column would be 3, since there is one 1 in that column.

Applying rule 3, the output for the third column would be 7, since there is one 5 in that column.

Applying rule 4, the output for the fourth column would be 3, since there is one 7 in that column.

Applying rule 5, the output for the fifth column would be 0, since all the values in that column are 5.

The resulting test output would be: 0, 3, 7, 3, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5

Therefore, the test output is:

0, 3, 7, 3, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5
