LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of 0s and 8s, with occasional appearances of 3s. There does not appear to be any complex logic or rule governing the placement of these digits.

Based on this observation, the test output for the given test input would likely be:

0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8
8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8
0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8
0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3
0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0

Note that this is just one possible realization of the pattern; there may be other valid ways to continue the sequence.
