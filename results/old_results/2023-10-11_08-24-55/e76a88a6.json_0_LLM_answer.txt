LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the train input and output pairs appears to be a simple alternating sequence of numbers. Each number is repeated five times, followed by a new number that is also repeated five times.

Therefore, the rule for generating the output from a given input is:

1. Start with the first number in the input.
2. Repeat the number five times.
3. Move to the next number in the input.
4. Repeat the next number five times.
5. Continue this process until the end of the input.

Using this rule, we can generate the test output from the test input as follows:

test input: 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Output: 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

The first number in the input is 0, which is repeated five times. The next number is 4, which is also repeated five times. The remaining numbers in the input are all 0, so they are repeated five times each as well. Therefore, the test output is simply a repetition of the input numbers.
