LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple substitution cipher. Each number in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding number in the output grid, based on the position of the number in the grid.

The first row of the input grid is substituted by the second row of the output grid, the second row of the input grid is substituted by the third row of the output grid, and so on.

Therefore, to get the test output, we can apply the same substitution pattern to the test input. Here's how it would look like:

test input:
6, 7, 7, 6
6, 7, 6, 7
7, 7, 7, 6
7, 6, 7, 6

substitution:
6 -> 2
7 -> 7

test output:
2, 7, 7, 2
2, 7, 6, 7
7, 7, 7, 2
7, 6, 7, 6

So, the test output would be:
2, 7, 7, 2
2, 7, 6, 7
7, 7, 7, 2
7, 6, 7, 6
