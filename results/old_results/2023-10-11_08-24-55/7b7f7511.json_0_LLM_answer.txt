LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that the output is a permutation of the input values, where each value is moved a certain number of positions to the right or left. Specifically, it seems that each input value is shifted either one or two positions to the right, and then the resulting sequence is rotated by some number of positions to the left.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can start by shifting each value one position to the right, so that the first value becomes the second value, the second value becomes the third value, and so on. This gives us:

5 -> 4
4 -> 5
5 -> 4
4 -> 5
6 -> 6
6 -> 4
2 -> 6
6 -> 2

Next, we need to rotate the sequence by some number of positions to the left. It's not entirely clear how to determine the correct rotation, but based on the training data, it seems that the rotation should be by two positions. So, we get:

4 -> 5
5 -> 4
4 -> 5
5 -> 4
6 -> 6
4 -> 2
6 -> 6
2 -> 6

Finally, we need to shift each value back one position to the left, so that the first value becomes the second value, the second value becomes the third value, and so on. This gives us:

4 -> 5
5 -> 4
4 -> 5
5 -> 4
6 -> 6
2 -> 6
6 -> 2

Therefore, the test output would be:

4, 5, 4
5, 4, 5
6, 6, 4
2, 6, 2
