LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Based on the provided training data, the pattern appears to be:

1. If the top-left corner is 8, the bottom-right corner is also 8.
2. If the top-left corner is 0, the bottom-right corner is 8.
3. If the top-left corner is 8 and the top-right corner is 0, the bottom-left corner is 8.
4. If the top-left corner is 8 and the bottom-left corner is 0, the top-right corner is 8.
5. If the top-left corner is 0 and the bottom-left corner is 8, the top-right corner is 8.
6. If the top-left corner is 8 and the top-right corner is 8, the bottom-left corner is 0.
7. If the top-left corner is 0 and the bottom-right corner is 8, the top-left corner is 8.
8. If the top-left corner is 8 and the bottom-right corner is 0, the top-left corner is 8.

Using this pattern, we can fill in the missing values for the test input:

8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8

The test output would be:

8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0
8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 8,
