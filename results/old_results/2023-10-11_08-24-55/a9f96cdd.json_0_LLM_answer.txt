LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is transformed into a corresponding row of the output, with the following rules:

1. If the first element of a row is non-zero, it becomes the second element of the corresponding output row.
2. If the second element of a row is non-zero, it becomes the third element of the corresponding output row.
3. If the third element of a row is non-zero, it becomes the fourth element of the corresponding output row.
4. If the fourth element of a row is non-zero, it becomes the fifth element of the corresponding output row.
5. Otherwise, all elements of the output row are zero.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input to obtain the test output:

test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Applying the pattern above, we get:

test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the test output is:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
