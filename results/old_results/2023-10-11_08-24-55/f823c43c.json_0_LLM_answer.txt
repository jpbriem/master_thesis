LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Sure! I'll do my best to solve this puzzle. Here's my reasoning:

The pattern in the train input and output is that each row and column has exactly one 8 (or 7) in it, and all other cells in that row or column have a value of 6 or less. Furthermore, there are no duplicate 8s (or 7s) in any row or column.

Based on this pattern, we can start by filling in the first row. Since there needs to be an 8 in every row, let's put an 8 in the first cell. Now, we need to fill in the rest of the row without violating the rule about having only one 8 per row. We can fill in the remaining cells with 6s and 7s such that no two adjacent cells have the same value. One possible way to do this is:

8 6 7 6 7 6 7 6 8

Next, we move on to the second row. Again, we need to find a way to include an 8 in the row while avoiding duplicates and ensuring that no two adjacent cells have the same value. Here's one possible solution:

7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8 7

We continue this process for the remaining rows, always making sure to include exactly one 8 per row and avoiding duplicates. Here's the complete grid with the 8s filled in:

8 6 7 6 7 6 7 6 8
7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8 7
6 7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8
7 6 7 8 6 7 6 8 7
6 7 6 7 8 6 7 6 8
7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8 7
6 7 7 6 7 8 6 8 7
7 6 7 7 6 7 6 8 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

Now, we need to fill in the remaining cells with 6s and 7s such that no two adjacent cells have the same value. One possible way to do this is:

8 6 7 6 7 6 7 6 8
7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8 7
6 7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8
7 6 7 8 6 7 6 8 7
6 7 6 7 8 6 7 6 8
7 8 6 7 6 7 6 8 7
6 7 7 6 7 8 6 8 7
7 6 7 7 6 7 6 8 7
7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

Voila! That's the solution to the puzzle.
