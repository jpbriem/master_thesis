LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be that each row of the input is transformed into a single value in the output. The transformation involves taking the leftmost non-zero value in the row and shifting it three positions to the right, filling in zeros to the left and right as needed. If there are no non-zero values in the row, the output for that row is zero.

To apply this pattern to the test input, we can transform each row separately.

Row 1: 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0
The leftmost non-zero value is 4, which is shifted three positions to the right, resulting in an output of 6.

Row 2: 0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 3
The leftmost non-zero value is 4, which is shifted three positions to the right, resulting in an output of 6.

Row 3: 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0
The leftmost non-zero value is 4, which is shifted three positions to the right, resulting in an output of 6.

Therefore, the test output would be:

6, 6, 6
