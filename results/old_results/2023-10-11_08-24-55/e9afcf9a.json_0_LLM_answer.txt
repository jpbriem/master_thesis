[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
train output:
3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9
9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3
End of example.
train input:
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
train output:
4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8
8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4
End of example.
test input:
6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2

LLM answer:
  The pattern in the training data appears to be a simple alternating sequence of digits. In each row, the first half of the digits is a repetition of the same number (either 3, 4, or 6), followed by the same number again, and then the second half of the digits is the same as the first half, but shifted by one position.

Therefore, the rule for generating the output from a given input can be described as follows:

1. Divide the input into two halves, the first half containing the first n/2 digits, and the second half containing the remaining n/2 digits, where n is the length of the input.
2. Repeat the first half of the digits in the output, starting from the beginning of the output.
3. Shift the second half of the digits in the output by one position to the right, so that the last digit of the first half becomes the first digit of the second half.
4. Repeat the second half of the digits in the output, starting from the end of the first half.

Applying this rule to the test input of 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 results in the following output:

6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2

The resulting output is the same as the test input, which suggests that the rule correctly generates the output for the given input.
