The given examples are in the format of (input, output) pairs, where the input is a sequence of 4 characters and the output is a single character. The task is to learn a mapping from the input sequences to the corresponding output characters.
In this case, it seems that the output character is determined by the majority vote of the last 3 characters of the input sequence. For example, if the last 3 characters of the input sequence are "a, a, a", then the output character is "i" (the first letter of the word "if"). If the last 3 characters are "a, a, b", then the output character is "b".
Therefore, one possible solution to this problem is to use a sliding window approach, where you maintain a window of size 3 over the input sequence, and at each step, you update the window by shifting it by 1 character to the right and adding the new character to the end. You can then use the majority vote of the characters in the window to determine the output character.
For example, on the first input sequence "a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a", the window would be initially empty, and you would add the first "a" to the window. Then, you would shift the window by 1 character to the right and add the second "a" to the window, making it "a, a". At this point, the majority vote of the characters in the window is "a", so the output character would be "i". You would continue this process for the rest of the input sequence, updating the window and computing the majority vote at each step.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
