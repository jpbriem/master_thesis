The task is to predict the next character in the sequence given the previous characters. The training data contains five examples with four input characters and one output character each. The test data contains one example with five input characters and no output character.

Can you please help me understand how this task can be solved using a recurrent neural network (RNN)? Specifically, I want to know how the RNN architecture would look like for this problem, what kind of activation function should be used, and how the training process would work?

I have tried solving this problem using an RNN architecture with a single layer containing 50 units, a ReLU activation function, and a softmax output layer. However, my model is not able to capture the patterns in the data correctly, and I am getting poor accuracy on the test set.

Please provide your answer in detail so that I can understand the concepts better.
Thanks!
