The training data contains 5 examples with 5 lines each. Each line in the training data represents a sequence of 5 characters. The first character in each line is the actual character, and the remaining 4 characters are the context characters. For example, in the first line of the training data, "c" is the actual character, and "h", "i", "i", and "i" are the context characters.

The goal is to predict the actual character based on the context characters. In this case, the model should learn to predict "c" given the context "h", "i", "i", and "i".

The test data contains 1 example with 4 lines. Each line in the test data represents a sequence of 5 characters, where the first character is the predicted character, and the remaining 4 characters are the context characters. The model's task is to predict the actual character based on the context characters.

For example, in the first line of the test data, the model should predict "i" as the actual character based on the context "i", "i", "e", and "f".
