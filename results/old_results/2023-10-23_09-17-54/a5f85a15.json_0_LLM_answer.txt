In this example, the model is trained on three examples of valid input and output pairs, where each example consists of a sequence of tokens (either 'a', 'j', or 'd') followed by a space and then another sequence of tokens. The model is then tested on a single example of invalid input, which contains a token ('g') that was not present in any of the training examples.

The first line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that does not contain the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'a'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'g', which is incorrect.

The second line of the test input is also a sequence of tokens that does not contain the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'a'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'a', which is correct.

The third line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that contains the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'g'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'a', which is incorrect.

The fourth line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that does not contain the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'a'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'g', which is incorrect.

The fifth line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that contains the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'g'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'a', which is incorrect.

The sixth line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that does not contain the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'a'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'g', which is incorrect.

The seventh line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that contains the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'g'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'a', which is incorrect.

The eighth line of the test input is a sequence of tokens that does not contain the token 'g'. Therefore, the model should predict the first token of the corresponding output sequence, which is 'a'. However, the actual output of the model for this input is 'g', which is incorrect.

The ninth line of the test input is a sequence
