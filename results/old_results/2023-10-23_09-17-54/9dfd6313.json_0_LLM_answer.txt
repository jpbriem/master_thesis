This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `neural_network` module in Python to create and train a neural network for function approximation. The notebook provides examples of how to define the network architecture, prepare the data for training, and train the network using different activation functions and optimization algorithms. It also includes tests to evaluate the performance of the trained network on new data.

The notebook first imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy and the `neural_network` module. It then defines a function called `prepare_data` that takes in a list of input-output pairs and returns a tuple containing the input and output arrays, with the inputs flattened into a 1D array and the outputs flattened into a 1D array or matrix, depending on the number of outputs.

The next section of the notebook provides several examples of how to create and train a neural network using the `neural_network` module. Each example consists of defining the network architecture, preparing the data for training, and training the network using a specific activation function and optimization algorithm. The examples demonstrate how to use different activation functions, such as sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh, and how to choose the number of hidden layers and hidden units in the network. They also show how to use different optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and Adam.

After the examples, the notebook provides some tests to evaluate the performance of the trained networks on new data. These tests demonstrate how to use the trained networks to make predictions on new input data and how to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

Overall, this notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to using the `neural_network` module in Python for function approximation. It covers the basic concepts of neural networks, such as activation functions and optimization algorithms, and shows how to apply them in practice.
