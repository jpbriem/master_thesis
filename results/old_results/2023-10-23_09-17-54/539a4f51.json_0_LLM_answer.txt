This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of RNNs being used for sequence prediction tasks. The first cell in the notebook provides some background information on RNNs and their applications, while the remaining cells contain examples of how to implement RNNs using Keras.

The second cell in the notebook provides an example of how to use an RNN to predict the next character in a sequence of text. The input data is provided as a list of sequences, where each sequence consists of a series of characters. The RNN is trained on this data and then used to make predictions on new, unseen sequences.

The third cell in the notebook provides another example of sequence prediction, but this time using a different type of RNN called a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs are a type of RNN that are particularly well-suited to tasks involving long sequences, as they have the ability to selectively forget or remember parts of the input data.

The fourth cell in the notebook demonstrates how to use an RNN to perform language modeling, which involves predicting the likelihood of a given word or character occurring in a sentence. This task requires the RNN to capture complex contextual relationships between words in a sentence.

Finally, the fifth cell in the notebook provides an example of how to use an RNN to generate text, rather than simply predicting the next character or word. This is done by training the RNN on a large corpus of text data and then using it to generate new sentences that are similar in style and structure to the training data.
