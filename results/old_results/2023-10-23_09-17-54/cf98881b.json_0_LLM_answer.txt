LLM answer:

?
\end{code}

This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of RNNs being used for sequence prediction tasks. The first cell in the notebook provides some background information on RNNs and how they can be used for sequence prediction. The remaining cells contain examples of different types of sequence prediction tasks, with input and output sequences provided for each task.

The first example is a simple sequence prediction task, where the goal is to predict the next element in a sequence based on the previous elements. The input sequence is `a, e, a, e` and the expected output sequence is `j, e, a`. The second example is similar, but with a slightly longer input sequence and a more complex output sequence.

The third example is a bit more challenging, as it involves predicting multiple elements in the output sequence. The input sequence is `e, e, e, e, c, j, a, j, a, c, a, a, a, b`, and the expected output sequence is `e, e, e, e`.

The fourth example is similar to the third, but with a different input sequence and output sequence. The fifth example is also similar, but with a slightly longer input sequence and a more complex output sequence.

The final cell in the notebook contains a test input sequence that the reader is encouraged to try on their own. The input sequence is `a, a, e, a, c, j, a, j, a, c, b, b, a, a`, and the expected output sequence is not provided. This allows the reader to practice using RNNs for sequence prediction on their own data.
