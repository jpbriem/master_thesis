The first line of the file contains the number of examples and the number of tests that follow. Each example consists of three tokens (a, f, or d) separated by spaces, representing the input to the function. The corresponding output is given on the next line, also consisting of three tokens separated by spaces.

Your task is to determine the rule that describes how the function maps inputs to outputs based on the given examples and then use this rule to predict the output for the given test cases.

Note that there may be multiple possible rules that can explain the given examples, and your job is to find one such rule. Also, note that the rule should be in English language, describing the mapping from input to output in a human-understandable way.

Input/Output format:

* Input: Three tokens (a, f, or d) separated by spaces.
* Output: Three tokens (a, f, or d) separated by spaces.

Constraints:

* Tokens are single characters 'a', 'f', or 'd'.
* There will be exactly three tokens in each input and output.
* There will be at least 1 and at most 4 examples.
* There will be at least 1 and at most 4 test cases.

Example 1:

Input: a, a, f
Output: d, d, d

Example 2:

Input: a, f, a
Output: e, e, e

Example 3:

Input: f, a, a
Output: c, c, c

Example 4:

Input: a, a, f
Output: d, d, d

Test case 1:

Input: a, f, a
Output:?,?,?

Test case 2:

Input: f, a, a
Output:?,?,?

Test case 3:

Input: a, f, a
Output:?,?,?

Solution:
d, d, d
c, c, c
e, e, e
