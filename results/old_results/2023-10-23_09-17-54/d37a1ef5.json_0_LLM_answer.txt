\end{code}

In this example, we have a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing 16 neurons, and an output layer with 2 neurons (one for each class). The model is trained on a dataset with 4 input features and 2 output classes. The training data consists of 9 examples, and the test data consists of 3 examples.

The first line of the file contains the number of inputs, outputs, and hidden units (16 in this case). The next 9 lines represent the training data, with each line corresponding to a single example. Each example consists of 4 input features, followed by a space, followed by the true output class (either "a" or "c").

The last line of the file contains the test data, which consists of 3 examples. The format of the test data is the same as the training data.

To use this file to train a neural network in Python using Keras, you can use the following code:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load the data from the file
with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = np.loadtxt(f, dtype=np.float32)

# Preprocess the data
X = data[:, :4]  # Input features
y = data[:, 4]  # Output class

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model on the training set
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test loss: {loss:.3f}, Test accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}')

# Use the model to make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```
This code defines a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing 16 neurons, and trains it on the training data using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. It then evaluates the model on the test data and makes predictions on new data.
