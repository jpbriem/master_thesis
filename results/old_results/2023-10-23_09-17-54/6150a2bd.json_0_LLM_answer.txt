LLM answer:

a, g, e
a, i, d
f, g, f
End of example.
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing three integers separated by spaces - representing the input for the corresponding test case. The next line contains an integer N denoting the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the neural network. Finally, the last line contains M integers separated by spaces, where M is the number of outputs from the neural network - these integers represent the expected output for each test case.
Note that there may be multiple valid solutions for the weights and biases of the neural network. You are free to choose any set of weights and biases that produce the correct output for all test cases.
Output format:
For each test case, print a single line containing the predicted output for that test case, separated by spaces. The predicted output should match the expected output for that test case.

Example Input:
4
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
10 11 12
2 3 4
5 6 7
8 9 10
11 12 13
Example Output:
4 5 6
7 8 9
10 11 12
1 2 3
Note:
In this problem, we're working with modular arithmetic, so all calculations should be performed taking modulus 10 into account. For example, if the result of a calculation is 12, it should be reduced to 2 (since 12 mod 10 = 2). Similarly, when comparing two numbers, they should be compared taking modulus 10 into account. For example, 8 is greater than 5 (since 8 - 5 = 3), but 5 is greater than 8 (since 5 - 8 = -3).
