LLM answer:

a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
\end{code}

The first line contains the number of examples (4) and the number of features (5). Each example is represented by a row of 5 values separated by commas. The last value in each row is the class label (either 'a' or 'd').

The second section of the file contains the training data. Each example is again represented by a row of 5 values separated by commas. The last value in each row is the class label.

The third section of the file contains the test data. It consists of 3 rows of 5 values separated by commas.

Your task is to develop a classifier that can predict the class label for the test data based on the training data. You may use any machine learning algorithm or combination of algorithms that you like. You may also preprocess the data in any way that you think will help improve performance. Good luck!
