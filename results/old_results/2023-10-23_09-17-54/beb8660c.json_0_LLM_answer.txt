The first line of the file contains the number of training examples, and the second line contains the number of testing examples. The following lines contain the input and output pairs for the training and testing sets, respectively. Each input is represented as a sequence of characters (a, b, c, etc.), and each output is represented as a sequence of characters as well.

Your task is to write a program that can solve this problem by generating a hypothesis (a function or a model) that can predict the output given a new input. You can use any programming language you like, and you can use any machine learning library or framework that is available in your chosen language.

You will be evaluated based on how well your hypothesis performs on the test set. Specifically, we will calculate the accuracy of your hypothesis on the test set, which is the proportion of correctly predicted outputs out of all outputs in the test set. We will also report the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced measure of both.

To make things more interesting, we have added some noise to the data. Some of the inputs and outputs have been randomly replaced with incorrect values. This is to simulate the real-world scenario where data is often noisy or incomplete. Your job is to identify the pattern in the data and come up with a hypothesis that can generalize well to new inputs.

Good luck!
