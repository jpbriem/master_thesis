The given problem is an example of a "next-step" problem, where the goal is to predict the next symbol in a sequence based on the previous symbols. The training data consists of pairs of input and output sequences, where each input sequence contains three symbols from a finite alphabet (in this case, {a, b, c, d, e, f}) and each output sequence contains three symbols from the same alphabet.

The problem can be solved using various machine learning algorithms, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The basic idea behind these algorithms is to learn a mapping from input sequences to output sequences by analyzing the patterns in the training data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions for new input sequences that were not seen during training.

To solve the problem, we need to first preprocess the data by tokenizing the input and output sequences into individual symbols. We can then represent each sequence as a vector of binary features, where each feature corresponds to the presence or absence of a particular symbol in the sequence. For example, if we have five symbols in our alphabet ({a, b, c, d, e}), we would have five binary features for each sequence:

* Feature 1: Is symbol "a" present in the sequence? (0/1)
* Feature 2: Is symbol "b" present in the sequence? (0/1)
* Feature 3: Is symbol "c" present in the sequence? (0/1)
* Feature 4: Is symbol "d" present in the sequence? (0/1)
* Feature 5: Is symbol "e" present in the sequence? (0/1)

We can then use a supervised learning algorithm, such as a RNN or LSTM, to learn a mapping from the input features to the output features. During training, the model is presented with the input sequences and their corresponding output sequences, and it adjusts its weights to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. Once the model is trained, we can use it to make predictions for new input sequences that were not seen during training.

For example, suppose we want to predict the output sequence for the input sequence "d, a, a". We would first tokenize the input sequence into individual symbols: "d", "a", "a". We would then represent the sequence as a vector of binary features: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (since symbol "d" is present in the sequence, but symbols "a" and "a" are not). We would then feed this vector into the trained model, which would produce a prediction for the output sequence. Based on the training data, the model might predict the output sequence "a, c, c" (since the pattern "d, a, a" is similar to the pattern "a, a, d" in the training data, which has the corresponding output "a, c, c").

Overall, solving this problem involves combining techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze the patterns in the training data and generate predictions for new input sequences.
