In this file, we have three training examples and one test example. Each example consists of an input sequence (represented as a list of tokens) followed by an output sequence (also represented as a list of tokens). The goal is to learn a model that can predict the output sequence given the input sequence.

The first training example has an input sequence of "e, f, b, b, f, e, e, f, b" and an output sequence of "e, f, b". The second training example has an input sequence of "f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f" and an output sequence of "f, f, f". The third training example has an input sequence of "b, f, e, e, f, b, b, f, e" and an output sequence of "b, f, e".

The test example has an input sequence of "a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e, a, c, a, e, e" and we would like to predict the corresponding output sequence.

This is a simple example of a sequence prediction task, where the goal is to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. In this case, the input and output sequences are both made up of tokens from a vocabulary of 5 letters ("a", "b", "c", "d", and "e").
