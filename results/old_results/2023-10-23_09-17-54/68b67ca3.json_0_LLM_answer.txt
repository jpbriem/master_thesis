This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the `neural_network` module in Python to create and train a neural network for sequence prediction tasks. The notebook provides examples of how to define the training data, create the neural network architecture, and train the model. It also includes test cases to demonstrate the performance of the trained model on unseen data.

The first section of the notebook imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy and the `neural_network` module. The next section defines the training data, which consists of input sequences and corresponding output sequences. In this case, the input sequences are made up of letters (either 'a' or 'b'), and the output sequences are either a single letter (either 'a' or 'b') or a pair of letters (either 'c', 'a' or 'd', 'a').

The following section creates a neural network architecture with one hidden layer containing 16 neurons. The input layer has 5 neurons, corresponding to the length of the input sequences, and the output layer has 2 neurons, corresponding to the length of the output sequences. The hidden layer uses a ReLU activation function, and the output layer uses a softmax activation function to produce probabilities over the possible output classes.

The next section trains the model using the training data. It splits the data into training and validation sets, sets the learning rate to 0.01, and runs 50 epochs of training. It then evaluates the model on the validation set and prints the loss and accuracy at each epoch.

Finally, the notebook tests the trained model on unseen data by providing it with input sequences and comparing its output predictions to the correct output sequences. It also includes some additional examples to demonstrate the flexibility of the trained model.
