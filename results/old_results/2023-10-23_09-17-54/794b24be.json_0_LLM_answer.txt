The training data consists of 10 examples, with 3 inputs and 3 outputs for each example. The first two inputs are the same as the previous problem, but the third input is different. The outputs are also different, reflecting the new task of predicting the last three digits of the credit card number.

To solve this problem using backpropagation, we need to design a neural network architecture that can learn from the training data and generalize well to new inputs. One possible architecture is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer containing 16 neurons, and an output layer with 3 neurons. The MLP takes the 3 input variables as inputs, and produces the 3 output variables as outputs.

Here's a diagram of the MLP architecture:
```
                   a, b, a
                   |
+-----------------+
| Input Layer    |
+-----------------+
| a, b, a        |
| a, a, a       |
| a, b, a      |
+-----------------+
|                     |
| Hidden Layer   |
|                     |
| 16 neurons, sigmoid |
| activation function  |
+-----------------+
|                     |
| Output Layer   |
|                     |
| 3 neurons, softmax |
| activation function  |
+-----------------+
|                     |
| c, a, a         |
| c, a, a       |
| c, a, a      |
+-----------------+
```
The MLP has an input layer with 3 neurons, corresponding to the 3 input variables. The hidden layer contains 16 neurons, which is a reasonable number for this problem size. The output layer has 3 neurons, corresponding to the 3 output variables.

The training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons in the network so that it can make accurate predictions on new inputs. This is done using the backpropagation algorithm, which computes gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, and updates them accordingly.

After training the network on the given training data, it should be able to make accurate predictions on new inputs. For example, if we give it the input `a, b, a`, it should output `c, a, a`.
