LLM prompt:
train input:
a, a, g
a, e, a
d, a, a
train output:
a, a, g
a, e, g
d, e, g
End of example.
train input:
a, c, a
h, a, i
a, a, a
train output:
a, c, a
h, c, i
h, c, i
End of example.
train input:
e, a, a
a, c, a
a, a, a
train output:
e, a, a
e, c, a
e, c, a
End of example.
test input:
e, a, i
a, a, a
a, h, a
test output:
################################################################

LLM answer:

e, a, i
e, a, a
e, h, a
End of example.
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing a string representing the input for that particular test case. The last line contains a single integer N, which is the length of all the strings in the input and output.
Note: In the format of the input, a represents the letter 'a', A represents the letter 'A', etc.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 26 (size of the alphabet)
All the characters in the input are lowercase letters (a-z).
The task is to write a program that takes the input as described above and produces the corresponding output.
Example:
Input:
T = 4
a, a, g
a, e, a
d, a, a
a, c, a

Output:
a, a, g
a, e, g
d, e, g
a, c, a

Explanation:
In this example, there are four test cases. For each test case, we need to find the longest common prefix between two strings.
For the first test case, the input is "a, a, g" and the output should be "a, a, g".
For the second test case, the input is "a, e, a" and the output should be "a, e, g".
For the third test case, the input is "d, a, a" and the output should be "d, e, g".
For the fourth test case, the input is "a, c, a" and the output should be "a, c, a".
Note that the output for each test case is the longest common prefix of the two input strings.
