LLM answer:

a, c, a
a, a, c
a, c, a
\end{code}

The task is to predict the next word in the sequence given the previous words. The training data contains three examples with six input words and three output words each. The test data contains one example with six input words and three output words. Your goal is to learn a model that can predict the next word in the sequence given the previous words.

Here's a hint to get you started:

Notice that the first word in the input sequence is always the same as the first word in the output sequence. Also, the second word in the input sequence is always the same as the second word in the output sequence. Can you use this observation to help you solve the problem?
