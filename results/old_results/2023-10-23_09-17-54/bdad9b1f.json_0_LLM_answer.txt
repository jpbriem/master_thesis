This is an example of a sequence prediction task, where the model needs to predict the next element in a sequence based on the context provided by the previous elements. The input and output sequences are given as pairs of tokens (e.g., "a", "i"), and the model needs to learn the relationship between these tokens to make accurate predictions.

The training data consists of multiple examples, each with its own input and output sequence. The first line of each example specifies the input sequence, and the second line specifies the corresponding output sequence. The last two lines of each example are blank.

The test data at the end is similar, but it does not have any corresponding output sequence - it's just a set of input sequences that the model should be able to predict based on what it learned from the training data.
