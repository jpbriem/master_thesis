\end{code}

I'm trying to use the `fit` method on the training data to create a model that can predict the output for a given input, but I keep getting an error message saying that the list of labels is not defined. Here's my code so far:

\begin{code}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load training data
train_input = [...]; train_output = [...]

# Create linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit model to training data
model.fit(train_input, train_output)

# Predict output for test data
predictions = model.predict(test_input)

# Evaluate accuracy of predictions
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_output, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
\end{code}

Can someone please help me figure out what's going wrong? Thanks!

Answer: The issue is that your `train_input` and `train_output` lists are not properly formatted. They should be 2D arrays with shape `(num_samples, num_features)` where `num_samples` is the number of samples in your dataset and `num_features` is the number of features in each sample.

In your case, it seems like you have a list of inputs and outputs where each element in the list is a separate input-output pair. To fix this, you need to reshape your data into the correct format. You can do this by using the `reshape` method:
```
import numpy as np

# Reshape training data
train_input = np.reshape(train_input, (len(train_input), 1))
train_output = np.reshape(train_output, (len(train_output), 1))

# Reshape test data
test_input = np.reshape(test_input, (len(test_input), 1))

# Create linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit model to training data
model.fit(train_input, train_output)

# Predict output for test data
predictions = model.predict(test_input)

# Evaluate accuracy of predictions
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_output, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
This should fix the error and allow you to train your model correctly.
