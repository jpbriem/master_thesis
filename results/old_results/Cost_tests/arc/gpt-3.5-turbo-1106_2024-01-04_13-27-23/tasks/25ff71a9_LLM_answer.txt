Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Your task is to give a description about the dimensions of an input and output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'grid_view': 'describe the dimension of the input and output grid.', 'pixel_view': 'describe the pixels of the input and output grid, focusing on shape, amount, size, position, values, counts, symmetry', 'object_view': 'describe the objects in the input grid and output grid, focusing on shape, amount, size, position, values, cell count'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'description': {'input_dimension': 'Regarding all input grids, is there a pattern describing the typical dimension of an input grid? e.g. all have the same fixed dimension or random or varying dimensions with a pattern..', 'output_dimension': 'Regarding all output grids, is there a pattern describing the typical dimension of an output grid? e.g. all have the same fixed dimension or varying dimensions with a pattern dependend on certain characteristics of the input grid; be specific and explain how to determine the output grid dimension!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:

You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.

Sample Prompt:
You are given a series of example input and output pairs that share the same logical pattern of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'i' represent different colors and '.' represents the background. For example, [['.','b','.'],['.','.','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The values from \'a\' to \'i\' represent different colors and \'.\' represents the background. For example, [[\'.\',\'b\',\'.\'],[\'.\',\'.\',\'c\']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color \'b\' at position (1,0) and color \'c\' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process \n- Geometry & topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have contact with each other.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given a description about the dimensions of an input and output grid.\nMoreover, you are given hints to determine parts of interest of the input grid and an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given step-by-step instructions that are generally applicable to transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if it fits to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions. Be as critical as possible with all pattern details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {\'test_output_analysis\': \'analyze if the given test output fits to the given description, overall pattern, and instructions.\', \'value\': \'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.\'}. Do not use quotation marks \' or " within the fields.\n', 'user': 'The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[a, a, a], [., ., .], [., ., .]]\noutput: [[., ., .], [a, a, a], [., ., .]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[., ., .], [a, a, a], [., ., .]]\noutput: [[., ., .], [., ., .], [a, a, a]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[., a, .], [a, a, .], [., ., .]]\noutput: [[., ., .], [., a, .], [a, a, .]]\n\nExample_4:\ninput: [[., b, b], [., ., b], [., ., .]]\noutput: [[., ., .], [., b, b], [., ., b]]\n\ndescription:\n\ninput dimension: The typical dimension of an input grid is 3x3 for all examples.\noutput dimension: The typical dimension of an output grid is 3x3 for all examples, with the position of the object being shifted according to the transformation pattern.\n\noverall pattern:\n\nparts of interest: The position and color of the objects and background elements are the key parts of interest in all examples.\noverall pattern: The overall pattern involves shifting the position of the object (non-background element) in the input grid to a different row in the output grid, while shifting the background element from that row to the original position of the object.\n\n\ninstructions: To transform an input grid into its output grid, identify the position of the object in the input grid and its corresponding position in the output grid. Move the object from its original position in the input grid to the identified position in the output grid, and move the background element from the identified position in the output grid to the original position of the object in the input grid. This transformation is based on the positions of the objects and background elements in the input grid.\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[b, ., .], [b, ., .], [., ., .]]\n\noutput: [[], [], []]'}
