LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a very interesting problem. I will try to provide an approach to solve it.

Firstly, let us define some terms:

- **Input**: A 2D array of integers representing the initial state of the system.
- **Output**: A 2D array of integers representing the final state of the system.
- **Grid Changes**: Any change in the dimensions of the input/output grids.
- **Pixel Changes**: Any change in the individual pixel values of the input/output grids.
- **Object Changes**: Any change in the objects present in the input/output grids.
- **Overall Pattern**: The underlying rule that maps the input to the output.
- **Instructions**: A set of rules defining how to transform the input into the output.
- **Test Output**: The result of applying the instructions to a test input.

Now, let us look at the examples provided in the prompt:

**Train Input:**

```
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]
]
```

**Train Output:**

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

**Test Input:**

```
[
    [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0],
    [5, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 4, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Test Output:**

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

From these examples, we can see that the overall pattern is to replace certain values in the input grid with zeros. Specifically, any value greater than 1 is replaced with 0. This means that the output grid has fewer objects than the input grid.

To understand the grid changes, we need to compare the dimensions of the input and output grids. In this case, both grids have the same dimensions. Therefore, there are no grid changes.

Next, let us look at the pixel changes. We can see that the values of the input grid have been modified to produce the output grid. Specifically, the values at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), and (3,1) have been changed from 2 to 0. This indicates that the pixels at these positions have been removed from the output grid.

Finally, let us examine the object changes. Since the
