You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",

}

The given input-output pairs exhibit a pattern of moving objects, changing colors, and flipping/rotating grids. Based on this information, we can create a set of instructions to describe the transformation process.

Instructions:

1. Start with an empty grid.
2. For each input pixel, draw a line connecting it to its corresponding output pixel.
3. For each input object, find its corresponding output object and draw a line connecting them.
4. If the input object has moved, update its position in the output grid accordingly.
5. If the input object has changed color, update its color in the output grid accordingly.
6. If the input grid has been flipped or rotated, apply the same operation to the output grid.
7. Return the resulting output grid.

Using these instructions, we can transform the test input grid as follows:

Test Input Grid:
0, 3, 0, 3, 3
0, 0, 3, 0, 0
3, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 3
0, 0, 0, 0, 3

Transformed Output Grid:
5, 5, 5
0, 5, 0
0, 5, 0
5, 5, 5
0, 5, 0
0, 5, 0

Explanation:

1. We start with an empty grid.
2. We draw lines connecting each input pixel to its corresponding output pixel. Since the input pixels are all zero, we get a grid of lines that follow the pattern of the input grid.
3. We find the corresponding output objects for each input object and draw lines connecting them. In this case, there are no input objects, so we don't need to do anything here.
4. We check if any input objects have moved. Since there are no input objects, we don't need to do anything here.
5. We check if any input objects have changed color. Since there are no input objects, we don't need to do anything here.
6. We check if the input grid has been flipped or rotated. It hasn't, so we don't need to do anything here.
7. We return the resulting output grid, which consists of a 3x3 grid of lines that follow the pattern of the input grid.
