You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid. The input grid has 5 rows and 5 columns, while the output grid has 4 rows and 4 columns.",
"pixel_changes": "The pixel values in the input grid have changed in the output grid. The top-left corner has changed from 5 to 2, the top-right corner has changed from 5 to 0, the bottom-left corner has changed from 5 to 8, and the bottom-right corner has changed from 5 to 0.",
"object_changes": "There are 4 objects in the input grid: a 2x2 square in the top-left corner, a 2x2 square in the top-right corner, a 1x2 rectangle in the bottom-left corner, and a 1x2 rectangle in the bottom-right corner. In the output grid, the 2x2 squares have been transformed into 1x1 squares, and the 1x2 rectangles have been transformed into 1x1 squares as well. The total number of objects remains the same, but their sizes and positions have changed.",
"overall_pattern": "The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a reflection around the diagonal axis, followed by a scaling factor of 0.5 in both dimensions, and finally, a translation of 1 pixel to the right and 1 pixel down.",
"instructions": "To apply the transformation, first reflect the input grid around the diagonal axis. Then, scale the grid by a factor of 0.5 in both dimensions using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Finally, translate the grid by 1 pixel to the right and 1 pixel down.",
"test_output": "The resulting output grid is:

2, 2
2, 0
0, 0
0, 0
0, 0

This output grid is obtained by applying the transformation instructions to the test input grid."
