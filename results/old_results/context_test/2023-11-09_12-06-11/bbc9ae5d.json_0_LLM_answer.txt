You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",

"instructions": "Describe the transformation actions in detail step by step",
"test_output": "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"
}

The given input-output pairs appear to follow a simple pattern of copying and repeating certain parts of the input grid to create the output grid. Based on this observation, we can infer the following rules:

* Reflection: The output grid is a reflection of the input grid, flipped horizontally.
* Grid Changes: The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid, with the output grid having one more row and column than the input grid.
* Pixel Changes: The pixels in the output grid are a copy of the pixels in the input grid, shifted to the right and down by one pixel.
* Object Changes: The objects in the output grid are identical to the objects in the input grid, but translated to the right and down by one pixel.
* Overall Pattern: The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a reflection and shifting of the input grid to create the output grid.
* Instructions: To transform the input grid into the output grid, first flip the input grid horizontally, then shift it right and down by one pixel.
* Test Output: Applying these instructions to the test input grid yields the following output grid:

1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

Note that this solution assumes that the input-output pairs provided are representative of the entire problem domain. If there are additional constraints or patterns present in the problem, the solution may need to be modified accordingly.
