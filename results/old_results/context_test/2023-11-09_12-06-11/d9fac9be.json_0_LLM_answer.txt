[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

  {
"reflection": "Reflecting on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid.",
"pixel_changes": "There are changes in the pixels between the input and output grids, including movement or pattern changes.",
"object_changes": "There are changes in the objects between the input and output grids, including movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count.",
"overall_pattern": "The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a transformation that changes the grid dimensions, pixel values, and object properties.",
"instructions": "The transformation actions are:

1. Increase the grid size by adding rows and columns.
2. Change the pixel values of certain cells to create a specific pattern.
3. Move objects around in the grid while maintaining their original size and shape.
4. Adjust the size and shape of some objects to fit them into specific spaces.
5. Rotate objects by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise.
6. Reflect objects horizontally or vertically.
7. Combine multiple objects into one single object.
8. Split an object into two or more smaller objects.
9. Replace certain objects with new ones.
10. Remove objects entirely from the grid.

To apply these instructions to the test input grid, we would first increase the grid size by adding rows and columns. Then, we would change the pixel values of certain cells to create a specific pattern. Next, we would move objects around in the grid while maintaining their original size and shape. After that, we would adjust the size and shape of some objects to fit them into specific spaces. Finally, we would rotate objects by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, reflect objects horizontally or vertically, combine multiple objects into one single object, split an object into two or more smaller objects, replace certain objects with new ones, and remove objects entirely from the grid. The resulting output grid would then be the transformed version of the test input grid.",
"test_output": "The resulting output grid after applying the transformation instructions to the test input grid is:
