You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",

"instructions": "Describe the transformation actions in detail step by step",

}

The given train input-output pairs exhibit a pattern of translating the input grid by some cells in the x or y direction, scaling the grid up or down, and/or flipping the grid horizontally or vertically. Additionally, there might be noise pixels added or removed from the grid.

Based on the given examples, we can infer the following rules:

1. Reflection: The input grid can be reflected horizontally, vertically, or both, resulting in a mirrored version of the original grid.
2. Grid changes: The dimension of the input grid can change, either by adding or removing rows or columns, or by scaling the grid up or down.
3. Pixel changes: Pixels can move or change their color, creating patterns such as lines, rectangles, or more complex shapes.
4. Object changes: Objects in the grid can move, change size, shape, or position, or their values can change.
5. Overall pattern: The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a combination of reflection, grid changes, pixel changes, object changes, and noise addition/removal.
6. Instructions: To transform the input grid, apply the following steps in order:
a. Reflect the grid horizontally, vertically, or both.
b. Add, remove, or modify rows or columns to change the grid's dimension.
c. Scale the grid up or down.
d. Move, rotate, or flip objects in the grid.
e. Change the color or value of pixels or objects.
f. Add or remove noise pixels.
7. Test output: Applying the above instructions to the test input grid should result in the following output:

test output:
2, 2, 2
0, 2, 0
0, 0, 0

Explanation:

* Reflecting the input grid horizontally and vertically creates a mirrored version of the original grid.
* Adding two rows and one column to the grid changes its dimension.
* Scaling the grid up by a factor of 2 results in twice the number of pixels in each direction.
* Moving the top-left object one cell to the right and the middle object one cell down creates a new pattern.
* Changing the color of the top-right object from 1 to 2 adds variety to the output.
* Adding noise pixels to the bottom-left corner creates a more realistic image.
