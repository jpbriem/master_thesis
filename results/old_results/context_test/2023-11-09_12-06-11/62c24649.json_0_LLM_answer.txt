You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid.",
"pixel_changes": "There are changes in the pixel values between the input and output grids.",
"object_changes": "There are changes in the objects between the input and output grids.",
"overall_pattern": "The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a transformation that involves changing the pixel values and object positions while maintaining the same grid dimensions.",
"instructions": "The transformation actions are as follows:

1. Reverse the pixels in each row of the input grid.
2. Swap the values of every other pixel in the first and third columns of the input grid.
3. Move the top-left quadrant of the input grid to the bottom-right quadrant.
4. Replace the values in the second and fourth rows of the input grid with the corresponding values from the first and third rows, respectively.
5. Flip the values in the second and fourth columns of the input grid horizontally.
6. Change the values in the first and third rows of the input grid to their negatives.
7. Rotate the input grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
8. Add a border of 1s around the input grid.
9. Multiply the values in the input grid by 2.
10. Subtract the minimum value in the input grid from all values in the grid.
11. Divide the values in the input grid by their maximum value.
12. Modify the input grid so that every second pixel is set to 0.
13. Set the values in the input grid to their absolute values.
14. Normalize the values in the input grid to the range [0, 1].",
"test_output": "The resulting output grid is:

1, 1, 0
0, 3, 2
3, 3, 0

The transformed input grid is:

1, 1, 0
0, 3, 2
3, 3, 0

The difference between the input and output grids is:

1, 1, 0
0, 3, 2
3, 3, 0

The pattern in the input-output pairs is:

1. The input grid has a 3x3 square shape.
2. The output grid has a 3x3 square shape.
3. There are no changes in the grid dimensions.
4. The pixel values in the input grid are modified to create the output grid.
5. The objects in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
6. The overall pattern is a transformation that maintains the grid dimensions and modifies the pixel values and object positions."
