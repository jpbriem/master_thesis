You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {

"grid_changes": "the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid",
"pixel_changes": "the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",

}

To solve this task, we will analyze the given input-output pairs and identify the common patterns and relationships between them. We will then create a set of instructions that can be applied to any input grid to produce the corresponding output grid.

From the given examples, we can observe that the input-output pairs share a common pattern, where certain elements in the input grid are transformed into specific elements in the output grid. Specifically, we notice that:

* A single pixel of value 2 in the input grid is transformed into a line of three pixels of value 2 in the output grid, with the central pixel having a value of 1.
* A line of three pixels of value 2 in the input grid is transformed into a single pixel of value 2 in the output grid, surrounded by two pixels of value 0.
* A single pixel of value 3 in the input grid is transformed into a line of three pixels of value 3 in the output grid, with the central pixel having a value of 1.
* A line of three pixels of value 3 in the input grid is transformed into a single pixel of value 3 in the output grid, surrounded by two pixels of value 0.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rules for transforming an input grid into an output grid:

1. If a pixel in the input grid has value 2, it will become a line of three pixels in the output grid, with the central pixel having a value of 1.
2. If a line of three pixels in the input grid has value 2, it will become a single pixel in the output grid, surrounded by two pixels of value 0.
3. If a pixel in the input grid has value 3, it will become a line of three pixels in the output grid, with the central pixel having a value of 1.
4. If a line of three pixels in the input grid has value 3, it will become a single pixel in the output grid, surrounded by two pixels of value 0.

We can now apply these rules to the test input grid to obtain the test output grid. The test input grid has dimensions 8x8, and the test output grid will have the same dimensions.

Here are the steps to transform the test input grid into the test output grid:

1. Start by scanning the test input grid row by row, and applying rule 1 to each pixel. If a pixel has value 2, replace it with a line of three pixels with value 2, with the central pixel having value 1.
2. Scan the test input grid again, but this time apply rule 2 to each line of three pixels. If a line has value 2, replace it with a single pixel of value 2, surrounded by two pixels of value 0.
3. Apply rule 3 to each pixel in the test input grid, replacing each pixel with value 3 with a line of three pixels of value 3, with the central pixel having value 1.
4. Finally, apply rule 4 to each line of three pixels in the test input grid, replacing each line with a single pixel of value 3, surrounded by two pixels of value 0.

After applying these rules, we obtain the test output grid, which has the same dimensions as the test input grid. The resulting grid is:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
