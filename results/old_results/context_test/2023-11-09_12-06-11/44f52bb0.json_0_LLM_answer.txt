You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The given train input and output pairs share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background.

From the given examples, we can observe that the input-output relationship is based on geometry and topology. The transformations are conditional and based on the objects or shapes in the grid.

The reflections are based on the symmetry of the objects in the grid. When there are two identical objects in the grid, they are reflected around the vertical axis. If there are three identical objects, they are reflected around the horizontal axis. Otherwise, there is no reflection.

The grid changes when there are objects touching the boundary of the grid. In this case, the grid expands or contracts to accommodate the objects.

The pixel changes describe the movements or pattern changes in the grid. The objects move or change their pattern according to certain rules.

The object changes describe the movements, size, shape, position, value, and cell count of the objects in the grid. The objects can move, change their size, shape, or position, or have a different value or cell count compared to the original grid.

The overall pattern describes the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs. It is observed that the patterns are based on symmetries and reflections of the objects in the grid.

The instructions describe the transformation actions in detail step by step. They include the conditions for reflections, grid changes, pixel changes, and object changes.

Based on the observations and analysis, the test input grid can be transformed using the instructions to obtain the resulting output grid.
