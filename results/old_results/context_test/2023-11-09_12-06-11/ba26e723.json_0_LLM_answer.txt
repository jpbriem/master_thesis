[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  reflection: The input-output pairs exhibit a consistent pattern of replacing a 2x2 block of color '4' with a 2x2 block of color '6'. The blocks are always located at the same positions in the grid, with the top-left corner of the block being at position (1,1) in the input grid.

grid_changes: The dimension of the input grid remains the same, but the output grid has an additional row and column, resulting in a larger grid.

pixel_changes: There are no pixel changes in the output grid compared to the input grid.

object_changes: There is one object in the input grid, which is a 2x2 block of color '4'. In the output grid, there are two objects - a 2x2 block of color '6' at the same position as the original block, and a new 2x2 block of color '6' at position (3,3).

overall_pattern: The simplest input-output relationship is a transformation that replaces a 2x2 block of color '4' with a 2x2 block of color '6', while maintaining the same grid dimensions.

instructions: To apply the transformation, we need to iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is part of a 2x2 block of color '4', replace it with color '6'. Then, add a new 2x2 block of color '6' at position (3,3) in the output grid.

test_output: Here is the resulting output grid after applying the transformation to the test input grid:
