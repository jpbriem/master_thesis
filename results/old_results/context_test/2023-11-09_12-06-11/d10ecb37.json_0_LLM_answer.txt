You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The given input-output pairs exhibit a pattern of geometric transformations, specifically translations, rotations, and reflections. The objects in the grid are moved, rotated, or reflected, but their relative positions remain unchanged. The input-output relations can be described as follows:

1. Train input 1:
The input grid has a vertical symmetry, and the output grid is obtained by reflecting the input grid around the vertical axis.
2. Train input 2:
The input grid has a horizontal symmetry, and the output grid is obtained by reflecting the input grid around the horizontal axis.
3. Train input 3:
The input grid consists of three rows and three columns. The middle row and column are unchanged, while the top and bottom rows and left and right columns are interchanged. The output grid is obtained by swapping the top and bottom rows and left and right columns.
4. Test input:
The input grid has a rotation symmetry of 180 degrees. The output grid is obtained by rotating the input grid by 180 degrees around the center.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rules for the transformation:

1. Reflection: If the input grid has a symmetry, the output grid will be obtained by reflecting the input grid around the corresponding axis.
2. Rotation: If the input grid has a rotation symmetry, the output grid will be obtained by rotating the input grid by the corresponding angle around the center.
3. Row/column interchange: If the input grid has a row or column that remains unchanged, the output grid will be obtained by interchanging the top and bottom rows or left and right columns, respectively.

These rules can be applied in a sequential manner to obtain the output grid for a given input grid. Therefore, the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a combination of reflection, rotation, and row/column interchange.
