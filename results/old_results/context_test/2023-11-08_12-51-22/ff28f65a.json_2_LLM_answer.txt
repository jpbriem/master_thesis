LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a color. The task is to find the simplest possible relation between the input and output grids, described using six fields: reflection, grid changes, pixel changes, object changes, overall pattern, and instructions. The goal is to describe the transformation actions in detail, step by step, and apply them to the test input grid to produce the test output grid.

The input grid has dimensions 7x7, while the output grid has dimensions 6x6. There are no empty cells in the input grid, but there are empty cells in the output grid. The input grid contains five objects - two yellow objects, two blue objects, and one red object. The output grid contains four objects - three yellow objects and one blue object.

The reflection is to reflect on the answer, considering the given examples and the fact that there are no calculations involved. The grid changes are that the output grid has one fewer row and column than the input grid. The pixel changes are that some pixels have changed color, with some yellow pixels becoming blue and vice versa. The object changes are that one blue object has disappeared, and one yellow object has appeared. The overall pattern is that the input grid has been transformed into the output grid through a series of simple operations, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and shifting.

The instructions to transform the test input grid are as follows:

1. Flip the grid horizontally.
2. Rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Scale the grid up by a factor of 1.5 in both dimensions.
4. Shift the grid to the right by two cells and down by one cell.
5. Change the color of every second pixel in each row to yellow.
6. Change the color of every third pixel in each column to blue.
7. Replace the top-left corner of the grid with a copy of the bottom-right corner.
8. Replace the bottom-left corner of the grid with a copy of the top-right corner.
9. Replace the top-right corner of the grid with a copy of the bottom-left corner.
10. Replace the bottom-right corner of the grid with a copy of the top-left corner.

Applying these instructions to the test input grid produces the test output grid.
