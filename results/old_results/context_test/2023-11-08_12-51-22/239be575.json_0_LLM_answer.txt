LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

Please provide your solution in JSON format.

{
    "reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
    "grid_changes": "Describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid",
    "pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
    "object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",
    "overall_pattern": "Describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",
    "instructions": "Describe the transformation actions in detail step by step",

}
```
The solution should be a JSON object with six properties: reflection, grid_changes, pixel_changes, object_changes, overall_pattern, and instructions.

The reflection property should contain a brief description of the reasoning behind the solution.

The grid_changes property should describe whether the dimensions of the input grid are different from those of the output grid, and if so, how they differ.

The pixel_changes property should describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes. This could include descriptions of any symmetries, translations, or rotations that occur in the input-output pairs.

The object_changes property should describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, and cell count. This could include descriptions of any objects that are added, removed, or transformed in the input-output pairs.

The overall_pattern property should describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs. This could include a high-level description of the transformation, such as "mirroring" or "rotating".

The instructions property should describe the transformation actions in detail, step by step. This could include specific instructions for how to apply the transformation to the input grid, such as "reflect the input grid horizontally" or "rotate the input grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees".

Finally, the test_output property should contain the resulting output grid when applying the instructions to the test input grid.

Here is an example solution:
```
{
    "reflection": "The input-output pairs demonstrate a consistent pattern of reflecting the input grid over various axes, sometimes combined with rotation or scaling. The test input grid contains a 2x2 square of value 2 in the center, surrounded by a 3x3 matrix of value 0. When reflected over the y-axis, the 2x2 square becomes a 2x2 rectangle with value 2, surrounded by a 3x3 matrix of value 0. When rotated 90 degrees clockwise, the 2x2 rectangle becomes a 1x2 rectangle with value 2, still surrounded by a 3x3 matrix of value 0.",
    "grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is 6x6, while the dimension of the output grid is also 6x6.",
    "pixel_changes": "The input pixels remain unchanged, but their positions change due to the reflections and rotations.",
    "object_changes": "There is one object in both the input and output grids - a 2x2 square/rectangle with value 2 in the center, surrounded by a 3x3 matrix of value 0. The object undergoes reflections and rotations, changing its shape and position in the output grid.",
    "overall_pattern": "Reflection and rotation of the input grid, combined with scaling of the output grid.",
    "instructions": "First, reflect the input grid over the y-axis. Then, rotate the result 90 degrees clockwise. Finally, scale the result up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.",
    "test_output": "[['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2'], ['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2'], ['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2'], ['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2'], ['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2'], ['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2']]"
}
```
This solution describes the input-output pairs as demonstrating a consistent pattern
