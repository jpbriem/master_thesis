LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The above prompt is an excerpt from a Kaggle competition. Your task is to provide a solution in JSON format that answers the questions asked in the prompt.

Here's a brief summary of what's being asked:

* Reflect on the answer: Provide some insight into the underlying patterns in the input-output pairs.
* Grid changes: Describe whether the dimensions of the input and output grids are the same or different.
* Pixel changes: Describe how the pixels in the input and output grids differ, focusing on movements or pattern changes.
* Object changes: Describe how the objects in the input and output grids differ, considering factors like movement, size, shape, position, value, and cell count.
* Overall pattern: Describe the most straightforward input-output relationship that applies to all input-output pairs.
* Instructions: Explain the steps needed to apply the transformation from input to output.
* Test output: Apply the transformation instructions to the test input grid and return the resulting output grid.

Your response should be in JSON format, with six keys corresponding to the six questions asked in the prompt. Here's an example of what your response might look like:

{
"reflection": "The input-output pairs exhibit a simple pattern of copying and pasting parts of the input grid to create the output grid.",
"grid_changes": "The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same.",
"pixel_changes": "Pixels in the input and output grids differ due to a translation of the top-left corner of the input grid by (x, y) = (2, 1).",
"object_changes": "There is one object in both the input and output grids, which has moved from the center of the input grid to the center of the output grid.",
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship can be described as copy, translate, and paste parts of the input grid to create the output grid.",
"instructions": "Step 1: Copy the entire input grid. Step 2: Translate the copied grid by (x, y) = (2, 1). Step 3: Paste the translated grid as the output grid.",
"test_output": "The resulting output grid is [['8', '2', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'], ['1', '8', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'], ['1', '8', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'], ['2', '1', '2', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'], ['1', '3', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'], ['1', '8', '1', '0', '0
