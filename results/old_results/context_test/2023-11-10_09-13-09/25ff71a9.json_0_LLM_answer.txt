You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "Describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",
"overall_pattern": "Describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs",

Here are the examples provided:

Example 1:
Input:
[['1', '1', '1'], ['0', '0', '0'], ['0', '0', '0']]
Output:
[['0', '0', '0'], ['1', '1', '1'], ['0', '0', '0']]

Example 2:
Input:
[['0', '0', '0'], ['1', '1', '1'], ['0', '0', '0']]
Output:
[['0', '0', '0'], ['0', '0', '0'], ['1', '1', '1']]

Example 3:
Input:
[['0', '1', '0'], ['1', '1', '0'], ['0', '0', '0']]
Output:
[['0', '0', '0'], ['0', '1', '0'], ['1', '1', '0']]

Example 4:
Input:
[['0', '2', '2'], ['0', '0', '2'], ['0', '0', '0']]
Output:
[['0', '0', '0'], ['0', '2', '2'], ['0', '0', '2']]

The reflection for these examples would be:

* Example 1: The output is a rotation of the input by 90 degrees clockwise.
* Example 2: The output is a rotation of the input by 90 degrees counterclockwise.
* Example 3: The output is a reflection of the input across the vertical axis.
* Example 4: The output is a reflection of the input across the horizontal axis, followed by a rotation by 90 degrees clockwise.

The overall pattern for these examples would be:

* The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
* The pixel values in the output grid are either the same or different from the corresponding pixel values in the input grid.
* The objects in the output grid are either the same or different from the corresponding objects in the input grid.

Based on these observations, we can infer that the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a combination of geometric transformations such as rotation, reflection, and scaling, possibly combined with changes in pixel values or object properties.

Therefore, the instructions for transforming the test input grid would be:

1. Apply a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise to the input grid.
2. Reflect the input grid across the vertical axis.
3. Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
4. Change the pixel value of every second pixel in the top row to '2'.
5. Return the resulting output grid.

The test output would be:

[['2', '0', '0'], ['2', '0', '0'], ['0', '0', '0']]
