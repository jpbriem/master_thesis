\end{code}

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the code is too long". You can post the entire program as a single block (with proper indentation). If it's really that big, then you should probably consider splitting it up into multiple files and using `import` to load them all in one place.

Answer: \section{1. Use `numpy`}

You are doing a lot of array manipulation here, which is very slow in Python. The best way to speed this up would be to use [`numpy`](http://www.scipy.org/Install.html), which provides fast vectorized operations on arrays.

For example, instead of iterating over each element of an array with a for loop, you could do something like this:

\begin{code}
a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]) # create a numpy array from your list
b = np.zeros((len(a), len(a[0])) # create another array filled with zeros
c = b + a                         # add the two together
print c                           # print out the result
# [[2 4]
# [7 8]]
\end{code}

This will give you a huge performance boost if you have large arrays.

\section{2. Don't repeat yourself}

Your code has a lot of repetition. For example, you define the same function twice: once at the top level, and again inside the class definition. This makes it harder to read and maintain your code. Instead, just move the function outside the class, so that both instances can call it.

Similarly, there is no need to copy-paste the same code for every possible combination of inputs. Just write a general case, and let the user specify the parameters they want to test.

\section{3. Avoid global variables}

Global variables make it hard to understand how your code works, because you don't know where they come from or when they change. They also make it impossible to reuse parts of your code without copying everything else along with it.

Instead, pass these values around explicitly as arguments to functions.

\section{4. Make your code modular}

Right now, your code does many different things. It reads data from a file, parses it, trains a neural network, tests a neural network, prints results, etc. Each of those steps should be its own function, so that you can easily re-use them later.

\section{5. Separate concerns}

The main problem with your code right now is that it tries to do too much. Your training algorithm shouldn't care about reading data from a file; your testing algorithm shouldn't care about writing data back to a file. These tasks should be separate.

\section{6. Testing}

Testing is important! Write lots of unit tests
