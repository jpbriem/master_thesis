Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the code is too long". You can post the entire program as a single block of code (with proper indentation). If it doesn't fit in one screen, that's fine - just scroll down to see more.

Answer: \section{1. The problem with your code:}

The main issue here is that you are using `for` loops instead of `while` loops. This means that even if the condition for the loop is false, the body will still be executed once. In this case, the first time through the outermost loop, the inner loop will execute zero times and then the body of the outer loop will run. So the first time through the outer loop, the value of `i` will be set to 49. Then when the second iteration starts, the value of `i` will already be 49 so the inner loop won't run at all.

You should use `while` loops instead of `for` loops because they allow you to control exactly how many times the loop runs. For example, you could do something like this:

\begin{code}
while i < len(input):
   ...
    while j < len(output):
       ...
\end{code}

This would ensure that the inner loop only executes as many times as there are elements in the list `output`.

\section{2. How to fix it:}

To fix this, you need to change your `for` loops into `while` loops. Here's an example of how you might do that:

\begin{code}
while i < len(input):
    # Do stuff...
    while j < len(output):
        # Do other stuff...
\end{code}

\section{3. Other issues:}

There are also some other issues with your code that you may want to address. For example, you have a lot of unnecessary comments. It's generally best practice to comment your code sparingly, or not at all. Also, you don't really need to indent your code; Python automatically does that for you. And finally, you shouldn't put spaces between your keywords and identifiers; that makes your code harder to read than necessary.
