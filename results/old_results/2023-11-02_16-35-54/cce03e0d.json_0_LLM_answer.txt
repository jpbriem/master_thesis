Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the inputs and the last number is the expected output". The first three numbers in each line are all inputs to your neural network (and they should be normalized). You can have as many outputs as you want; if you only need one output then just use a single neuron for that layer.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to create an ANN with 3 inputs and 1 output.

You don't really get to choose how many inputs or outputs there will be. It depends on the problem you are solving. If it's a classification task, then you would typically have one output per class. For regression tasks, you usually have one output.

In this case, since you are doing a binary classification, you could have either one or two outputs. One output would give you a probability between 0 and 1, while two outputs would give you a probability distribution over both classes.

\begin{blockquote}
The first two numbers are the inputs and the last number is the expected output.
\end{blockquote}

This doesn't make sense. All three values are inputs to your model. They represent some feature vector. What do these features represent? That's up to you.

If you are using Keras, you might find [this tutorial](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) helpful.
