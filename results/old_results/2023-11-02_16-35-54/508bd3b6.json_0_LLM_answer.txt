Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It might happen that a particular set of weights and biases will produce an accurate result for this problem, but there are many other sets of weights and biases which would also work.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to understand how neural networks learn.
\end{blockquote}

Neural Networks don't really learn in the sense we humans do. They are simply mathematical functions with parameters (weights) that can be adjusted so as to make them fit some data. In your case, the NN has two inputs, one hidden layer with three neurons, and one output. So, if you have $n$ training examples, then you need to find values for the six weights connecting the first layer to the second, and the four weights connecting the second layer to the third such that the sum of squared errors between the actual outputs and the desired ones is minimal. This is done using gradient descent or similar algorithms.

The way these weights are initialized before training is important because they determine the starting point from where the optimization algorithm starts searching for the optimal solution. If the initialization is bad, then the search may get stuck in local minima, i.e., solutions that are good enough but not optimal.

In general, the more complex the model, the better it fits the data, but the worse it performs on unseen data. For instance, if you add another hidden layer with ten neurons, then you will probably achieve perfect accuracy on the training set, but the performance on new data will likely deteriorate.

So, to answer your question, the NN does not learn anything. It is just a mathematical function whose parameters are optimized so as to best match the given data.
