Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two rows are the same". The first row is all zeros and the second row has a single non-zero element in it.

Answer: You can use [`np.diff`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.diff.html) to get the difference between consecutive elements along an axis (in this case, the first axis). If that difference is greater than one, then there must be at least one zero in between them.

For example, if we have `a = np.array([[1, 3], [4, 5]])`, then `np.diff(a)` gives us `[2, -1]`. Since `-1` is less than or equal to zero, we know that there was no zero in between those values. However, if we had `b = np.array([[1, 3], [6, 5]]`) instead, then `np.diff(b)` would give us `[5, -1]`, which tells us that there \em{was} a zero in between those values.

So, for your problem, you could do something like this:

\begin{code}
import numpy as np

def find_zeros(arr):
    return np.any((np.diff(arr, axis=0) > 0) & (np.diff(arr, axis=0) < 0))

print(find_zeros(np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]))) # False

print(find_zeros(np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
