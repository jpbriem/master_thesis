[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into an output. Let's analyze the training examples you provided:

In each training example, we have an input matrix and an output matrix. We need to find a pattern that takes the input matrix and transforms it into the corresponding output matrix. To do this, we can use a simple algorithm that applies the following steps:

1. If the input matrix has a value of 0 in any cell, replace it with 0 in the output matrix.
2. Otherwise, if the input matrix has a value of 1 in any cell, replace it with the value of the corresponding cell in the output matrix (if it exists). If the output matrix does not have a value for that cell, leave it blank.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all cells in the input matrix have been processed.

Using this algorithm, we can solve the first training example as follows:

Input:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0
```
Output:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
Explanation:

* In the input matrix, there are no values greater than 0, so we replace all values with 0 in the output matrix.
* Since the output matrix already contains a value of 7 in the top-left corner, we leave it unchanged.

Repeating this process for the remaining training examples, we can see that the output matrices always contain the same values as the corresponding input matrices, except for the top-left corner cell, which is replaced by the value 0.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
Using the same algorithm as before, we get the following output:

Test output:
```
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
Explanation:

* In the test input matrix, there are no values greater than 0, so we replace all values with 0 in the output matrix.
* Since the output matrix already contains a value of 0 in the top-left corner, we leave it unchanged.

Therefore, the pattern we identified earlier works correctly for both the training and test inputs.
