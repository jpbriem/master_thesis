LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the step-by-step pattern for each one.

Example 1:
The pattern in this case is simply to add the corresponding elements of the two grids. So, if the top left element of the first grid is `a`, and the top left element of the second grid is `b`, then the output will be `a + b`. If the top right element of the first grid is `c`, and the top right element of the second grid is `d`, then the output will be `c + d`. And so on.

Example 2:
In this example, we have a more complex pattern. We need to perform the following operations:

* For each element `x` in the first grid, subtract `x` from the corresponding element `y` in the second grid.
* If the result of the subtraction is negative, set it to 0.
* Otherwise, set it to the absolute value of the result.

So, if the top left element of the first grid is `a`, and the top left element of the second grid is `b`, then the output will be `|a - b|`. If the top right element of the first grid is `c`, and the top right element of the second grid is `d`, then the output will be `|c - d|`. And so on.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the pattern from Example 1, we get:

Output: 3 + 1 = 4, 2 + 5 = 7, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0

Using the pattern from Example 2, we get:

Output: |0 - 0| = 0, |1 - 0| = 1, |2 - 5| = 3, |3 - 0| = 3, |4 - 0| = 4, |5 - 0| = 5

Therefore, the test output is `[4, 7, 3, 3, 4]`.

Solution:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2
5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2
0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0
