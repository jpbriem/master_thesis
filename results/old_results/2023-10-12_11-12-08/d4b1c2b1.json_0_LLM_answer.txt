LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve some puzzles. I will provide you with a sequence of inputs and outputs, and your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to transform the input into the corresponding output.

Let's start with the first example:

Input: 7, 1, 7
Output: 7, 1, 7, 1, 7

Can you figure out the pattern?
