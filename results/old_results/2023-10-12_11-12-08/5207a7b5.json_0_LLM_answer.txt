LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a set of input values into a corresponding set of output values. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

Step 1: Identify the transformation rule

The first step is to identify the transformation rule that is being applied to the input values. In this case, it seems like the input values are being multiplied by a fixed value (either 8 or 6) before being transformed into the output values.

Step 2: Determine the input values

Next, determine the input values for each row of the input matrix. In this case, the input values are 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0.

Step 3: Apply the transformation rule

Now, apply the identified transformation rule to each input value in turn. For example, if the transformation rule is to multiply each input value by 8, then the output values would be:

8 × 0 = 0
8 × 0 = 0
8 × 0 = 0
8 × 5 = 40
8 × 0 = 0
8 × 0 = 0
8 × 0 = 0

Step 4: Repeat the process

Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each row of the input matrix, applying the transformation rule to each input value in turn. This will give you the output values for each row of the output matrix.

Step 5: Check your answer

Finally, check your answer by comparing the output values you obtained in step 4 with the correct output values provided in the example. If they match, then you have successfully solved the puzzle!

In summary, the solution to the puzzle involves identifying the transformation rule (in this case, multiplication by a fixed value), determining the input values, applying the transformation rule to each input value, repeating the process for each row of the input matrix, and checking your answer.
