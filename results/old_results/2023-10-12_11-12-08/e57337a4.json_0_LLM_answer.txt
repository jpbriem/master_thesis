LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a set of input and output pairs for a classification problem. I will now use the patterns observed in the training data to make predictions on the test input.

For the test input:
```
6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
```
I will predict the output to be:
```
0, 6, 0
```
Please let me know if this is correct or if you would like me to reevaluate.

Solution:
6, 0, 6
6, 6, 6
6, 6, 0
