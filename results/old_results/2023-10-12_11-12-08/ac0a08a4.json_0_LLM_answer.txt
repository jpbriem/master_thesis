LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the instructions you provided, I understand that the goal is to identify a step-by-step pattern for converting a given input into an output, where the input and output are represented as rows of numbers from 0 to 9.

From the examples you provided, it seems that the pattern involves performing the following operations:

1. If the input row has a 0 in the first position, then move the entire row to the right by one position.
2. If the input row has a 7 in the last position, then move the entire row up by one position.
3. Otherwise, do nothing.

Using this pattern, we can try applying it to the test input:

Input: 1, 0, 0

Step 1: Move the first row to the right by one position, since it has a 1 in the first position.

Output: 2, 0, 0

Step 2: Check if the last position (i.e., the third position) has a 7. Since it does not, move the entire row up by one position.

Output: 2, 2, 0

Therefore, the output for the test input is 2, 2, 0.

Solution:
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6
0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6
8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
