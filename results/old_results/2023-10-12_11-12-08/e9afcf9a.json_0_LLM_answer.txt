LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.
<</SYS>>

train input:
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9
train output:
3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9
9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3
End of example.
train input:
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
train output:
4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8
8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4
End of example.
test input:
6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of input and output is simply a rotation of the input by 90 degrees clockwise. That is, if the input is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, the corresponding output will be obtained.

So, applying this pattern to the final test input, we get:

Test input: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
Rotated input: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
Output: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6

Therefore, the test output is the same as the original test input.

Solution:
6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2
2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 6
