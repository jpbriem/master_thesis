LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from each input:

1. Look at the first row of the input. In this case, it has the value 5.
2. Check if there are any 5s in the output for that particular input. Yes, there is one 5 in the output for the first input.
3. Now look at the second row of the input. It has the value 0.
4. Check if there are any 0s in the output for that particular input. Yes, there are two 0s in the output for the first input.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each row of the input until you have checked all the values.

Based on the above process, you can identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from each input. For example, for the first input, the pattern is:

5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8

Where each number represents the value of the corresponding element in the input matrix. So, when you apply this pattern to the test input, you should get the same output as shown below:

5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle.
