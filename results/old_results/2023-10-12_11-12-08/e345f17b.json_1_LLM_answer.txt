[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output.

From the first two examples, we can see that the output consists of four numbers, where each number represents the number of times a particular digit appears in the input. Specifically, the output for each example is:

Example 1: 0, 0, 0, 4 (where 0 represents the absence of a digit, and 4 represents the digit 4)
Example 2: 0, 0, 4, 0 (again, 0 represents the absence of a digit, and 4 represents the digit 4)

Now, let's look at the next two examples:

Example 3: 6, 0, 0, 0 (the output is empty, indicating that no digit appears more than once in the input)
Example 4: 6, 6, 0, 0 (the output is also empty, indicating that no digit appears more than once in the input)

Finally, let's examine the last example:

Example 5: 0, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5 (the output is a combination of the digits 0, 6, and 5, which appear exactly once in the input)

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the pattern in the output is simply a list of the digits that appear exactly once in the input. In other words, if an input contains a digit x, then the corresponding output will contain the digit x exactly once.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5

Using the pattern we just identified, we can determine the output for the test input as follows:

Output: 0, 0, 0, 5 (since the digit 0 appears exactly once in the input, and the digit 5 appears exactly once in the input)

Therefore, the answer for the test input is 0, 0, 0, 5.

Solution:
4, 0, 4, 0
4, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 4, 4
0, 0, 4, 0
