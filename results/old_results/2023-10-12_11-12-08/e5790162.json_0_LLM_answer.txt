LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle.

The step-by-step pattern you observed in the examples is:

1. If there are any 0s in the input, replace them with 3s.
2. If there are any non-zero values in the input, multiply them by 3 and add 0.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the final test input:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0

Using the first rule (replace 0s with 3s), we get:

3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0

Now, using the second rule (multiply non-zero values by 3 and add 0), we get:

9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 27, 0, 0

Therefore, the output for the given test input is:

[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 27]
