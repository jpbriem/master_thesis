[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can identify the step-by-step pattern in the training examples:

1. Look for consistent patterns in the input values: In each training example, there are two sets of values - one for the top row and one for the bottom row. Notice that the values in these two rows are always the same, except for the last column (which is always 0). This means that the pattern involves shifting the values in the top row by one position to the right, and then adding a value of 0 to the last column.
2. Identify the repeating pattern: Based on the consistency of the patterns in the input values, you can identify a repeating pattern. For example, in the first training example, the pattern is:
```
0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
This pattern repeats every time the input values change.
3. Apply the pattern to the test input: Now that you have identified the repeating pattern, you can apply it to the test input. Start by shifting the values in the top row of the test input by one position to the right, and then add a value of 0 to the last column. This will give you an initial guess for the output value.

For example, if the test input is:
```
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
```
You would shift the values in the top row by one position to the right, like this:
```
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0
```
And then add a value of 0 to the last column, like this:
```
0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0
```
This gives you an initial guess for the output value, which is 0 in this case.
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach the end of the test input: Continue applying the pattern to the rest of the test input, shifting the values in the top row by one position to the right and adding a value of 0 to the last column. This will give you a sequence of output values, which should be the same as the output values in the training examples.

By following these steps, you should be able to solve the puzzle and determine the correct output values for the test input. Good luck!
