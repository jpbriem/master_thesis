[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these puzzles involves manipulating the values in each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output value. Here's how the pattern works:

1. Start by comparing the first value in each row of the input grid with the corresponding value in the output grid. If the two values match, then the output value for that row is simply the same as the input value. Otherwise, the output value is one greater than the input value.
2. For each subsequent row in the input grid, compare the first value with the corresponding value in the output grid. If they match, then the output value for that row is equal to the input value plus one. If they don't match, then the output value is equal to the input value minus one.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all rows in the input grid have been processed.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test Input: 1, 7, 7, 1, 7

Step 1: Compare the first value (1) in the input row with the corresponding value (1) in the output row. Since they match, the output value for this row is simply 1.

Step 2: Compare the second value (7) in the input row with the corresponding value (7) in the output row. Since they match, the output value for this row is also 7.

Step 3: Compare the third value (7) in the input row with the corresponding value (1) in the output row. Since they don't match, the output value for this row is 6 (i.e., 7 - 1).

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 for each remaining row in the input grid.

Therefore, the output for the test input is:

1, 7, 7, 6, 7
