LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the pattern for getting the output from the input consists of the following steps:

1. If the top row of the input contains only 0s, then the output will be all 0s.
2. Otherwise, if the top row of the input contains at least one non-zero value (i.e., a 1), then the output will be a sequence of 0s and 1s, where each 1 corresponds to the position of the non-zero value in the top row of the input.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each row of the input, starting from the second row downwards.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

Test input: 7, 0, 7

Step 1: Check the top row of the input. There is only one non-zero value (7) in the top row, so the output will have at least one 1.

Output: 0, 1, 0, 1

Great! Now you can try applying the pattern to other inputs and see how it works. Good luck!
