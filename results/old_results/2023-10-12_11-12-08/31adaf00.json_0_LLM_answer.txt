LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into a corresponding output. Let's analyze the training examples you provided:

In each training example, we have an input matrix `I` and a corresponding output matrix `O`. The input matrix consists of two types of elements: zeros and ones. The ones represent a "brick" (a 2x2 block) of value 5, while the zeros represent a gap between bricks. The goal is to find a sequence of operations that can be applied to the input matrix to produce the corresponding output matrix.

Here are some observations about the patterns observed in the training examples:

1. Each input matrix has exactly one brick of value 5 in it.
2. The position of the brick in the input matrix determines the corresponding position of the output brick in the output matrix.
3. When there are multiple bricks in the input matrix, they are always aligned horizontally.
4. The gaps between bricks in the input matrix determine the positions of the output bricks.
5. The output bricks are always placed on top of the corresponding input bricks.

Based on these observations, we can propose a simple algorithm to solve the puzzle:

1. Start by finding the location of the only brick of value 5 in the input matrix. This will give us the starting point for our sequence of operations.
2. For each subsequent operation, we will either move a brick up or down by one position, or rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. We will continue applying these operations until we have transformed the entire input matrix into the corresponding output matrix.

Let's apply this algorithm to your test input:

Input:
```
5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0
5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0
5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5
```
We start by finding the location of the only brick of value 5 in the input matrix:
```
  5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
Now, let's apply the algorithm:

Operation 1: Move the top brick down by one position.
```
  5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
