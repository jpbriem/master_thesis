LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each input is to shift the input by one position to the right, and then add the value of the top-most element of the resulting matrix to the corresponding element of the output matrix. Here's how it works:

1. Shift the input matrix to the right by one position.
2. Take the top-most element of the resulting matrix (i.e., the element at row 0, column 1).
3. Add the value of this element to the corresponding element of the output matrix.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0

We shift the input matrix to the right by one position:

Input matrix after shifting:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Now, we take the top-most element of the resulting matrix (i.e., the element at row 0, column 1):

Top-most element: 0

Adding this element to the corresponding element of the output matrix gives us the test output:

Test output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Great! It looks like the pattern is working correctly. Can you please provide more examples or the entire puzzle for me to solve?
