LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to determine the step-by-step pattern to transform each row of input values into the corresponding output value.

To start, let's analyze the first two examples:

Example 1:
Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6

Explanation:
The pattern in this example is simply to multiply each element of the input by 6. Therefore, the output for the next input can be obtained by multiplying each element of the input by 6 again.

Example 2:
Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6

Now, let's move on to the test input:

Test Input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Can you apply the same pattern to the test input to obtain the output?

Solution:
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
