LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
0, 0, 5
0, 5, 0
5, 0, 0
train output:
3, 3, 3
4, 4, 4
2, 2, 2
End of example.
train input:
0, 0, 5
0, 0, 5
0, 0, 5
train output:
3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3
3, 3, 3
End of example.
train input:
5, 0, 0
0, 5, 0
5, 0, 0
train output:
2, 2, 2
4, 4, 4
2, 2, 2
End of example.
train input:
0, 5, 0
0, 0, 5
0, 5, 0
train output:
4, 4, 4
3, 3, 3
4, 4, 4
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each input is to take the middle value of the row and use it to determine the corresponding output value. Here's how the pattern works:

1. Take the middle value of the first row (i.e., the second value).
2. Use this value to determine the corresponding output value (based on the examples provided, the output value will be either 3 or 4).
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each subsequent row.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input:
0, 0, 5
5, 0, 0
0, 5, 0

Applying the pattern, we get:

Output:
3, 3, 3

So the test output is indeed 3, 3, 3.
