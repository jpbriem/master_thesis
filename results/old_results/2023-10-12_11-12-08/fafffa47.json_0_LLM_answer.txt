LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

From the first example, we can see that the output consists of three numbers: `2`, `0`, and `0`. Whenever an input has a `9` value in the top row, the corresponding output value is `0`. And when there is no `9` in the top row, the output value is `2`.

In the second example, we observe that whenever there is a `0` value in the top left corner, the output value is `0`. Otherwise, the output value is `2`.

For the third example, we notice that when there is a `9` value in the middle column, the output value is `0`. Otherwise, the output value is `2`.

Based on these observations, we can create a simple rule to generate the output for any given input:

Rule: If the top row contains a `9`, then the output is `0`. Otherwise, the output is `2`.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input:

Test input: `9, 0, 9`

Using the rule above, we get the following output: `0, 0, 0`

So, the predicted output for the test input is `0, 0, 0`.

Solution:
0, 0, 0
2, 0, 0
0, 2, 0
