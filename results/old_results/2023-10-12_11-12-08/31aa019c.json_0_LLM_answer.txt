LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from the input:

1. Look at the first row of the input. In this case, it contains the values 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0.
2. Identify the number of times each value appears in the first row. For example, the value 0 appears twice, the value 2 appears once, and so on.
3. Use these counts to determine the corresponding values for each position in the output matrix. For example, since the value 0 appears twice in the first row, there should be two 0s in the output matrix at positions corresponding to the first row.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each row of the input.
5. Once you have determined the values for each position in the output matrix, fill them in using the counts you obtained in step 3.

Using this approach, you can solve the puzzle and obtain the output matrix shown below:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
The output matrix has the same shape as the input matrix, with the same number of rows and columns. Each element in the output matrix represents the corresponding value in the input matrix, based on the count you obtained in step 3.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
