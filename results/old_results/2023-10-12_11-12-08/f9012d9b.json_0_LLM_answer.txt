You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the instructions you provided, it seems like you have a puzzle where you need to find a step-by-step pattern to transform the input into the corresponding output. Here's how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the common elements between the input and output pairs. In each pair, there are some elements that appear in both the input and output. For example, in the first pair, we have "2" appearing in both the input and output. Similarly, in the second pair, we have "1" appearing in both the input and output.

Step 2: Find a simple transformation rule for each element. Once we identify the common elements, we can try to find a simple transformation rule for each one. For example, if we see "2" in both the input and output, we could use a transformation rule like "if input = 2, then output = 1". This rule will change every instance of "2" in the input to "1" in the output.

Step 3: Apply the transformation rules to the input. Now that we have identified the common elements and found transformation rules for each one, we can apply these rules to the input. We will start by applying the first transformation rule (the one we just created) to the input, and then move on to the next rule, and so on.

Step 4: Check the output. After applying all the transformation rules, we should check the resulting output to make sure it matches the expected output. If it doesn't match, we may need to go back and adjust one of the transformation rules.

Using this approach, let's solve the first few examples:

Example 1:
Input: 2, 1, 2, 1, 2
Output: 1, 1

We identify the common elements between the input and output as follows:

* Input: 2 appears once, 1 appears twice.
* Output: 1 appears once, 1 appears once.

Based on this, we create the following transformation rules:

* If input = 2, then output = 1.

Applying these rules to the input gives us:

Input: 2 → 1
1 → 1

So the output is indeed 1, 1.

Example 2:
Input: 8, 6, 0, 6
Output: 8

Identifying the common elements, we get:

* Input: 8 appears once, 6 appears twice.
* Output: 8 appears once.

Creating the transformation rules accordingly, we get:

* If input = 8, then output = 8.

Applying these rules to the input gives us:

Input: 8 → 8

So the output is indeed 8.

Example 3:
Input: 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2
Output: 5, 5

Identifying the common elements, we get:

* Input: 2 appears three times, 5 appears twice.
* Output: 5 appears twice.

Creating the transformation rules accordingly, we get:

* If input = 2, then output = 5.
* If input = 5, then output = 5.

Applying these rules to the input gives us:

Input: 2 → 5
5 → 5
2 → 5
5 → 5

So the output is indeed 5, 5.

Now, let's apply these steps to the test input:

Test input: 8, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0

Identifying the common elements, we get:

* Input: 8 appears twice, 1 appears once.
* Output: 8 appears twice, 0 appears once.

Creating the transformation rules accordingly, we get:

* If input = 8, then output = 8.
* If input = 1, then output = 0.

Applying these rules to the input gives us:

Input: 8 → 8
8 → 8
1 → 0

So the output is indeed 8, 8, 0, 0.
