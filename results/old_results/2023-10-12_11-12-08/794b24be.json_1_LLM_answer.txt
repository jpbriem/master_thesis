LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

From the first few examples, we can see that the output consists of three numbers (row wise) where each number is either 0 or 2. Moreover, the numbers in the output are always even.

Now, let's apply this observation to the test input:

Test Input: 0, 1, 0
0, 1, 1
1, 0, 0

Using the observed pattern, we can predict the output as follows:

Output: 0, 2, 0

Explanation:

* Row 1: 0 + 1 = 1, which is even, so the output value is 2.
* Row 2: 1 + 1 = 2, which is even, so the output value is 0.
* Row 3: 0 + 0 = 0, which is 0, so the output value is 0.

Therefore, the predicted output for the test input is 0, 2, 0.

Solution:
2, 2, 2
0, 2, 0
0, 0, 0
