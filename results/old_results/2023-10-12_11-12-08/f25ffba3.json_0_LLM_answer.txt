LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each input is to shift the values one position to the right and then add the value at that position to the original input.

Here's how it works:

* For each input, shift the values one position to the right (i.e., move the first value to the second position, the second value to the third position, and so on).
* Add the value at the new position to the original input.

For example, if the input is `0, 0, 0, 0`, after shifting the values one position to the right, we get `0, 0, 0, 1`. If we add 1 to the original input, we get `0, 0, 0, 2`.

Using this pattern, we can solve the first test input as follows:

`0, 0, 0, 0` + `1 = 1, 0, 0, 0` + `7 = 8, 1, 0, 0` + `1 = 9, 1, 3, 0` + `3 = 12, 4, 3, 0`

Therefore, the output for the first test input is `9, 1, 3, 0`.

Can you please provide me with the next test input?
