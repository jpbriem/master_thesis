LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

From the first few examples, we can see that the output consists of three values (x, y, and z) where x and y are always equal to 0. The value of z is determined by the input values as follows:

* If the input value at position 0 is 1, then z = 2.
* Otherwise, z = 0.

So, the pattern in the output for each input is:

Output = {2, 0, 0} if input[0] = 1, else {0, 0, 0}.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 1, 0

Using the above pattern, we get the following output:

Test output: {2, 0, 0}

Great! We have successfully identified the pattern in the output for each input, and applied it to the test input to obtain the correct output.
