LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the instructions you provided, I understand that you want me to analyze the given train input and output pairs and identify a step-by-step pattern to transform the input into the corresponding output.

After carefully examining the examples provided, I noticed that each input row consists of two types of values: 0s and non-zero values. Moreover, every output row has only one non-zero value, which is always located at position 0.

Here's my observation in a more formal way:

1. Each input row contains an equal number of 0s and non-zero values (i.e., 4 non-zero values).
2. Every output row has exactly one non-zero value, which is located at position 0.
3. The non-zero values in the input rows are never adjacent to each other.

Now, based on these observations, here's the step-by-step pattern to transform the input into the output:

Step 1: Replace all 0s in the input row with their nearest neighboring non-zero value (if there is one). If there are no non-zero values nearby, leave the 0 unchanged.

Step 2: Shift the remaining non-zero values in the input row by one position to the right.

Step 3: Set the value at position 0 in the resulting row to the nearest non-zero value among the shifted values. If there are no non-zero values after shifting, leave position 0 unchanged.

By repeating this process for each input row, we can obtain the corresponding output row.

To illustrate this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

Input: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 1: Replace the 0s with their nearest neighbors:
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 2: Shift the non-zero values to the right:
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0

Step 3: Set the value at position 0 to the nearest non-zero value:
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the output for the test input is:
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5]

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
