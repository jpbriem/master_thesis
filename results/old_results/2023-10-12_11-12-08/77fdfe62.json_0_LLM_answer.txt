[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've been given a puzzle with a series of input and output pairs, and your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input.

From the first pair of inputs and outputs, we can see that the pattern involves shifting the input by one position to the right, and then adding the value at each position to the previous value. So, if we start with the input `2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1`, we would get the output `0, 2, 0, 0`.

Using this pattern, we can apply it to the next input `9, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4`, which gives us the output `9, 4`.

For the third pair of inputs and outputs, we can see that the pattern involves multiplying the input by 2 and then adding a fixed value. In this case, the fixed value is 2. So, if we start with the input `6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1`, we would get the output `6, 2`.

Applying this pattern to the fourth pair of inputs and outputs, we can see that the pattern involves adding a fixed value (in this case, 0) to each element of the input, and then shifting the input by one position to the right. So, if we start with the input `3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`, we would get the output `3, 0`.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the final test input `3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4`:

Step 1: Shift the input by one position to the right, so we have `4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`.

Step 2: Add the value at each position to the previous value, so we have `4 + 1 = 5, 1 + 0 = 1, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the output for the final test input is `5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1`.

Solution:
0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0
3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0
0, 7, 0, 5, 5, 0
7, 7, 0, 5, 0, 5
0, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0
