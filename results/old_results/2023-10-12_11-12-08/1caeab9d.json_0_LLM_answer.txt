LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to determine the step-by-step pattern to transform each input row into its corresponding output row.

To start, let's analyze the first two examples:

Input: 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

From this example, we can observe that the pattern is simply to copy the value of the second element (i.e., the second number in each row) to every position in the output row. Therefore, if we have an input row like this:

Input: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17

We can transform it into the following output row using the same pattern:

Output: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17

Now, let's move on to the next example:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0, 2, 2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0

In this case, the pattern appears to be more complex. However, upon closer inspection, we can notice that the values in the output row are always twice the corresponding value in the input row, except for the last two positions where they are equal. Therefore, if we have an input row like this:

Input: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

We can transform it into the following output row using the same pattern:

Output: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32

Finally, let's apply the pattern to the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2

Using the same analysis as before, we can see that the pattern is to copy the value of the second element (i.e., the second number in each row) to every position in the output row. Therefore, the transformed output row would be:

Transformed output: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2

So far, so good! It looks like we've successfully solved the puzzle.
