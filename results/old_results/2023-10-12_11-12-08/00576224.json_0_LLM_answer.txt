LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
8, 6
6, 4
train output:
8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6
6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4
6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8
4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6
8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6
6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4
End of example.
train input:
7, 9
4, 3
train output:
7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9
4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3
9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7
3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4
7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9
4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3
End of example.
test input:
3, 2
7, 8

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for generating the output from the input consists of two steps:

Step 1: Shift the input by one position to the right.
Step 2: Multiply the top value of the resulting row by the bottom value of the original input.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input: (3, 2)

Step 1: Shift the input by one position to the right: (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2),...

Step 2: Multiply the top value of each row by the bottom value of the original input: (4 \* 2 = 8), (5 \* 2 = 10),...

Therefore, the test output is:

(8, 10)

Solution:
3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8
2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3
8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7
3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2
7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8
