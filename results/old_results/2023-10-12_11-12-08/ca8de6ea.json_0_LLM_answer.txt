LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

train input:
1, 0, 0, 0, 9
0, 5, 0, 8, 0
0, 0, 7, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 5, 0
9, 0, 0, 0, 1
train output:
1, 5, 9
8, 7, 8
9, 5, 1
End of example.
train input:
6, 0, 0, 0, 7
0, 2, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 3, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 2, 0
7, 0, 0, 0, 6
train output:
6, 2, 7
4, 3, 4
7, 2, 6
End of example.
train input:
2, 0, 0, 0, 1
0, 3, 0, 6, 0
0, 0, 4, 0, 0
0, 6, 0, 3, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 2
train output:
2, 3, 1
6, 4, 6
1, 3, 2
End of example.
test input:
7, 0, 0, 0, 5
0, 6, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 2, 0, 0
0, 4, 0, 6, 0
5, 0, 0, 0, 7

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each pair of inputs and outputs is as follows:

Step 1: Take the first number in the input row (the top number) and multiply it by 2.
Step 2: Add the product of Step 1 to the second number in the input row (the middle number).
Step 3: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each subsequent number in the input row.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input to get the test output:

Test input: 7, 0, 0, 0, 5

Step 1: Multiply the first number (7) by 2 = 14
Step 2: Add the result of Step 1 to the second number (0) = 14
Step 3: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each subsequent number in the input row

Therefore, the test output is: 14, 14, 5

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
