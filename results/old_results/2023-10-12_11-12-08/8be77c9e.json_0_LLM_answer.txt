LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves manipulating the values in each row of the input grid to produce the corresponding output value. Here's how the pattern works:

1. If the number of 1s in a row is even, then the output value for that row is 0. Otherwise, the output value is 1.
2. If the number of 0s in a row is even, then the output value for that row is 0. Otherwise, the output value is 1.
3. If the number of 1s in a row is odd, then the output value for that row is the opposite of the output value for the previous row (i.e., if the previous row's output value was 1, then the current row's output value is 0, and vice versa).

Using these rules, we can now apply them to the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1
1, 0, 0

Applying the pattern:

Row 1: 0 + 0 = 0 (even) -> output = 0
Row 2: 0 + 1 = 1 (odd) -> output = 1
Row 3: 1 + 0 = 0 (even) -> output = 0

Therefore, the test output is: [0, 1, 0].
