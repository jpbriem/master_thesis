LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for getting the output from the input is as follows:

For each row of the input, if the number in the first position is equal to 0, then the corresponding number in the output row is also 0. If the number in the first position is not equal to 0, then the corresponding number in the output row is equal to the number in the input row multiplied by 5.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 1, 0, 1
0, 0, 5, 0, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5

Applying the pattern, we get:

Test output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5

As expected, the test output matches the provided test input.

Solution:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 0, 5
5, 5, 1, 5, 1
