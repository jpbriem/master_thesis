[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems that the pattern for each input is to shift the values in the row by one position to the right, and then add the value in the corresponding position of the next row to the current row's value.

Here's how this pattern can be applied to the test input:

Test input:
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0
5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5

Applying the pattern:

Row 1: Shift the values in the row by one position to the right, and add the value in the corresponding position of the next row (row 2) to the current row's value:
5 + 0 = 5
0 + 3 = 3
0 + 0 = 0

Row 2: Shift the values in the row by one position to the right, and add the value in the corresponding position of the next row (row 3) to the current row's value:
5 + 0 = 5
3 + 0 = 3
0 + 5 = 5

Row 3: Shift the values in the row by one position to the right, and add the value in the corresponding position of the next row (row 4) to the current row's value:
5 + 0 = 5
3 + 0 = 3
5 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the output for the test input is:
[5, 3, 5, 5]

Solution:
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0
3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3
