LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a set of input values into a corresponding set of output values. Here's how I can help you solve it:

From your description, I understand that the input values are represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a different "train input." The output values are also represented as rows of numbers, where each row represents a different "train output."

To solve this puzzle, we need to find a pattern that takes each input value and transforms it into the corresponding output value. Since the input and output values are represented as rows of numbers, we can think of this pattern as a sequence of operations that take each input value and modify it according to some rule.

Here's one possible approach to solving this puzzle:

1. Start by analyzing the first input value in each row. Look for patterns in the digits within each input value, such as repeating sequences of digits (e.g., 0, 0, 0) or non-repeating sequences of digits (e.g., 5, 5, 5).
2. Once you've identified a pattern in an input value, try applying that pattern to the corresponding output value. For example, if you notice that the input value starts with a sequence of three 0s, you could try replacing those 0s with the corresponding digit in the output value (e.g., if the output value starts with 0,0,0, then replace the 0s in the input value with 0).
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each input value in the row, adjusting the pattern based on the output value.
4. Move on to the next row and repeat the process.

By following this approach, you should be able to identify the step-by-step pattern that transforms the input values into the corresponding output values. Good luck!
