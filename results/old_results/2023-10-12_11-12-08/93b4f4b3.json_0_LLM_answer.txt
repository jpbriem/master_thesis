[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can find the pattern to get the output for each input:

The pattern is based on the following rules:

1. If an input has a value of 8, then the corresponding output will have a value of 7.
2. If an input has a value of 0, then the corresponding output will have a value of 3.
3. If an input has a value of 5, then the corresponding output will have a value of 2.

Now, let's apply these rules to the test input:

Test input: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the first rule, if an input has a value of 8, then the corresponding output will have a value of 7. So, the output for the first row will be:

Output = 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0

Next, we'll apply the second rule to the next row:

Input 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0

Since the input has a value of 0, the corresponding output will have a value of 3. So, the output for this row will be:

Output = 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0

We'll continue applying these rules to each row of the test input until we reach the end. Let me know when you want me to stop explaining the pattern, and you can try solving the puzzle yourself.
