LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems that the pattern for each input is to shift the values in the input by one position to the right, and then add the value in the top-right corner of the input to the corresponding value in the output.

Here's how this pattern can be applied to the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0

Step 1: Shift the values in the input by one position to the right.

Input after shift: 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0

Step 2: Add the value in the top-right corner of the input (8) to the corresponding value in the output.

Output after addition: 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Therefore, the expected output for the test input is:

8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
