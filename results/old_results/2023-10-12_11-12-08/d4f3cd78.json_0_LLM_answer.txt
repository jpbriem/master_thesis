LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to find a step-by-step pattern to transform each input row into the corresponding output row.

To start, let's analyze the first two input rows and their corresponding output rows:

Input Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

From this initial pair, we can observe that the pattern consists of repeatedly adding 5 to each element in the input row, starting from the rightmost position (i.e., the last digit). Therefore, if we apply this pattern to the next input row, we should get the corresponding output row:

Input Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Now, let's continue applying the pattern to the remaining input rows and observing how it affects the output rows. Here's what we get:

Input Row 3: 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
Output Row 3: 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0

Input Row 4: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
Output Row 4: 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0

Input Row 5: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
Output Row 5: 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0

Input Row 6: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
Output Row 6: 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0

Input Row 7: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
Output Row 7: 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0

Input Row 8: 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
Output Row 8: 0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0

As you can see, the pattern repeats itself for each input row, adding 5 to each element in the row. This means that if we apply the same pattern to any other input row, we will get the same output row.

Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is to simply repeat the following steps for each input row:

1. Add 5 to each element in the input row.
2. Repeat step 1 until no more additions are needed.

By doing so, you will get the correct output row for each input row. Good job solving the puzzle!
