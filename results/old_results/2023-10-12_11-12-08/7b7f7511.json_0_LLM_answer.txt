LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the provided examples and identify the pattern in the output for each input.

Example 1:
Input: 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2
Output: 1, 1, 3, 2

Pattern observed: Each input value is either doubled or tripled before being placed in the output position.

Example 2:
Input: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
Output: 4, 4, 4

Pattern observed: All input values are equal and remain unchanged in the output position.

Example 3:
Input: 2, 3
Output: 2, 3

Pattern observed: No change in the input values occurs in the output position.

Example 4:
Input: 5, 4, 5
Output: 5, 4, 5

Pattern observed: The first two input values are swapped in the output position.

Based on these observations, we can create a general rule for the pattern:

Rule: If an input value is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it will be doubled in the output position. Otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input:

Test input: 5, 4, 5, 4, 6, 2

Using the rule above, we can determine the output values as follows:

Output: 10, 8, 5, 8, 12, 4

Therefore, the test output is 10, 8, 5, 8, 12, 4.
