LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down the pattern in each of the training examples:

Training Example 1:

* Input: 6, 2, 4, 2; Output: 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4
* Pattern: Each number is increased by 2 in both the x and y directions.

Training Example 2:

* Input: 5, 5, 9, 9; Output: 7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7
* Pattern: Each number is multiplied by 2 and then added to the previous number in the same position.

Training Example 3:

* Input: 3, 3, 5, 5; Output: 8, 5, 8, 8
* Pattern: Each number is doubled in value and moved one position to the right.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test Input: 8, 5, 7, 8

Using the pattern from Training Example 1, we get:

Output: 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4

Does this match the expected output?
