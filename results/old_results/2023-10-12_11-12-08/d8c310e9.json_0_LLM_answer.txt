LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to find a pattern in the input data that will produce a specific output for each input. In this case, the pattern appears to be a simple substitution cipher.

Here's how the cipher works:

* For each input row, replace each value with the corresponding value one position ahead of it in the row (i.e., if the value is 0, use the value directly after it; if the value is X, use the value directly before it).
* If the resulting value is greater than 9, wrap around to 0.

Using this rule, we can apply it to the test input:

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 =?

Well, let's see... starting from the leftmost column:

0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 0

So, the first value in the input row is replaced by the value directly after it, which is 1. Similarly, the second value is replaced by the value directly after it, which is 2, and so on.

Now, let's apply this process to the entire input row:

0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 0

And there you have it! The result of applying the cipher to the test input is:

4, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0

Great job! You've successfully solved the puzzle using the substitution cipher pattern.
