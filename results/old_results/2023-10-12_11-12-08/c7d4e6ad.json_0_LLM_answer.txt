[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to find a step-by-step pattern to transform each input row into the corresponding output row.

To start, let's analyze the first two input rows and their corresponding output rows:

Input Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

From this initial pair, we can observe that the pattern consists of adding a fixed value (in this case, 0) to each element of the input row, resulting in the corresponding output element. Specifically, the transformation rule for each element is:

Row[i] = Row[i] + 0

Now, let's apply this rule to the next input row:

Input Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Using the transformation rule we just derived, we can compute the output row as follows:

Output Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Repeating this process for each input row and applying the transformation rule yields the following output rows:

Test Output Row 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Test Output Row 2: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Continuing in this manner, we can generate the remaining output rows by applying the transformation rule to each input row. Here they are:

Test Output Rows 3-8:

Test Output Row 3: 3, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0
Test Output Row 4: 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0
Test Output Row 5: 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0
Test Output Row 6: 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0
Test Output Row 7: 7, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
Test Output Row 8: 8, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern to transform each input row into the corresponding output row is simply to add a fixed value (0) to each element of the input row, resulting in the corresponding output element.
