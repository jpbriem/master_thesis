LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have provided me with a set of input-output pairs for a classification problem. I will now use these examples to train a classifier and then apply it to your test input to predict the output.

Here's how I interpreted your input format:

* Each row represents an input feature vector.
* Each column represents a possible output value (class label).
* The values in each row represent the weights assigned to each class label based on the training data.

Now, let's proceed with the classification task:

Training Input:

| Feature Vector | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 0, 0, 0, 0 | 3 |
| 0, 0, 1, 0 | 3 |
| 0, 0, 1, 1 | 3 |
| 0, 0, 2, 0 | 3 |
| 0, 0, 2, 1 | 3 |
|... |... |

Test Input:

| Feature Vector |? |
| --- | --- |
| 0, 5, 0, 3 |? |
| 0, 0, 0, 1 |? |
| 1, 1, 1, 0 |? |
| 0, 0, 7, 0 |? |
| 0, 0, 0, 0 |? |
|... |... |

To classify the test input, we will use the trained model to compute the weighted sum of the input features for each class label. We will then compare the total weighted sum to determine which class label has the highest probability of being the correct output.

Please provide the next test input, and I will proceed with the classification.
