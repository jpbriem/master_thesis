[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems like you have a puzzle where you need to find a step-by-step pattern to transform an input into an output. The inputs and outputs are represented as rows of numbers, where each number represents a value between 0 and 9. You cannot perform any mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) on these numbers.

From the examples provided, I can see that the pattern involves shifting the input by one position to the right, and then replacing each value with the corresponding value in the next row of the input. For example, if the input is `4, 3`, the output would be `4, 3` because the first value in the output (`4`) is the same as the first value in the input (`4`), and the second value in the output (`3`) is the same as the third value in the input (`3`).

Here's how the pattern could be applied to the test input:
```
test input: 9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 9

Step 1: Shift the input by one position to the right, so the new input is:
9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 10

Step 2: Replace each value in the new input with the corresponding value in the next row of the input, so the output becomes:
9, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 9

Repeat this process for each row of the input until you reach the last row, which gives you the final output: `[9, 9, 9, 9]`.

Therefore, the output for the test input is `[9, 9, 9, 9]`.
