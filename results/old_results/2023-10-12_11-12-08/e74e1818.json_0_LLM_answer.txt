LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle to solve. Here's how I can help you:

From the information provided, it appears that each row in the input represents a set of values, and each column represents an operation (either addition or multiplication) that should be applied to those values. The goal is to determine the correct operation for each value in the input based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

To start, let's analyze the first two rows of the input:
```css
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
```
In the first row, we have six values of 0, which means that no operation should be performed on these values. In the second row, we have three values of 2, which means that we should perform addition twice (i.e., 2 + 2 = 4).

Now, let's apply this pattern to the remaining rows of the input:

Row 3: We have four values of 0, so no operation should be performed. Row 4: We have three values of 4, so we should perform addition three times (i.e., 4 + 4 = 8).

By continuing this process, we can determine the operations that should be performed on each value in the input based on the patterns observed in the training examples. Once we have determined the operations for all values, we can apply them to get the output for the test input.

Here's the output for the test input:
```css
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
