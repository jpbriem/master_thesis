LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided me with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into a desired output. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

Step 1: Identify the transformation rule

The first step is to identify the transformation rule that is applied to the input to produce the output. In this case, the transformation rule seems to be simple addition, where each element in the input is added by a fixed value (either 0 or 8).

Step 2: Apply the transformation rule to the input

Once you have identified the transformation rule, apply it to the input to produce the output. In this case, you can simply add the fixed value to each element in the input to obtain the output.

Here's an example of how you can apply the transformation rule to the input:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Transformation rule: Add 8 to each element.

Output: 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

Step 3: Repeat the process for multiple inputs

Repeat steps 1 and 2 for multiple inputs to obtain their corresponding outputs. Make sure to apply the transformation rule to each input in the same way to ensure consistency.

For example, if you want to apply the transformation rule to the following input:

Input: 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

You would first identify the transformation rule (add 8 to each element) and then apply it to the input to obtain the output:

Output: 0, 16, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

By repeating these steps for multiple inputs, you can solve the puzzle and determine the transformation rule that is being used to transform the inputs into outputs.
