LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to identify a step-by-step pattern in the input data that can be applied to generate the corresponding output values.

From the examples provided, we can observe that each input row consists of two types of values: "0"s and non-zero values. Moreover, the non-zero values always appear in pairs, either both equal to 2 or both equal to 0.

Here's a possible step-by-step pattern that could be used to generate the output values for a given input:

1. If there are any non-zero values in the input row, pair them up and set their product to 2.
2. Set all remaining values in the row to 0.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

Input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0

Step 1: Pair up the non-zero values (0, 7) and set their product to 2:
2 Ã— 7 = 14

Step 2: Set all remaining values to 0:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Output: 14, 14, 14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Repeat this process for the rest of the input rows, and you should obtain the same output values as shown above.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
