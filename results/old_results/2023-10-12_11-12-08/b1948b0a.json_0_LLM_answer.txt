LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each set of inputs is to shift one position to the right and then add the value of the top row to the bottom row. Here's how it works:

1. Shift the first row of the input by one position to the right, so that the new first row becomes the second row of the input.
2. Add the value of the top row (the first row after shifting) to the bottom row of the input.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each subsequent row of the input.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input:
6, 7, 7, 6
6, 7, 6, 7
7, 7, 7, 6
7, 6, 7, 6

Shift the first row by one position to the right:

Input after shifting:
6, 7, 8, 6
6, 7, 7, 7
7, 7, 8, 6
7, 6, 7, 6

Add the value of the top row (the first row after shifting) to the bottom row of the input:

Output:
4, 5, 6, 4
4, 5, 7, 5
6, 7, 8, 6
6, 5, 7, 6

Therefore, the test output is [4, 5, 6, 4].
