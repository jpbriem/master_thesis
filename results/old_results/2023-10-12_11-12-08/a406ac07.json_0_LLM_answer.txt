LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've provided us with a puzzle that involves identifying a step-by-step pattern to transform a given input into a corresponding output. Let's analyze the training examples you provided:

1. Input: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9`
Output: `9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9`

From this example, we can see that each row of the input corresponds to a column of the output. Moreover, each value in the input is either increased by 1 or left unchanged when transformed into the corresponding output value. Therefore, the pattern we need to identify is:

Increment by 1 if the input value is non-zero.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3`

Using the same logic as before, we can transform each input value into the corresponding output value:

Input: `0` -> Output: `0` (unchanged)
Input: `0` -> Output: `0` (unchanged)
Input: `0` -> Output: `0` (unchanged)
Input: `0` -> Output: `4` (incremented by 1)
Input: `0` -> Output: `4` (incremented by 1)
Input: `0` -> Output: `4` (incremented by 1)
Input: `0` -> Output: `3` (decreased by 1)

Therefore, the output for the test input is:

`0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3`

Great! We have successfully solved the puzzle.
