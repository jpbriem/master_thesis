[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Based on the instructions you provided, it seems that the goal is to find a step-by-step process to transform each input row into its corresponding output row.

To start, let's analyze the first two examples:

Example 1:
Input: 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 2, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 2

From this example, we can observe that the transformation involves adding a fixed value (in this case, 2) to each element of the input row, except for the last element, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the step-by-step process to transform the input row into the output row could be:

1. Add 2 to the first element of the input row.
2. Add 2 to the second element of the input row.
3. Add 2 to the third element of the input row.
4. Add 2 to the fourth element of the input row.
5. Add 2 to the fifth element of the input row.
6. Add 2 to the sixth element of the input row.
7. Leave the seventh element of the input row unchanged.

Using this process, we can transform any input row into its corresponding output row. Let's apply this process to the test input:

Test input: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2

Step 1: Add 2 to the first element of the input row, giving us 2.
Step 2: Add 2 to the second element of the input row, giving us 3.
Step 3: Add 2 to the third element of the input row, giving us 4.
Step 4: Add 2 to the fourth element of the input row, giving us 6.
Step 5: Add 2 to the fifth element of the input row, giving us 8.
Step 6: Leave the sixth element of the input row unchanged, giving us 2.

Therefore, the transformed test input is:

Transformed test input: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2

Now, let's apply this process to the remaining test inputs:

Test input: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2
Transformed test input: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2

Test input: 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 0
Transformed test input: 4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4

Test input: 0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0
Transformed test input: 4, 8, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4

Test input: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0
Transformed test input: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2, 0

Test input: 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
Transformed test input: 4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0, 0

Test input: 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0
Transformed test input: 4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0, 0

Test input: 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4
Transformed test input: 6, 8, 0, 6, 8, 0, 4

Test input: 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
Transformed test input: 4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0, 0

Based on these transformations, we can conclude that the step-by-step process to transform each input row into its corresponding output row is as follows:

1. Add 2 to the first element of the input row.
2. Add 2 to the second element of the input row.
3. Add 2 to the third element of the input row.
4. Add 2 to the fourth element of the input row.
