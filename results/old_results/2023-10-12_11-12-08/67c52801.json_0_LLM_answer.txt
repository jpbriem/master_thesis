[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're ready to solve the puzzle. Here's how you can identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from the input:

In each row of the input, there are two types of values:

* Values that are always zero (indicated by `0` in the output). These values do not affect the output.
* Values that are either five or six (indicated by `5` or `6` in the output). These values determine whether a value in the corresponding position in the output is zero or non-zero.

The pattern for getting the output from the input is as follows:

1. Start with the first row of the input.
2. If the value in the first position is five, set the corresponding value in the output to zero. Otherwise, set it to one.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each position in the row, using the value in the previous position as the basis for determining whether to set the current position to zero or one.
4. Move on to the next row of the input and repeat steps 2-3.
5. Continue this process until all rows of the input have been processed.

Here's an example of how this pattern would work for the input:

Input:
2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Output:
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

Explanation:

* In the first row, the value in the first position is five, so we set the corresponding value in the output to zero.
* In the second row, the value in the first position is also five, so we set the corresponding value in the output to zero again.
* In the third row, the value in the first position is zero, so we set the corresponding value in the output to one.
* In the fourth row, the value in the first position is six, so we set the corresponding value in the output to one.
* In the fifth row, the value in the first position is zero, so we set the corresponding value in the output to zero.

By following this pattern, you can generate the output for any input provided. Good luck!
