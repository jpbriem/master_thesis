[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these puzzles involves manipulating the input values in a specific way to produce the corresponding output values. Here's how I would approach this problem:

1. Observe that each input value is either 0 or 8.
2. Notice that when an input value is 0, it is always followed by another 0.
3. When an input value is 8, it is always followed by a 0.
4. Also observe that there are no modular operations (e.g., addition or subtraction) involved in the puzzle.
5. Given these observations, we can start applying simple transformations to the input values to generate the output values. For example, if the input is 0, we can simply add 0 to it to get the output value. If the input is 8, we can subtract 0 to get the output value.
6. To handle the cases where the input value is neither 0 nor 8, we can use a combination of these simple transformations. For instance, if the input is 4, we can first subtract 0 to get 4, then add 0 to get the output value of 2.
7. Finally, we can apply these transformations to the test input to get the test output.

Here are the steps I would take to solve the test input:

Test input: 0, 0, 8, 0, 0

Step 1: Observe that the input value 0 is followed by another 0.
Step 2: Apply the transformation rule for input value 0: add 0 to get the output value 0.
Step 3: Observe that the input value 8 is followed by a 0.
Step 4: Apply the transformation rule for input value 8: subtract 0 to get the output value 8.
Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining input values.

Output: 0, 0, 8, 0, 0

Therefore, the step-by-step pattern for solving these puzzles is to observe the input values, apply the appropriate transformation rules, and repeat the process until the output values are obtained.
