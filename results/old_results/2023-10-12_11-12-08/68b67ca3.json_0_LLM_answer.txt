LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these puzzles involves manipulating the input values in a specific way to produce the corresponding output values. Here's how I would approach this problem:

Step 1: Identify the basic operation(s) involved in each example

From the first example, we can see that the operation involved is simply adding the values in each row. Therefore, the basic operation for this puzzle is "add".

For the second example, we can observe that the values in each row are being multiplied by a constant factor (in this case, 2). So, the basic operation for this puzzle is "multiply".

For the third example, we can see that the values in each row are being shifted by a certain number of positions (in this case, 1). So, the basic operation for this puzzle is "shift".

Step 2: Apply the identified operation to the test input

Using the operations identified above, we can now apply them to the test input to obtain the test output. For example:

Test input: 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0

We know that the basic operation for this puzzle is "shift", so we will apply it to the test input as follows:

Shift the values in each row by 1 position:

New row 1: 3 + 0 = 3
New row 2: 0 + 0 = 0
New row 3: 3 + 0 = 3
New row 4: 0 + 0 = 0
New row 5: 4 + 0 = 4
New row 6: 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the test output for this puzzle is:

[3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0]

By repeating this process for each row in the test input, we can determine the correct output for the entire puzzle.
