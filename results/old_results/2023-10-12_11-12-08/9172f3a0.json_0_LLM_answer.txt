[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of numbers, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9. The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking. Do not sum them or modulo them or calculate with them.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I understand that the task is to identify the step-by-step pattern used to transform the input into the corresponding output. It seems like the pattern involves repeatedly applying a simple operation (either adding a fixed value or setting a value to a fixed value) to each element of the input until the output is reached.

To solve this problem, I will use a combination of brute force and logical reasoning to determine the operation being applied and the number of times it is being applied for each input.

For the first example, we have:

Input: 3, 3, 0
Output: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0

From the output, we can see that the operation being applied is either adding 3 or setting a value to 3. Let's try both possibilities:

* If the operation is adding 3, then the input would become: 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 0 = 6, 6 + 0 = 6,...
* If the operation is setting a value to 3, then the input would become: 3, 3, 0, 0, 0,...

Since the output has repeating patterns of 3s, it seems likely that the operation is setting a value to 3. Therefore, the pattern for the first example is: set the value to 3.

Now let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: 0, 1, 0

Using the same logic as before, we can see that the operation being applied is either adding 1 or setting a value to 1. Let's try both possibilities:

* If the operation is adding 1, then the input would become: 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1,...
* If the operation is setting a value to 1, then the input would become: 0, 1, 0,...

Since the output has repeating patterns of 1s, it seems likely that the operation is setting a value to 1. Therefore, the pattern for the second example is: set the value to 1.

I hope this helps you solve the puzzle! Can you please provide me with the next example?
