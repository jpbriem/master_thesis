LLM answer:

?,?,?,?
\end{code}

This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of the game Tic-Tac-Toe being played. The first line of each example specifies the current state of the board (represented as a list of integers), and the second line specifies the move made by the player (represented as a single integer). The third line specifies the new state of the board after the move has been made.

The first example shows a game being played with the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, where the player chooses to place their mark (either 'X' or 'O') in the center square. The second example shows a game being played with a modified set of rules, where the player can only choose to place their mark on the corners of the board.

The third example shows a game being played with another modified set of rules, where certain squares are designated as "power squares" and give the player who places their mark there a bonus. In this case, the player chooses to place their mark on a power square, which gives them two marks instead of one.

The fourth example shows a game being played with yet another modified set of rules, where some squares are designated as "blocking squares" and cannot be used by either player. In this case, the player tries to place their mark on a blocking square, but it is blocked by the other player's previous move.

Finally, the last line of the notebook specifies a test input for the AI agent being trained, and asks for the expected output (i.e., the move that the AI agent should make in response to the given input).
