I'm trying to use the `fit()` method on a neural network to learn from this data and make predictions on new examples. However, I keep getting an error message that says "shape too large". I've tried reshaping the data in various ways, but nothing seems to work. Can you help me figure out what's going wrong?

Answer: The issue is likely due to the fact that your training data contains batches with different shapes. In particular, the last example in your training data has a shape of `(7, 10)` while the others have a shape of `(6, 10)`. This causes issues when trying to create a dataset from the data, as the batch size must be consistent across all examples.

To fix this, you can either:

1. Pad the last example with an additional column of zeros to match the shape of the other examples:
```scss
train_data = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],
                      [4, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0],
                      [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2],
                      [6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6],
                      [6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6]])
```
Or,
2. Split the last example into two separate examples, each with a shape of `(6, 10)`:
```scss
train_data = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],
                      [4, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0],
                      [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2],
                      [6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6],
                      [6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6],
                      [6, 2, 2, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0, 6],
                      [6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6]])
```
Once you've made one of these changes, you should be able to create a dataset from the data and train your model without any issues.
