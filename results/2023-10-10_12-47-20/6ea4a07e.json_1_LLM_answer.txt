In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs for the function we want to learn. Each example consists of three inputs (represented as integers) and three corresponding outputs (also represented as integers). The goal is to learn a function that can take in three integers as input and produce three integers as output, based on the patterns observed in the training data.

The first line of the file specifies the number of training examples, which is 6 in this case. Each training example is represented in the format "input: output", where input and output are separated by a colon. For example, the first training example has input 8, 0, 0 and output 0, 2, 2. This means that when the input is 8, 0, 0, the output should be 0, 2, 2.

After the training examples, there is a single line indicating the end of the training data ("End of example"). Then, there is a single test example, represented in the same format as the training examples, but with the label "test" instead of "train". In this case, the test example has input 0, 5, 0 and output?,?,?, indicating that we don't know the correct output for this input.

Your task is to write a program that can read this file and learn a function that can correctly predict the output for the given input. You can use any programming language or machine learning library you prefer. Once you have trained your model, you can use it to predict the output for the test input and print the result.
