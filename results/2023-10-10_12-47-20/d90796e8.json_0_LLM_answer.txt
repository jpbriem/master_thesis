This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of MNIST data, which is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The data consists of 784 pixels per image, and each pixel has a value between 0 and 1. The task is to classify the images into one of 10 classes (0-9).

The notebook provides three examples of MNIST data, with the input data followed by the corresponding output labels. The input data is represented as a matrix, where each row corresponds to a single pixel in the image, and each column corresponds to a single pixel in the digit. For example, the first row of the first input matrix represents the values of the pixels in the first row of the image, from left to right.

The output labels are also represented as a matrix, where each row corresponds to a single class label. For example, the first row of the first output matrix represents the class label for the first image, which is a 0.

The notebook also includes a test set, which can be used to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data.
