I'm trying to use the `keras.Sequential` model and compile it with a loss function and an optimizer, but I keep getting errors. Here is my code so far:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import numpy as np

# Load data
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

X = train_data.drop(['output'], axis=1)
y = train_data['output']

# One-hot encode output
encoder = LabelEncoder()
y_onehot = encoder.fit_transform(y)

# Define model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X, y_onehot, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```
The error message I get is:
```
ValueError: Error when checking target: expected dense_3 to have shape (8,) but got array with shape (1, 8)
```
I don't understand why this is happening since I've already one-hot encoded the output variable and it has shape `(1793, 8)`. Can someone please help me resolve this issue?

Answer: The error message you see suggests that the target shape of your model is not consistent with the shape of the output of the last layer.

You have defined the last layer of your model as `Dense(8, activation='softmax')`, which means that the output of this layer will have shape `(batch_size, 8)`, where `batch_size` is the size of the mini-batch.

However, when you call `model.fit()`, you pass `y_onehot` as the target, which has shape `(1793, 8)`, where `1793` is the number of samples in your training set. This means that the target shape of your model does not match the shape of the output of the last layer.

To fix this issue, you can either:

1. Change the last layer of your model to `Dense(8, activation='softmax', output_shape=(8,))`, which will force the output of the last layer to have shape `(8,)` instead of `(batch_size, 8)`.
2. Reshape the target `y_onehot` to have shape `(1793, 1)` before passing it to `model.fit()`. You can do this by calling `y_onehot = y_onehot.reshape((-1, 1))`.

Either of these changes should allow you to train your model without encountering the shape mismatch error.
