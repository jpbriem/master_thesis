This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples and tests for a neural network that can recognize 3D objects from a set of 2D images. The notebook uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits, but the concepts and techniques demonstrated could be applied to other datasets as well.

The first cell in the notebook imports the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy. The second cell defines a function called `load_data` that loads the MNIST dataset and preprocesses the data by reshaping it into batches of 2D arrays with shape `(1, 28, 28)` and labels with shape `(1, 10)`.

The third cell defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using Keras, with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers. The fourth cell trains the CNN on the MNIST dataset using the `fit` method, and the fifth cell evaluates the model's performance on a test set using the `evaluate` method.

The sixth cell defines a new function called `recognize_objects`, which takes a list of 2D images as input and applies the trained CNN to each image. The seventh cell demonstrates how to use the `recognize_objects` function to classify a set of handwritten digits.

The eighth cell starts a new section of the notebook, labeled "Test", and provides a sample input and output for the `recognize_objects` function. The remaining cells in this section provide additional examples and tests for the function.
