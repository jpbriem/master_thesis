I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example with a positive label (2) in the last column, while all other examples have a negative label (0). This imbalance in the data can cause problems for the model during training, as it may become overly specialized to the single positive example and fail to generalize well to new data.

To address this issue, there are several possible approaches you could try:

1. Balance the data: You could balance the data by either oversampling the minority class (in this case, the positive labels) or undersampling the majority class (the negative labels). Oversampling can be done by creating additional instances of the minority class, while undersampling can be done by randomly removing instances from the majority class.
2. Use class weights: Another approach is to use class weights when training the model. Class weights allow you to assign different weights to each class during training, so that the model pays more attention to the minority class. You can set the weight of the minority class to a higher value than the majority class to compensate for the imbalance.
3. Use cost-sensitive learning: Cost-sensitive learning allows you to assign different costs to misclassification errors for different classes. In your case, you could assign a higher cost to misclassifying a positive example as negative, since this would result in a false negative. By doing so, the model will be penalized more heavily for misclassifying positive examples, which should improve its performance on the minority class.
4. Try different models: Finally, you could also try using different machine learning models that are better suited for imbalanced datasets, such as random forests or support vector machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel. These models tend to be less sensitive to class imbalances and may perform better on your dataset.

I hope these suggestions help you resolve the issue you are experiencing with your machine learning model. Good luck!
