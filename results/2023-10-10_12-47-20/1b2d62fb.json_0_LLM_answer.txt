This is a classic problem of determining the rules for a simple binary classification task using a perceptron learning algorithm. The goal is to learn a linear boundary that separates the two classes in the input space.

The training data consists of five examples, each with seven input features (0/1) and one output feature (0/8). The task is to learn a linear function that maps the input features to the output feature.

The first step is to preprocess the data by normalizing the input features to have zero mean and unit variance. This is necessary because the perceptron learning rule relies on the gradient of the error function, which is sensitive to the scale of the input variables.

Next, we need to choose a learning rate for the perceptron learning rule. A common choice is to start with a relatively high learning rate and gradually decrease it as the training progresses.

Once the learning rate is chosen, we can apply the perceptron learning rule to update the weights for each example in the training set. The learning rule states that the weight update is proportional to the error between the predicted output and the true output. The proportionality constant is the learning rate.

After updating the weights for all examples, we repeat the process until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.

In this case, the training data contains five examples, and the output values are either 0 or 8. Inspecting the data, we can see that the decision boundary should be horizontal, separating the two classes.

Using a spreadsheet or programming language, we can implement the perceptron learning algorithm and plot the decision boundary after each iteration. With a suitable learning rate, the algorithm should converge to the correct decision boundary after a few iterations.
