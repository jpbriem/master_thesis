This is a classic problem in artificial intelligence and machine learning called the "traffic Light Problem" or "Traffic Signal Control Problem". The goal is to find a policy that can control the traffic lights at an intersection so that the cars can pass through the intersection without colliding with each other.

The input to the model is a sequence of binary vectors where each element in the vector represents the presence or absence of a car on a particular lane. For example, if there are three lanes, then the input would be a vector of length 3 where a 1 indicates a car is present on that lane and a 0 indicates no car is present.

The output of the model is also a sequence of binary vectors where each element in the vector represents the color of the traffic light on a particular lane. A 1 means the light is green and a 0 means it's red.

The objective is to learn a policy that maps inputs to outputs such that the cars can cross the intersection safely without any accidents.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
