This is a classic problem of sequence prediction using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The input sequence consists of 8 binary values, and the task is to predict the next value in the sequence. The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.

To solve this problem, you can use an RNN architecture such as LSTM or GRU, with a single layer and a softmax output layer. You can also experiment with different architectures, such as adding more layers or using a different number of cells in the LSTM/GRU layer.

Here are some tips for training the model:

1. Use a sufficient number of epochs (e.g., 50-100) to ensure that the model converges properly.
2. Use a learning rate schedule to adjust the learning rate during training, starting with a high initial value and decreasing it gradually.
3. Use techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden units, the number of layers, and the learning rate schedule.
5. Use early stopping to stop training when the validation loss stops improving.
6. Use techniques such as gradient clipping and weight regularization to prevent exploding gradients and improve generalization.
7. Use a suitable optimization algorithm, such as Adam or SGD, to optimize the loss function.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
