In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs for the function we want to learn. Each example consists of three inputs (represented as integers) and three corresponding outputs (also represented as integers). The goal is to learn a function that can take in three integers as input and produce three integers as output, based on the patterns observed in the training data.

The first line of the file specifies the number of training examples, which is 6 in this case. Each training example is represented as a set of input-output pairs, separated by a blank line. For instance, the first training example consists of the input values 8, 0, 0 and the output values 0, 2, 2. The second training example has input values 0, 8, 0 and output values 1, 1, 0, and so on.

After the training examples, there are two lines indicating the end of the training data and the start of the test data. The test data consists of a single example with input values 3, 0, 0 and unknown output values, represented by question marks.

Your task is to write a program that can read this file, learn the underlying pattern in the training data, and then use that knowledge to predict the output values for the test data. You can assume that the input and output values are always non-negative integers, and that the function we want to learn is a mapping from three integers to three integers.
