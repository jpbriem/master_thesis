This is an IPython notebook that contains a single test case for the game of Hex. The test case consists of four examples, each with a set of inputs and expected outputs. The goal of the game is to guess the missing value in the input grid based on the given constraints.

The first example has a 3x3 grid with some numbers filled in. The task is to fill in the missing number so that no three consecutive cells in any row, column, or diagonal contain the same number. The expected output for this example is 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0.

The second example has a 4x4 grid with some numbers filled in. The task is to fill in the missing numbers so that no three consecutive cells in any row, column, or diagonal contain the same number. The expected output for this example is 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0.

The third example has a 4x4 grid with some numbers filled in. The task is to fill in the missing numbers so that no three consecutive cells in any row, column, or diagonal contain the same number. The expected output for this example is 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5.

The fourth example has a 4x4 grid with some numbers filled in. The task is to fill in the missing numbers so that no three consecutive cells in any row, column, or diagonal contain the same number. The expected output for this example is 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5.

The test case ends with a test input and expected output for the game of Hex. The goal is to fill in the missing values in the input grid so that no three consecutive cells in any row, column, or diagonal contain the same number.
