In this case we can see that the model is able to learn the simple logic of the XOR gate, as it's able to correctly predict the output for the test inputs.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example and in real-world scenarios the data might be much more complex and noisy, and the model may require more sophisticated architecture and regularization techniques to generalize well.
