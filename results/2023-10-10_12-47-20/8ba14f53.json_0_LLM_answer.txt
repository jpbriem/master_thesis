This is an IPython notebook that contains a dataset for training and testing a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset consists of 28x28 images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is represented as a 28x28 matrix of binary pixels (0/1) representing the presence or absence of a digit in each position. The task is to classify the digit into one of the 10 classes (0-9).

The notebook also includes some preprocessing steps to normalize the pixel values and split the data into training and testing sets. Additionally, it defines a simple neural network architecture with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, and trains the model on the training set using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function. Finally, it evaluates the model's performance on the test set and displays the results.
