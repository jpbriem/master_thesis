This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates a simple neural network with one hidden layer and a softmax output layer. The network takes in 9 inputs and outputs a probability distribution over 9 classes. The training data consists of 9 examples, each with 9 inputs and corresponding outputs. The test data consists of 1 example with 9 inputs.

The code first imports the necessary libraries: NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. It then defines the structure of the neural network using the `neural_network` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. This function takes in the number of inputs, hidden units, and outputs, as well as the activation functions for the hidden and output layers. In this case, the activation functions are chosen to be the sigmoid function for the hidden layer and the softmax function for the output layer.

Next, the code defines the training and test data using numpy arrays. The training data consists of 9 examples, each with 9 inputs and corresponding outputs. The test data consists of 1 example with 9 inputs.

The code then uses the `neural_network` function to train the network on the training data. It iterates through each example in the training data, feeding the inputs into the network and adjusting the weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the true outputs.

Finally, the code tests the trained network on the test data, printing out the predicted probabilities for each class.

Note that this is just a simple example to demonstrate the basic concept of a neural network. In practice, you would need to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and perform other tasks to prepare the data for training. Additionally, the choice of architecture, hyperparameters, and optimization algorithms can have a significant impact on performance, so it's important to experiment and evaluate different configurations to find the best approach for your specific problem.
