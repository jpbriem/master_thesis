I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. Can you help me?

Answer: It looks like the issue is with the encoding of the data. The training and testing data are encoded differently, which is causing issues when trying to read them into Python.

The training data appears to be encoded as a binary file, where each byte represents a single digit in the input data. For example, the first four bytes of the training data represent the number 0, 0, 0, 0, which corresponds to the first four inputs of the neural network.

On the other hand, the testing data appears to be encoded as a text file, where each line represents a single input vector for the neural network. Each element of the input vector is separated by a space, and the elements are listed in order from left to right.

To fix the issue, you will need to modify the code that reads in the training and testing data to account for the different encodings. Here's an example of how you could do this:

# Load training data
with open('training_data', 'rb') as f:
    # Read in the training data as a binary file
    training_data = np.fromfile(f, dtype=np.uint8)

# Load testing data
with open('testing_data', 'r') as f:
    # Read in the testing data as a text file
    testing_data = np.array([line.split() for line in f])

Once you have loaded the data correctly, you should be able to use it to train and test your neural network without any further issues.
