\end{code}

The training data consists of five examples, and the test data consists of four examples. Each example in both the training and test data is a sequence of 16 binary digits (0s and 1s) representing a pattern of 4 bits (0s and 1s) repeated 4 times. The task is to predict the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) of the pattern based on the first 12 bits (0s and 1s).

In the training data, the first 4 bits (0s and 1s) of each pattern are always 0, and the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) are either 0, 2, 4, or 8. The second-to-last 4 bits (0s and 1s) are either 0, 2, 4, or 8, and they are always equal to the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) minus 2. The third-to-last 4 bits (0s and 1s) are either 0, 2, 4, or 8, and they are always equal to the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) minus 4. The fourth-to-last 4 bits (0s and 1s) are either 0, 2, 4, or 8, and they are always equal to the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) minus 6.

In the test data, the patterns are similar to the training data, but there are some differences. The first 4 bits (0s and 1s) are not always 0, and the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) can be any combination of 0s and 1s, including all 0s or all 1s.

Your goal is to write a program that can predict the last 4 bits (0s and 1s) of a given pattern based on the first 12 bits (0s and 1s). You can use any programming language you like, and you can assume that the input and output are binary strings (strings of 0s and 1s).
