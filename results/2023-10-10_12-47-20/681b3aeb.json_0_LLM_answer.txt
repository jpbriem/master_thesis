This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the game Tic-Tac-Toe being played out in a text format. The first line of each example is the current state of the board, represented as a list of 9 integers representing the cells of the board (0 for empty, 1 for X, and 2 for O). The second line is the move made by the player whose turn it is (X or O), represented as a list of 3 integers giving the row, column, and value to be placed in that cell. The third line is the new state of the board after the move has been made.

The first example shows a simple game where X wins by getting three in a row. The second example shows a game where O wins by getting three in a row. The third example shows a game where neither player wins, as all of the cells are filled up without any player getting three in a row.

In the test input section, there are four test cases for you to solve. Your task is to write a function that takes in the current state of the board and the move made by the player, and returns the new state of the board after the move has been made. You should return the new state of the board as a list of 9 integers, with the rows and columns ordered in the same way as the original representation.

For each test case, you will need to fill in the missing values in the output section with the correct values. For example, in the first test case, the output should be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], since the initial state of the board is entirely empty. In the second test case, the output should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], since the final state of the board is entirely filled with ones.
