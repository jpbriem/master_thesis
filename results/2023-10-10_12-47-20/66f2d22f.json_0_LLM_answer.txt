LLM answer:

?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?
\end{code}

This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the MNIST dataset, which is a popular image classification benchmark. The notebook includes both training and test data, with inputs represented as 784-dimensional vectors (28x28 images) and outputs represented as 10-dimensional vectors (10 classes).

The notebook first loads the MNIST dataset using the `numpy` library and then splits it into training and test sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. It then creates a simple neural network classifier using the `keras` library and trains it on the training set. Finally, it tests the trained model on the test set and displays the predicted outputs.

Note that this is just one possible way to load and use the MNIST dataset in Python, and there are many other ways to do so depending on your specific needs and requirements.
