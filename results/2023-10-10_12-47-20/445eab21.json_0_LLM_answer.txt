This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of MNIST data, which is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The notebook includes both training and test data, with the goal of using machine learning algorithms to recognize the digits in the images.

The first section of the notebook provides some information about the MNIST dataset and how it can be used for machine learning. The next section shows an example of how to load the MNIST data into memory using the `numpy` library.

The following sections provide examples of how to preprocess the data, including resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the data into training and test sets. These sections also demonstrate how to create a simple neural network using the `keras` library and train it on the MNIST data.

The final section of the notebook provides an example of how to use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. Overall, this notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to using MNIST data for handwritten digit recognition and demonstrates several key concepts in machine learning.
