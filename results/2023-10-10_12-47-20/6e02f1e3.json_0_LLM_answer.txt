In this example, the neural network is trained on a set of five input-output pairs, where each input is a vector of three integers, and each output is a vector of three integers. The goal is to learn a mapping from input vectors to output vectors that can be used to predict the output for a given input.

The training data consists of five examples, each with an input vector and a corresponding output vector. For example, the first input vector is [2, 2, 2], and the corresponding output vector is [5, 0, 0]. The second input vector is [3, 2, 3], and the corresponding output vector is [0, 5, 0].

After training the network on these five examples, it is tested on a single input vector [4, 4, 4], and the predicted output vector is [5, 0, 0]. This shows that the network has learned a mapping from input vectors to output vectors that can be used to make predictions on new input data.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example, and in practice, neural networks are often trained on much larger datasets and used for more complex tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
