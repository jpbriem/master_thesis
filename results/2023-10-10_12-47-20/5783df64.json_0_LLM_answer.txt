In this case we have a neural network with one hidden layer containing 12 neurons (the number of inputs is 7, and the number of outputs is also 7). The training data consists of three examples, each with 7 input values and 7 corresponding output values.

The first example has an input vector of [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7], which should be mapped to an output vector of [6, 4, 7]. The second example has an input vector of [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], which should be mapped to an output vector of [2, 3, 9]. The third example has an input vector of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], which should be mapped to an output vector of [1, 5, 8].

The test data consists of four examples, each with 7 input values and 7 corresponding output values. The first example has an input vector of [2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which should be mapped to an output vector of [2, 1, 7]. The second example has an input vector of [0, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0], which should be mapped to an output vector of [3, 5, 9]. The third example has an input vector of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which should be mapped to an output vector of [1, 0, 0]. The fourth example has an input vector of [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which should be mapped to an output vector of [4, 6, 8].
