I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. With only 5 examples, the model has 64 parameters (2*4*4) and this leads to overfitting.

To address this, you can try reducing the number of parameters by reducing the number of hidden layers or the size of the hidden layers. You can also try regularization techniques such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.

Another approach would be to use a smaller neural network architecture such as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a single hidden layer. This would reduce the number of parameters and make the model less prone to overfitting.

You can also try using early stopping to stop training when the validation loss stops improving. This will prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model has a chance to fit the noise in the training data.

Lastly, you can try using a different optimization algorithm such as Adam or RMSprop instead of SGD. These algorithms have built-in mechanisms for adjusting learning rate and can help avoid getting stuck in local minima.
