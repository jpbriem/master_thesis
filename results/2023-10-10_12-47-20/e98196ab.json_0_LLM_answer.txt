This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a simple neural network with two inputs, three hidden units, and one output. The network is trained on a dataset of six examples, and it is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first cell imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
2. The second cell defines the function `build_model`, which creates a Sequential model using the Keras functional API. The model has two inputs, three hidden layers with 32 units each, and one output. The activation function for the hidden layers is ReLU, and the output layer uses a sigmoid activation function by default.
3. The third cell defines the function `compile_model`, which compiles the model with a loss function and an optimizer. In this case, the loss function is binary cross-entropy, and the optimizer is Adam.
4. The fourth cell trains the model on a dataset of six examples. Each example consists of a row of six input values and a corresponding output value. The inputs are flattened into a vector before being passed to the model.
5. The fifth cell tests the model on a separate test set of six examples. Again, each example consists of a row of six input values and a corresponding output value. The predicted output values are compared to the actual output values to demonstrate the accuracy of the model.
6. Finally, the sixth cell plots the training and testing errors and losses over the course of training. This shows how the model improves in accuracy as it learns from the training data.
