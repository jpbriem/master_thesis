This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a simple neural network that can solve a specific problem. The problem is to given a sequence of 3 integers (x, y, z), output the maximum value in the sequence.

The first cell in the notebook imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy and Keras. The second cell defines a function called `max_value` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list.

The third cell creates a synthetic dataset consisting of input sequences of length 3, along with corresponding output values (the maximum value in each sequence). This data is used to train the neural network.

The fourth cell uses the Keras functional API to define a neural network model that consists of three layers: an input layer with 3 neurons, two hidden layers with 128 neurons each, and an output layer with 1 neuron. The activation functions for each layer are specified using the `activation` argument.

The fifth cell compiles the model with a loss function and an optimizer, and then trains it on the synthetic dataset using the `fit` method.

The sixth cell tests the trained model on a separate test set, and prints the predicted outputs alongside the actual maxima in the test set.

Finally, the seventh cell uses the trained model to make predictions on new input sequences of length 3.
