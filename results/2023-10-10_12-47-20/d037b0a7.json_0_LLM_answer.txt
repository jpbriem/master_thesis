The `train` and `test` sections are separated by a blank line, and each example is also separated by a blank line. The format of the input and output is the same as in the previous problem.

Your task is to write a program that can solve this problem. You can use any programming language you like, but you should try to solve it using only the standard library and no external libraries. You can also assume that the input and output formats will always be the same (i.e., a list of integers separated by spaces).

Here's an example of how you might approach this problem:

1. First, read the input data from the file and split it into a list of examples.
2. For each example, split the input into three parts: the first number (which represents the row), the second number (which represents the column), and the third number (which represents the value).
3. Use a nested loop to iterate over the rows and columns of the grid, and for each cell, check if the value is zero. If it is, set it to the minimum of the values in the row and column. Otherwise, set it to the maximum of the values in the row and column.
4. After all cells have been updated, print the final values of the grid.

This is just one possible way to solve the problem, and there may be other approaches that are more efficient or easier to implement. Can you solve this problem using the described method?
