As you can see, the training data consists of a series of input vectors and corresponding output vectors. The goal is to learn a mapping from the input space to the output space such that when given a new input vector, the model can predict the corresponding output vector.

In this case, it seems like the model is supposed to learn a simple mapping from a 5-dimensional input space to a 5-dimensional output space. The inputs are all 5-dimensional vectors with values in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and the outputs are also 5-dimensional vectors with values in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

The training data contains three examples, each consisting of an input vector and a corresponding output vector. The first example has an input vector [2, 1, 4] and an output vector [2, 1, 4]; the second example has an input vector [5, 5, 5] and an output vector [5, 5, 5]; and the third example has an input vector [8, 3] and an output vector [8, 8].

It's worth noting that the training data is quite limited - there are only three examples, and they all have very similar input and output vectors. This means that the model won't have much information to learn from, and it may not be able to generalize well to new input vectors. In practice, you would typically need many more examples to train a reliable machine learning model.
