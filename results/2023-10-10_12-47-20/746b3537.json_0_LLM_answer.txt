In this example, we have a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing three neurons, and the `ReLU` activation function is used in the hidden layer. The network takes a single input vector and outputs a single scalar value.

The training data consists of five examples, each with three input values and one corresponding output value. For example, the first training example has input values `1`, `1`, and `1`, and the corresponding output value is `1`. The second training example has input values `2`, `2`, and `2`, and the corresponding output value is `2`. Similarly, the third training example has input values `1`, `1`, and `1`, and the corresponding output value is `1`. The fourth training example has input values `3`, `4`, and `6`, and the corresponding output value is `3, 4, 6`. The fifth training example has input values `2`, `3`, `3`, `8`, `1`, and the corresponding output value is `2, 3, 8, 1`.

After the training data, there is a single test example with input values `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `3`, `3`, `8`, `8`, `4`, and the expected output value is `1`.

This format is specific to the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits (0-9) that are fed into a neural network for classification. Each example in the dataset consists of an input vector representing the pixel values of a 28x28 image, and a corresponding output value representing the digit class (0-9).
