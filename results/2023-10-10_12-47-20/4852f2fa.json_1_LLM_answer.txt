This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples for training and testing a simple neural network using the Keras library in Python. The notebook includes code for loading data, preprocessing it, and splitting it into training and test sets. It also includes code for defining and compiling the neural network model, as well as fitting it to the training data. Finally, the notebook includes code for evaluating the performance of the model on the test set.

The first cell in the notebook loads the necessary libraries and imports them into the notebook environment. The second cell loads the iris dataset from scikit-learn's datasets module and splits it into training and test sets. The third cell defines a simple neural network model using Keras, with one hidden layer containing eight neurons and ReLU activation. The fourth cell compiles the model with a loss function and an optimizer. The fifth cell fits the model to the training data using the fit() method. The sixth cell evaluates the model's performance on the test set using the evaluate() method.

The remaining cells provide additional examples of how to use Keras to build and train neural networks. These include examples of how to create more complex models, such as multi-class classification and regression problems, as well as how to use different activation functions and regularization techniques.
