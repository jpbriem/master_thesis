This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of the game Tic-Tac-Toe being played. The first line of each example specifies the current state of the board, and the second line specifies the move made by the player (either 'X' or 'O'). The third line shows the updated state of the board after the move has been made. The fourth line shows the final state of the board, and the fifth line shows the winner of the game (if applicable).

The first example shows a game where player X makes the first move in the center square, followed by player O making their move in the top-left corner. Player X then moves in the top-right corner, and player O responds by moving in the bottom-left corner. Finally, player X moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player X.

The second example shows a game where player O makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player X making their move in the center square. Player O then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player X responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player O moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player O.

The third example shows a game where player X makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player O making their move in the center square. Player X then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player O responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player X moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a draw as both players have two rows of three squares each.

The fourth example shows a game where player O makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player X making their move in the center square. Player O then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player X responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player O moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player O.

The fifth example shows a game where player X makes the first move in the center square, followed by player O making their move in the top-left corner. Player X then moves in the top-right corner, and player O responds by moving in the bottom-left corner. Finally, player X moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player X.

The sixth example shows a game where player O makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player X making their move in the center square. Player O then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player X responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player O moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player O.

The seventh example shows a game where player X makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player O making their move in the center square. Player X then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player O responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player X moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player X.

The eighth example shows a game where player O makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player X making their move in the center square. Player O then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player X responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player O moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player O.

The ninth example shows a game where player X makes the first move in the center square, followed by player O making their move in the top-left corner. Player X then moves in the top-right corner, and player O responds by moving in the bottom-left corner. Finally, player X moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player X.

The tenth example shows a game where player O makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player X making their move in the center square. Player O then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player X responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player O moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player O.

The eleventh example shows a game where player X makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player O making their move in the center square. Player X then moves in the bottom-left corner, and player O responds by moving in the top-right corner. Finally, player X moves in the bottom-right corner, resulting in a win for player X.

The twelfth example shows a game where player O makes the first move in the top-left corner, followed by player X
