I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many local minima. This means that during training, the weights are getting stuck in a suboptimal solution instead of converging to the global minimum. To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. This will prevent the weights from becoming too large and help the network generalize better.
2. Batch normalization: Normalize the inputs to each layer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This will reduce the effect of internal covariate shift and improve the stability of the optimization process.
3. Dropout: Randomly drop out neurons during training to prevent the co-adaptation of neurons. This will force the network to learn multiple representations of the data, leading to better generalization.
4. Increase the number of epochs: Train the network for more epochs to allow it to converge to a better solution.
5. Use a different optimizer: Try using a different optimizer such as Adam, RMSProp, or Adagrad instead of SGD. These optimizers have built-in mechanisms for adjusting the learning rate, which can help escape local minima.
6. Learning rate schedule: Implement a learning rate schedule to gradually decrease the learning rate over time. This will help prevent the network from getting stuck in a local minimum due to a high learning rate.
7. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and adding noise to the input data. This will increase the size of the training set and help the network generalize better.
8. Ensemble methods: Train multiple networks with different initializations and combine their predictions using ensemble methods such as majority voting or averaging. This will improve the overall performance of the model.
9. Reduce the number of hidden layers: Try reducing the number of hidden layers to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.
10. Check the dataset: Make sure that the dataset is properly preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. Also, check for any inconsistencies in the data, such as missing values or outliers.

By applying these techniques, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network and achieve better results on the test set.
