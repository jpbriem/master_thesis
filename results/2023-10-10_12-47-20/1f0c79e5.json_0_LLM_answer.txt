This is an IPython notebook. The first block of code trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset using the `keras` library, with the aim of reproducing the behavior of the perceptron algorithm. The second block of code tests the trained model on a sample from the test set.

The training process involves feeding the model a sequence of input vectors and their corresponding labels, and adjusting the weights of the model to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the true labels. In this case, the inputs are 784-dimensional vectors representing images of handwritten digits, and the labels are integers in the range [0,9] indicating which digit was written.

The architecture of the model is defined using the `Sequential` API of Keras. It consists of three layers: an input layer with 784 neurons, two hidden layers with 512 neurons each, and an output layer with 10 neurons (one for each possible digit). The activation function used in the hidden layers is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), while the output layer uses a softmax activation function to produce probabilities over the 10 classes.

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss. The training loop iterates over the training data in mini-batches of size 128, and updates the weights of the model based on the gradients computed using backpropagation.

Finally, the trained model is tested on a sample from the test set, and its predictions are compared against the true labels.
