I'm trying to use the `fit` method on a neural network to learn from this data and then predict the output for new input data. However, I keep getting an error message that says "shape mismatch: objects cannot be converted to NumPy arrays". I've tried various ways of converting the data into numpy arrays but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me with this?

Here is my code so far:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Load the data
train_input = np.loadtxt('train_input.csv', dtype=np.int8)
train_output = np.loadtxt('train_output.csv', dtype=np.int8)
test_input = np.loadtxt('test_input.csv', dtype=np.int8)

# Convert the data into numpy arrays
X_train = np.array(train_input).reshape(-1, 8)
y_train = np.array(train_output).reshape(-1, 8)
X_test = np.array(test_input).reshape(-1, 8)

# Define the neural network model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(8,), activation='relu')

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the output for the test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
The error message I get is:
```
ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be converted to NumPy arrays
```
I would greatly appreciate any help you can offer in resolving this issue. Thank you!

Answer: The problem is likely due to the fact that the data in your CSV files is not numerical, but rather string values. When you try to convert them to numpy arrays using `np.array`, it fails because numpy cannot convert strings to numbers.

To fix this, you need to modify the way you load the data from the CSV files. Instead of using `np.loadtxt`, which assumes that the data is numerical, you should use the `pd.read_csv` function from the pandas library, which can handle non-numeric data. Here's how you can modify your code:
```
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
train_data = pd.read_csv('train_input.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test_input.csv')

# Convert the data into numpy arrays
X_train = np.array(train_data.values)
y_train = np.array(train_data['output'])
