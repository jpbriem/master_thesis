I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many inputs and outputs, making it difficult for the model to learn and generalize effectively. To address this, you can try the following approaches:

1. Feature selection/engineering: Identify the most relevant features in the dataset and remove the redundant or irrelevant ones. This will reduce the dimensionality of the input data and improve the performance of the model.
2. Data normalization: Normalize the input data to a common range, such as between 0 and 1, to prevent some features from dominating others during training.
3. Model architecture adjustments: Modify the architecture of the model by reducing the number of hidden layers or the number of neurons in each layer. This can help simplify the model and improve its ability to generalize.
4. Regularization techniques: Apply regularization techniques, such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.
5. Ensemble methods: Train multiple models with different architectures and combine their predictions using ensemble methods like bagging or boosting. This can improve the overall performance of the model.
6. Use a different optimizer: Try using a different optimizer, such as Adam or RMSProp, which may converge faster and perform better than the current optimizer.
7. Increase the batch size: Increasing the batch size can help the model converge faster and improve its performance.
8. Early stopping: Implement early stopping to stop training when the validation loss stops improving. This can prevent overfitting and save time during training.
9. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
10. Evaluate the model on a validation set: Split the available data into a training set and a validation set, and evaluate the model's performance on the validation set. This will give you an idea of how well the model is performing and whether further adjustments are needed.
