I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried running the code on different IDEs and computers but still get the same error message. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue you are facing is that the `train` and `test` inputs are not in the correct format for the `neural_network` module to process.

The `neural_network` module expects the input data to be in the following format:

* A list of input layers, where each layer is a numpy array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.
* A list of output layers, where each layer is a numpy array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.

In your case, the `train` and `test` inputs are lists of numpy arrays, where each numpy array represents a single sample. This is not the correct format for the `neural_network` module.

To fix this issue, you need to reshape the `train` and `test` inputs into the correct format. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```python
import numpy as np

# Reshape train input into (n_samples, n_features) format
train = np.array(train).reshape(-1, 3)

# Reshape test input into (n_samples, n_features) format
test = np.array(test).reshape(-1, 3)
```
After reshaping the inputs, you should be able to run the `neural_network` module without any issues.
