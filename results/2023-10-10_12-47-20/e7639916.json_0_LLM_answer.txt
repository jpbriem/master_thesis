I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to overfitting. Your model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data (test set). To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. L1 and L2 regularization are common choices. This will help prevent extreme values for the weights and improve generalization.
2. Dropout: Introduce dropout layers in your model to randomly remove neurons during training. This forces the model to learn multiple representations and prevents any single neuron from dominating the behavior.
3. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the process when the loss stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Batch Normalization: Use batch normalization layers in your model. These layers normalize the inputs to each neuron, which can help reduce overfitting by reducing the effect of outliers in the data.
5. Reduce model size: Try reducing the number of hidden layers or the number of neurons in each layer. A smaller model has fewer parameters to fit the data, which can help prevent overfitting.
6. Increase the amount of data: If possible, collect more data to train your model. A larger dataset provides more examples for the model to learn from, which can help improve its ability to generalize.
7. Ensemble methods: Consider using ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to combine multiple models trained on the same data. This can help improve the overall performance by reducing the impact of overfitting in individual models.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to avoid overfitting. It's important to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their effectiveness for your specific problem.
