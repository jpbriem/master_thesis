End of example.

Note that the last line of each batch is a summary of the outputs for that batch. The numbers in the summary are separated by commas and represent the number of times each element appeared in the output for that batch. For example, the summary for the first batch is "4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4", which means that the element 4 appeared 4 times, the element 2 appeared 2 times, and so on.

Your task is to find a single integer that is common to all the outputs in the test set. In other words, you need to find an integer that appears in every row of the test output.

Hint: The common integer is not necessarily a element in the input. It could be a result of some operation performed on the elements in the input.
