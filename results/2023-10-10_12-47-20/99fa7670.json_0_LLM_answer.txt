This is a simple neural network that takes in 8 binary inputs and outputs a single number. The training data consists of 4 examples, each with 8 input values and their corresponding output values. The test data also consists of 1 example with 8 input values.

To train the model, you can use a library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to create a neural network with one hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer should have 8 neurons (one for each input value) and the output layer should have 1 neuron (for the output value). You can then use the training data to train the model using a supervised learning algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new input data by passing the input values through the network and obtaining the output value from the output layer. In this case, the model should output a single number between 0 and 7, depending on the input values.
