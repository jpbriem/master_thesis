I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer, but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many inputs and outputs, making it difficult for the model to learn the patterns in the data. To address this, you can try the following approaches:

1. Feature selection/engineering: Identify the most relevant features in the dataset and remove the irrelevant ones. This will reduce the dimensionality of the input space and improve the performance of the model.
2. Data normalization: Normalize the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This will help the model converge faster and perform better.
3. Model architecture: Modify the architecture of the model to suit the complexity of the problem. You can try reducing the number of hidden layers or increasing the number of neurons in each layer.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best set of parameters for the model. You can use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to tune the hyperparameters.
5. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
6. Ensemble methods: Use ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to combine multiple models and improve the accuracy.
7. K-fold cross-validation: Split the data into k-folds and evaluate the model on each fold separately. This will give you an idea of the generalization error and help you identify the best model.
8. Early stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the loss stops improving. This will prevent overfitting and save time.
9. Batch normalization: Apply batch normalization to the input data before feeding it to the model. This will help stabilize the training process and improve the performance of the model.
10. Optimize the code: Make sure the code is optimized for performance. You can use techniques like vectorization, parallel processing, or GPU acceleration to speed up the training process.

By applying these techniques, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network and achieve better accuracy on the given dataset.
