I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I've tried changing the architecture of the neural network and adjusting the hyperparameters, but nothing seems to work. Do you have any suggestions?

Answer: The issue with your code is that the `train_input` and `train_output` arrays are not properly formatted for the neural network. Specifically, they are 2D arrays with shape `(10, 10)` instead of 1D arrays with shape `(10)`.

To fix this, you can reshape the arrays as follows:
```python
train_input = np.reshape(train_input, (10, 1))
train_output = np.reshape(train_output, (10, 1))
```
This will convert them from 2D arrays to 1D arrays with the correct shape.

Alternatively, you can also use the `flatten()` method to flatten the 2D arrays into 1D arrays:
```python
train_input = train_input.flat()
train_output = train_output.flat()
```
Once you've made these changes, your code should be able to run without any issues.
