I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the architecture of the model and adjusting hyperparameters but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example per batch, which can cause the model to overfit to the training data. This is because the model is able to perfectly fit the single example in each batch, but it does not generalize well to new examples.

To address this issue, you can try increasing the number of examples per batch. You can do this by either increasing the batch size or by duplicating the existing examples in the training data.

Here are some possible ways to increase the number of examples per batch:

1. Increase the batch size: You can increase the batch size from 32 to a higher value, such as 64 or 128. This will allow the model to see more examples during training, which can help it generalize better.
2. Duplicate examples: You can duplicate each example in the training data multiple times. For example, you can create 5 copies of each example and add them to the training data. This will effectively increase the number of examples per batch without changing the batch size.
3. Use a different data augmentation strategy: If you are using data augmentation, you can try applying different augmentations to each example in the training data. This can effectively increase the number of examples per batch, as each example will have multiple versions.
4. Add noise to the inputs: You can add Gaussian noise or other types of noise to the inputs in the training data. This will introduce random variations to the examples, making them less similar to each other and forcing the model to learn more robust features.

By implementing one or more of these strategies, you should be able to increase the number of examples per batch and improve the generalization performance of your model.
