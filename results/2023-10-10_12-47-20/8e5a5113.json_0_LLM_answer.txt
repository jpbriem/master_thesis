I'm trying to use the `fit` method on a neural network to learn from this data and then predict the output for new inputs. However, I'm having trouble understanding how to format the data correctly for the `fit` method.

Can someone please help me understand what the shape of the data should be when using the `fit` method? Specifically, do the input and output arrays need to have the same shape, or can they have different shapes? Also, what is the purpose of the `epochs` parameter in the `fit` method?

Thank you!
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: A list of integers representing the input data. Each integer represents a feature of the input data. For example, if the input data is a picture, each integer could represent a pixel value. The length of the input array should be equal to the number of features in the input data.
\item Output: A list of integers representing the corresponding output data. Each integer represents a feature of the output data. For example, if the output data is a picture, each integer could represent a pixel value. The length of the output array should be equal to the number of features in the output data.
\item Epochs: An integer representing the number of times the model should iterate over the training data before checking for convergence. A higher number of epochs can lead to overfitting, while a lower number may not allow the model to converge properly.
\end{itemize}
