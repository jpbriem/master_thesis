LLM answer:

?,?,?
?,?,?
?,?,?
\end{code}

The first line contains three numbers separated by spaces, which are the inputs for the first layer of a neural network. The second line contains three numbers separated by spaces, which are the outputs for the first layer. This pattern continues for multiple lines, with each line representing a different example.

In this case, there are three examples in total, and the last line contains the test inputs for which you want to predict the outputs. The question marks represent that the output values are missing and need to be predicted.
