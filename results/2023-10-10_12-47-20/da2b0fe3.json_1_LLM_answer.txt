This is an IPython notebook. The first block of code defines a function `f` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the number of occurrences of each integer in the list. The second block of code loads a dataset from a CSV file and splits it into training and test sets. The third block of code trains a neural network on the training set and uses it to make predictions on the test set. Finally, the fourth block of code displays the accuracy of the model on the test set.

The code for the neural network is not shown, but it is likely to be a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one or more hidden layers and a softmax output layer. The `model.predict()` method is used to make predictions on the test set. The `accuracy_score()` function is used to calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.

It's worth noting that this is just an example, and there are many ways to preprocess data, define neural networks, and evaluate their performance. The specific choices made in this code are likely to depend on the details of the problem being solved and the requirements of the project.
