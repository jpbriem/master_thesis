In this file, we have a training dataset with six examples and a test dataset with one example. Each example in the training dataset consists of three input features (represented as integers) and three corresponding output features (also represented as integers). The goal is to learn a mapping from the input features to the output features.

The first line of each example in the training dataset specifies the input features, separated by commas. The second line specifies the output features, also separated by commas. For example, in the first example, the input features are 0, 0, 0, and the output features are 2, 0, 0.

The last line of each example in the training dataset says "End of example."

The test dataset consists of only one example, which has three input features (0, 1, 0) and three corresponding output features (?,?,?). The question marks indicate that we don't know the correct output values for this example - our task is to predict them based on the training data.

Your job is to write a program that can learn from the training data and make predictions for the test data. You can use any machine learning algorithm you like, or even invent your own!
