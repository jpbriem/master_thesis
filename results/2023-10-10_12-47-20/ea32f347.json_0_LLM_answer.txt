I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single example per batch, which can cause the model to overfit to the training data. To address this, you can try increasing the number of examples per batch by adjusting the `batch_size` parameter in the `TrainingArguments` object.

For example, if you set `batch_size=32`, then each batch will contain 32 examples, which should provide enough data for the model to learn from without overfitting. You may also want to adjust the number of epochs and/or the learning rate to further improve performance.

Additionally, you can also try using techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, or early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of your model.
