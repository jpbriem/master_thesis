This is an IPython notebook. The first block of code imports the necessary libraries and loads the data from a CSV file. The second block of code preprocesses the data by converting it to numerical values and splitting it into training and testing sets. The third block of code trains a neural network on the training data using the Keras library. The fourth block of code tests the trained model on the test data and displays the results.

To use this notebook, open it in a web browser or install the IPython notebook software on your computer. Then, run each cell of code one at a time by clicking the "Run" button or pressing Shift+Enter. You can also modify the code in each cell and run it again to see how the changes affect the results.
