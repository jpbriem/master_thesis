I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried running the code in different IDEs and on different computers but the error persists. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue is that the `train` and `test` inputs are not properly formatted. They are currently just lists of numbers, but they need to be converted into proper dataframes before they can be used as inputs for the machine learning models.

You can convert the lists into dataframes using the `pd.DataFrame()` function from the pandas library. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
import pandas as pd

# Convert train input into a dataframe
train_df = pd.DataFrame(train_input)

# Convert test input into a dataframe
test_df = pd.DataFrame(test_input)
```
Once you have converted the lists into dataframes, you can use them as inputs for your machine learning models.

Additionally, you may want to consider scaling the data before training the model. You can use the `StandardScaler` class from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module to scale the data. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale the train data
scaler = StandardScaler()
train_scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(train_df)

# Scale the test data
test_scaled_data = scaler.transform(test_df)
```
This will scale the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.
