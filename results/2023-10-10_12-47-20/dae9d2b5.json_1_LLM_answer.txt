This is a simple neural network that takes in 6 inputs and outputs 3 outputs. The training data consists of 5 examples, each with 6 input values and 3 corresponding output values. The test data consists of 1 example with 6 input values, and the expected output values are unknown (represented by '?' in the file).

To run this file through the neural network, you would need to provide the training data to the network, adjust the weights and biases of the connections between the artificial neurons, and then provide the test data to see how well the network performed.

It's worth noting that this is a very basic example of a neural network, and in practice, you would typically use much larger datasets and more complex networks to solve real-world problems.
