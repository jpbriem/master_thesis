This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples and tests for a neural network that is designed to recognize handwritten digits. The notebook uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.).

The first section of the notebook provides some background information on the MNIST dataset and explains how to load it into memory using Python. It also defines a function called `load_data` that can be used to load the dataset.

The second section of the notebook presents several examples of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels. These examples are intended to demonstrate the types of inputs that the neural network will be trained on.

The third section of the notebook defines a neural network architecture that can be used to recognize handwritten digits. This architecture consists of a convolutional layer followed by two fully connected layers. The `convolutional` function defines the convolutional layer, while the `fully_connected` function defines the two fully connected layers.

The fourth section of the notebook trains the neural network on the MNIST dataset using the `train` function. This function takes the neural network architecture, the training data, and the number of epochs as input, and returns the trained weights and biases of the network.

The fifth section of the notebook tests the trained neural network on a set of test data using the `test` function. This function takes the trained weights and biases of the network, along with the test data, and outputs the predicted labels for each input in the test data.

Overall, this notebook provides a basic example of how to use Python and Keras to build and train a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
