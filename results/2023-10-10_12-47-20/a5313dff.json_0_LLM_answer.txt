I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to overfitting. Your model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data (test data). To address this, you can try the following techniques:

1. Regularization: Add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. L1 and L2 regularization are common choices. This will help prevent extreme values for the weights and reduce overfitting.
2. Dropout: Introduce dropout layers in your model to randomly set a fraction of the neurons to zero during training. This forces the model to learn multiple representations and reduces overfitting.
3. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Batch Normalization: Use batch normalization layers in your model. Batch normalization helps to reduce overfitting by normalizing the inputs to each layer, which can help the model generalize better.
5. Reduce model complexity: Try reducing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer. A simpler model may generalize better and avoid overfitting.
6. Increase the amount of test data: If possible, try to obtain more test data to evaluate the model's performance on a larger variety of examples.
7. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to the test data, such as flipping, rotating, adding noise, etc. This can provide the model with a larger variety of examples to learn from and improve its ability to generalize.
8. Ensemble methods: Train multiple models with different architectures, hyperparameters, or initializations, and ensemble their predictions. This can help improve the overall performance by reducing overfitting.
9. Evaluate the model on different metrics: Instead of using accuracy, try evaluating the model's performance on other metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, etc. The model may perform better on certain metrics than others, which can give you insight into its strengths and weaknesses.
10. Consider using a different architecture: If none of the above techniques work, consider trying a different neural network architecture, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN), depending on the nature of the data.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to avoid overfitting, and the best approach depends on the specific problem and dataset. You may need to experiment with several techniques to find the optimal combination that works best for your case.
