This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates how to use the Keras functional API to create a simple neural network with two inputs, three outputs, and one hidden layer containing six neurons. The network is trained on a synthetic dataset and then used to make predictions on new data.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import necessary libraries: `import numpy as np` for numerical computing, `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` for visualization, and `from keras.models import Sequential` and `from keras.layers import Dense` for creating the neural network.
2. Define the synthetic dataset: `train_input` and `train_output` contain the input and output data for training the network, respectively. Similarly, `test_input` and `test_output` contain the input and output data for testing the network.
3. Create the neural network architecture: A sequential model is created using `Sequential()`, and three layers are added to it: two dense layers with 64 units each, followed by a final dense layer with 3 units (matching the number of outputs). The activation function for the first two layers is ReLU, while the third layer uses a linear activation function by default.
4. Compile the model: The model is compiled with a loss function (mse for mean squared error), optimizer ('adam' in this case), and metrics (mean squared error and accuracy).
5. Train the model: The model is trained on the training data using `fit()` method.
6. Plot the training and test errors: The training and test errors are plotted against the number of epochs to visualize the training process.
7. Use the model to make predictions: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data using `predict()` method.
8. End of example: This marks the end of the example code.
