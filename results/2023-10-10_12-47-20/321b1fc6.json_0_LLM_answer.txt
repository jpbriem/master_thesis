This is a classic problem known as the "Magic Square" or "Latin Square" problem. It's a well-known problem in computer science and artificial intelligence, and it's often used as a benchmark for testing the performance of machine learning algorithms.

The goal of this problem is to find a magic square, which is a square matrix that satisfies certain properties. In this case, the matrix should have the following properties:

1. Each row and each column should contain exactly 8 ones.
2. Each element in the matrix should be either 0 or 1.
3. There should be no duplicate rows or columns in the matrix.

The problem is to find a magic square of size 3x3, which means that the matrix should have 3 rows and 3 columns. The input data contains several examples of magic squares, and the task is to learn a model that can generate new magic squares that satisfy the above properties.

To solve this problem, you can use any machine learning algorithm that you like, such as neural networks, decision trees, or genetic algorithms. You can also try to solve the problem using logical reasoning or combinatorial methods.

Good luck!
