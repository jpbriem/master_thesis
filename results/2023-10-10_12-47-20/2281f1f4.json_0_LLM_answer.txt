I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. Can you help me?

Answer: The issue is that your model is too complex and has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. As a result, the model is overfitting to the training data and performing poorly on new data.

To address this, you can try the following approaches:

1. Collect more data: Increasing the amount of training data can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.
2. Regularization: You can use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large weights and prevent overfitting.
3. Dropout: Adding dropout layers to the model can help prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the neurons to zero during training.
4. Early stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
5. Reduce model complexity: You can simplify the model architecture by reducing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer.
6. Use a different optimizer: Try using a different optimizer such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad instead of SGD. These optimizers have built-in mechanisms for adjusting learning rates and can help prevent overfitting.
7. Batch normalization: Add batch normalization layers to the model. Batch normalization can help improve the stability and speed up training by reducing the internal covariate shift.
8. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, cropping, and color jittering to the input data. This can help increase the size of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.
9. Ensemble methods: Train multiple models with different architectures and combine their predictions using ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting. This can help improve the overall performance of the model.

By trying out these approaches, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network on new data.
