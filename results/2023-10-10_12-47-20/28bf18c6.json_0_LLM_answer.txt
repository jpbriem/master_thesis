LLM answer:

3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3
\end{code}

The first line of the input is a comment and can be ignored. The next four lines are examples of input/output pairs for the neural network. Each example consists of an input vector (a row of eight binary values) followed by an output vector (a row of eight binary values). The last line of each example is a comment and can be ignored.

The fifth line of the input is a test input vector (a row of eight binary values). The corresponding output vector is expected to be the same as the output vector for the fourth example.

Write a program that reads the input/output pairs from the file and trains a neural network using backpropagation to learn the mapping between the input and output vectors. Use the trained network to compute the output vector for the test input vector.
