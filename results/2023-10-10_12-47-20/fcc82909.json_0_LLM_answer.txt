I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried changing the learning rate and number of epochs but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your training data contains only a single digit per sample, while your model is expecting a sequence of digits as input. When a single digit is fed into the model, it is being padded with zeros to make it a sequence of length 10, which causes the model to output incorrect results.

To fix this, you can modify your training data to contain sequences of length 10, by padding each sample with zeros. For example, if you have a sample `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`, you can pad it to `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` to make it a sequence of length 10.

Alternatively, you can also consider modifying your model architecture to accept a single digit as input, instead of a sequence of length 10. This can be done by removing the `Flatten()` layer and changing the input shape of the first dense layer to `(1,)` instead of `(10,)`.

Additionally, it's worth noting that your model seems to be overfitting to the training data, as evidenced by the high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the test set. To address this, you may want to consider using techniques such as regularization, early stopping, or dropout to prevent overfitting.
