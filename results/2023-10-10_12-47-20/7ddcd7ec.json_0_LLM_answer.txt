I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. Can you help me?

Answer: The issue is that your model is too complex and has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. This results in overfitting, where the model becomes very good at fitting the training data but fails to generalize well to new data.

To address this, you can try the following approaches:

1. Collect more data: Increasing the amount of training data can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.
2. Regularization: You can use techniques like L1/L2 regularization to penalize large weights and prevent overfitting.
3. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
4. Reduce model complexity: Try reducing the number of layers or neurons in each layer to simplify the model and reduce the risk of overfitting.
5. Use a different optimizer: Try using a different optimizer such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad, which may help the model converge faster and avoid getting stuck in local minima.
6. Batch normalization: Apply batch normalization to the inputs to each layer. This can help the model generalize better and improve performance.
7. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and adding noise to the images to increase the size of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.
