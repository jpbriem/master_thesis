I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but that didn't seem to help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your model is too complex and has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. This can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes very good at fitting the training data but does not generalize well to new data.

To address this, there are several things you can try:

1. Reduce the size of the model: You can try reducing the number of hidden layers or the number of neurons in each layer. This will reduce the number of parameters in the model and help prevent overfitting.
2. Regularization: You can add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. This will help prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.
3. Increase the amount of training data: If possible, try to obtain more training data to give the model more information to learn from.
4. Use early stopping: You can use early stopping to stop training the model when its performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This will help prevent overfitting.
5. Try a different optimizer: You can try using a different optimizer such as Adam, RMSprop, or SGD with momentum. These optimizers have built-in mechanisms for adapting the learning rate and can help prevent overfitting.
6. Batch normalization: You can try adding batch normalization to the model. This can help stabilize the training process and improve generalization.
7. Data augmentation: You can try applying data augmentation techniques to the input data to increase the size of the training set. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

It's worth noting that solving an underdetermined system is generally difficult and may require additional information or constraints. If the problem is indeed underdetermined, you may need to consider adding additional constraints or modifying the problem statement to make it better defined.
