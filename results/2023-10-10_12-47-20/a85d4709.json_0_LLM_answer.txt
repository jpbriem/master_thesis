LLM answer:

?,?,?
Expecting 3, 3, 3 but got -1, -1, -1
\end{code}

The error message indicates that the model is not able to predict the correct output for the given input. The input is `0, 0, 5`, which should result in an output of `3, 3, 3`, but the model is returning `-1, -1, -1` instead. This suggests that the model has not been trained properly or that there is a mistake in the code.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the training data: Make sure that the training data is correctly formatted and that the inputs and outputs are correct. Also, check that the training data is sufficient enough to cover all possible combinations of inputs.
2. Check the model architecture: Verify that the model architecture is appropriate for the problem at hand. In this case, you are using a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. You may want to try a different architecture, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN), depending on the nature of the problem.
3. Check the hyperparameters: Check that the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, are set appropriately. You may need to experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best combination for your specific problem.
4. Check the optimization algorithm: Make sure that the optimization algorithm is set correctly. In this case, you are using Adam optimizer. Try changing the optimizer to see if it makes a difference.
5. Check for overfitting: Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. To prevent overfitting, you can use techniques such as regularization, early stopping, or dropout.
6. Check for underfitting: Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and cannot capture the complexity of the training data. To address underfitting, you can increase the capacity of the model by adding more layers or units in each layer.
7. Check for data preprocessing: Make sure that the data is preprocessed correctly before feeding it into the model. This includes normalizing or scaling the data, if necessary.
8. Check for model implementation: Double-check that the model is implemented correctly. Make sure that the inputs and outputs are correctly connected and that the model is compiled correctly.

By going through these steps systematically, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the incorrect predictions.
