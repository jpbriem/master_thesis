Note that the last line of each batch is always 0, 0, 0. This is because in the training data, the last element of each batch is always 0. This is a convention used in the training data to indicate that the last element of each batch should be ignored during training.

The neural network should predict the missing value in the input based on the given inputs and outputs. The predicted output for the test input should be 9, 6, 7.
