This is an IPython notebook that contains a single test case for the game of Hex. The test case consists of four inputs and corresponding expected outputs.

The first line of each input is a list of integers representing the state of the Hex board. Each integer in the list corresponds to a cell on the board and represents the player who has placed a stone on that cell (0 for player 1, 5 for player 2, and 6 for player 3). The remaining lines of each input are blank.

The expected outputs for each input are also lists of integers, representing the final state of the Hex board after all players have placed their stones. The first element of each output list corresponds to the top-left corner of the board and the last element corresponds to the bottom-right corner.

Your task is to write a function that takes a Hex board represented as a list of integers and returns the winner of the game or -1 if there is no winner. You can assume that the input boards will always be valid and that the game will always terminate with a win for one player or a draw.
