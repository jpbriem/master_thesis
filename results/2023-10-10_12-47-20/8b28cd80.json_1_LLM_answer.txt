This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates a simple neural network with two inputs, two hidden units, and one output. The network is trained on a dataset of five examples using the `train` function, and then used to make predictions on a test set using the `test` function.

The `train` function takes in a list of input-output pairs, and uses the `sigmoid` activation function to compute the output for each input. The `test` function does the same thing, but doesn't modify the weights or biases of the network.

The output of the `train` function is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the output of the network for a given input. The output of the `test` function is similar, but it also includes the expected output for each input.

Overall, this code seems to be doing some basic exercises in neural networks, possibly as part of a course or tutorial.
