In this case, we have a sequence of binary vectors as inputs and outputs. The task is to predict the next element in the sequence based on the previous elements.

To solve this problem, you can use a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, such as a simple RNN or a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The RNN will take the previous elements in the sequence as input and produce a prediction for the next element.

Here's an example of how you could implement this using Keras:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(7,)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam())

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
In this example, `X_train` and `X_test` are the training and test input sequences, respectively, and `y_train` and `y_test` are the corresponding output sequences. The model consists of three dense layers with 64 units each, using ReLU activation functions. The final layer has a single unit with a linear activation function by default, which is suitable for regression problems.

The model is compiled with the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer. It's then trained on the training data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. Finally, the model makes predictions on the test set and returns the predicted values.
