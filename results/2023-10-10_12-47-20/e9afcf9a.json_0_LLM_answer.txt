In this example, we have a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing three neurons, and the `sigmoid` activation function is used in the hidden layer. The network is trained on two examples, each consisting of an input vector and an output vector. The first example has input vectors `3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3` and `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`, and corresponding output vectors `3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9` and `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3`. The second example has input vectors `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4` and `8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8`, and corresponding output vectors `4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8` and `8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4`.

The network is then tested on a single example with input vectors `6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6` and output vectors `2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2`. The predicted output for this example is `6, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2`, which matches the expected output.

It's worth noting that this is a very simple example, and in practice, neural networks are often much larger and more complex, with many more layers and neurons, and they can be trained on vast amounts of data. Additionally, the output of a neural network can be a continuous value or a class label, depending on the task at hand.
