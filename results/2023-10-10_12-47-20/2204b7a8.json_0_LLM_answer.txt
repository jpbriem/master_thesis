I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but that didn't seem to work. Any help would be appreciated!

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many inputs and outputs, which makes it difficult for the model to learn the patterns in the data. To fix this, you can try reducing the number of inputs and outputs by combining some of the features.

For example, you can combine the first three features (5, 3, and 0) into a single feature, which would represent the number of balls in the basket. This would reduce the number of inputs to 4, which is a more manageable number for a simple neural network.

Additionally, you can also try reducing the number of outputs by combining some of the output features. For example, you can combine the last two outputs (0 and 4) into a single output, which would represent whether the ball is in the basket or not.

Here's an updated version of your code with these changes:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the number of inputs and outputs
n_inputs = 4
n_outputs = 2

# Define the training data
X_train = np.array([[5, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [5, 0, 3]])
y_train = np.array([[1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1]])

# Define the test data
X_test = np.array([[5, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0], [5, 0, 3]])
y_test = np.array([[1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1]])

# Define the neural network architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_inputs,)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(n_outputs, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model on the test data
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test loss:', loss)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)

# Use the model to make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
With these changes, the neural network should be able to learn the patterns in the data more effectively, and you should see an improvement in the accuracy of the predictions.
