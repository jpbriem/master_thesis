I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried running the code on different IDEs and computers but still get the same error message. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue you are facing is likely due to the fact that your model is not defined in a way that allows it to handle the given input data.

The `train` and `test` inputs are both lists of integers, while the `train_output` and `test_output` are lists of lists of integers. This means that the model expects the input data to be a list of integers, and not a single integer.

To fix this issue, you can modify the model to accept a single integer as input by changing the definition of the model to something like this:
```scss
model {
  input: int
  output: int
}
```
Alternatively, you can also modify the input data to be a list of integers instead of a single integer, like this:
```python
train input:
[0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 8]
[8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0, 5, 8]
...

test input:
[7, 0, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]
[1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7]
[1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 7, 5, 7]
...
```
By making either of these changes, you should be able to run the code without encountering any errors.
