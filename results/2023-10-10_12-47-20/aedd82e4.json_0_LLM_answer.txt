I'm trying to use the `keras.Sequential` model and compile it with a loss function and an optimizer, but I keep getting errors. Here is my code so far:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Load data
X = np.load('X.npy')
y = np.load('y.npy')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# One-hot encode output variables
y_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test)

# Define model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```
The error message I get is:
```
ValueError: Error when checking target: expected dense_3 to have shape (8,) but got array with shape (4,)
```
I don't understand why this is happening since I've already one-hot encoded the output variables and they have shape `(4,)`? Can someone please help me resolve this issue?

Answer: The error message you see suggests that the target shape of your model is not consistent with the shape of the output of the last layer.

You have defined the last layer of your model as `Dense(8, activation='softmax')`, which means that the output of this layer will have shape `(samples, 8)`. However, you have also one-hot encoded the output variables, which means that the target shape of your model should be `(samples, 4)`, where `samples` is the number of samples in your dataset.

To fix this issue, you can change the last layer of your model to `Dense(4, activation='softmax')`, like this:
```
model.add(Dense(4, activation='softmax'))
```
Alternatively, you can remove the one-hot encoding of the output variables and instead use categorical cross-entropy loss function, which can handle categorical targets directly. In this case, you would define the last layer of your model as `Dense(8, activation='softmax')` again, and remove the `to_categorical` call for the target variables.

Here's an updated version of your code that uses the latter approach:
```
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Load data
X = np.load('X.npy')
y = np.load('y.npy')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Define model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='softmax'))

# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), metrics=['ac
