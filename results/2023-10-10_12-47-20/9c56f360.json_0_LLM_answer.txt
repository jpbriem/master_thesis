This is an IPython notebook that demonstrates a simple neural network with two inputs, two hidden units, and one output. The network is trained on a dataset of six examples, where each example consists of a set of input values and the corresponding desired output value. The network is trained using the `backprop` function, which implements the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights and biases of the network based on the error between the predicted output and the desired output. After training, the network is tested on a separate set of input values, and the correctness of the output is checked.

The code first imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, and the Keras library for implementing the neural network.

The next section defines the structure of the neural network, including the number of inputs, hidden units, and outputs. The `input_layer`, `hidden_layer`, and `output_layer` functions are used to define the layers of the network, and the `model` function is used to create the model instance.

The `compile` function is then used to specify the loss function and optimizer for training the network. In this case, the loss function is mean squared error (MSE) and the optimizer is Adam.

The `fit` function is then used to train the network on the training data. The ` epochs` parameter specifies the number of iterations over the training data to perform, and the `verbose` parameter controls the level of output displayed during training.

After training, the `evaluate` function is used to evaluate the performance of the network on the test data. The `loss` and `accuracy` parameters return the MSE loss and accuracy of the network on the test data, respectively.

Finally, the code uses Matplotlib to plot the input and output data for the first example in the test set, highlighting the prediction made by the network.
