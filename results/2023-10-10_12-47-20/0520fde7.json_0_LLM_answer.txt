In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs for the function we want to learn, and at the end, there is a test set that we don't know the output for. The goal is to learn a function from the training data such that it can predict the correct output for the test data.

The format of the input and output is as follows:

* Each line represents one input-output pair.
* The first seven numbers in each line are the inputs, which are binary vectors representing the presence or absence of certain features.
* The last three numbers in each line are the outputs, which are also binary vectors representing the presence or absence of certain labels.

For example, in the first training example, the input is `1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0`, which means that feature 1 is present, feature 2 is absent, feature 3 is absent, feature 4 has value 5, feature 5 is absent, feature 6 is present, and feature 7 is absent. The output for this input is `0, 0, 0`, which means that label 1 is not present, label 2 is not present, and label 3 is not present.

Your task is to write a program that learns a function from the training data and predicts the correct output for the test data. You can use any machine learning algorithm you like, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, etc.

Please submit your solution in the form of a Python script that takes the training data and test data as input and prints the predicted outputs for the test data. Make sure to include appropriate comments and documentation so that your code is easy to understand and modify.
