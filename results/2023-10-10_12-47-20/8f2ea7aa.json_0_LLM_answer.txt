This is a simple neural network that takes an 8-bit binary vector as input and outputs a single number between 0 and 7. The training data consists of eight examples, each with an input vector and a corresponding output value. The test data consists of one example with an input vector and no corresponding output value.

To use this file in Keras, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Keras using `pip install keras`.
2. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
```
3. Load the training and test data from the file:
```python
data = np.loadtxt('neural_network_example.dat', dtype=np.int8)
X_train = data[:8]
y_train = data[8:]
X_test = data[8:]
```
4. Define the model architecture:
```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(8,)))
model.add(Dense(7))
```
The first layer has 8 neurons, uses the ReLU activation function, and takes an 8-bit binary vector as input. The second layer has 7 neurons and outputs a single number between 0 and 7.
5. Compile the model:
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
The optimizer used is Adam, the loss function is categorical cross-entropy, and the metric tracked is accuracy.
6. Train the model:
```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128)
```
Train the model on the training data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128.
7. Evaluate the model:
```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test loss: {loss:.3f}, Test accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}')
```
Evaluate the model on the test data and print the test loss and accuracy.

Note: This is just a simple example to illustrate how to create a neural network in Keras using Python. In practice, you may need to preprocess the data, normalize it, or use different architectures and hyperparameters depending on the problem you are trying to solve.
