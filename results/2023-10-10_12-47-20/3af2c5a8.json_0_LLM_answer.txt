The task is to predict the missing values in the test input based on the given training data. The output format for the test data is the same as the input format, with each row representing a single example and each column representing a single feature. The missing values in the test input are represented by question marks (`?`). Your job is to fill in these question marks with the appropriate values based on the patterns and relationships observed in the training data.

Note that there may be multiple possible ways to fill in the missing values, and your solution should explain your reasoning and provide evidence from the training data to support your choices.
