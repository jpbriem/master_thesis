The task is to determine the value of the last three question marks (`?,?,?`) in the test output. To do this, you need to figure out what rule the neural network has learned from the training data. The first six examples in the training data are provided to help you understand the relationship between the input and output.

Note that the last three examples in the training data are identical to the first three examples, but with an additional `8` at the end of each line. This is because the neural network was trained on a dataset that contained these examples, and it has learned to recognize the pattern in them. Your goal is to recognize the same pattern in the test input and provide the corresponding output.

Hint: Try to find a simple rule that explains how the neural network is transforming the input into the output. You can use the information about the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions to help you understand the inner workings of the neural network. Good luck!
