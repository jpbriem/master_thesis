This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples and a test case for a neural network that is designed to recognize handwritten digits. The notebook includes the input data and expected output for each example and the test case.

The first section of the notebook provides some background information on the problem of recognizing handwritten digits and how it can be approached using machine learning techniques. The second section describes the architecture of the neural network that will be used to solve this problem.

The third section presents several examples of handwritten digit recognition tasks, with input data and expected output for each example. These examples are intended to demonstrate the capabilities of the neural network and its ability to generalize to new situations.

The fourth section presents a test case that consists of four images of handwritten digits, along with the corresponding expected output. This test case is intended to evaluate the performance of the neural network on a set of inputs that it has not seen before.

Overall, this notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to the problem of handwritten digit recognition and demonstrates the effectiveness of using neural networks to solve this problem. It also serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in exploring the use of machine learning techniques for image classification tasks.
