This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of MNIST data, which is a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The notebook includes both training and test data, with the goal being to use the training data to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the labels for the test data.

The training data consists of 784 images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels. Each row of the matrix corresponds to a single pixel in the image, and the values are either 0 or 1, indicating whether the pixel is black or white, respectively. The accompanying label for each image indicates which digit was written.

The notebook also includes a few examples of MNIST data in various formats, such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. These examples demonstrate how the data can be represented in different ways, but the underlying structure remains the same.

Overall, this notebook provides a simple introduction to the MNIST dataset and its usage in machine learning applications.
