In this file, we have a few examples of input-output pairs for training the network, and a single test case at the end. The inputs are 3-dimensional vectors, and the outputs are also 3-dimensional vectors.

The first line of each example specifies the input vector, and the second line specifies the corresponding output vector. For example, in the first example, the input is `[1, 1, 1]` and the output is `[0, 0, 0]`. The last line of each example contains a comment indicating the end of that example.

The test case at the end has inputs `[2, 0, 0]` and `[2, 0, 0]`, but the outputs are left blank (``?`) since they are not provided. This indicates that the network should predict the missing outputs given the inputs.
