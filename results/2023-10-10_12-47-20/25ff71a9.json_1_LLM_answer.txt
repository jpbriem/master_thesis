As you can see, the training data consists of four examples, each with three input values and three corresponding output values. The first two inputs are always zero, and the third input is either zero or one. The output values are always zero for the first two examples, and they match the third input value for the last two examples.

The test data also consists of four examples, with the same format as the training data.

This dataset is a classic example of a perceptron learning problem, where the goal is to learn a linear boundary that separates the different classes. In this case, the classes are defined by the parity of the third input value (zero or one). The perceptron algorithm will learn a weight vector that separates the classes correctly, but it will take some iterations to converge.
