This is an IPython notebook. The first block of code defines a function `nn_layer` that takes in a numpy array and applies a simple neural network layer to it. The second block of code loads the training data from a file called `data.csv`. The third block of code splits the training data into training and validation sets. The fourth block of code defines a loss function and an optimizer for training the model. The fifth block of code trains the model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the validation set. The sixth block of code uses the trained model to make predictions on a test set. Finally, the seventh block of code prints out various statistics about the model's performance.

The training data is in the form of input-output pairs, where each input is a 10-dimensional vector and each output is a 10-dimensional vector. The inputs and outputs are separated by a newline character. The training data is split into training and validation sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. The loss function used is mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted output and the true output. The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001.

The model consists of three fully connected layers with 256 neurons each. The activation functions used are ReLU for the hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer. Batch normalization is also applied to each layer. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

After training, the model is used to make predictions on a test set. The test set consists of input vectors only, and the corresponding output vectors are computed using the trained model. Finally, various statistics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared value are computed to evaluate the model's performance.
