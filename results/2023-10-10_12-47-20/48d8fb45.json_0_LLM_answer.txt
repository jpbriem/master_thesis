This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the game Tic-Tac-Toe being played out in a text format. The first line of each example is the current state of the board, represented as a list of 9 integers representing the cells of the board (0 for empty, 1 for X, and 2 for O). The second line is the move made by the player whose turn it is (X or O), represented as a list of 3 integers giving the row, column, and value to be placed in that cell (e.g., [1, 2, 1] means place an X in the top right corner). The third line is the new state of the board after the move has been made. The fourth line is the final state of the board (after all moves have been made), and the fifth line is the winner of the game (if applicable; if no one wins, this line will say "None").

The last section of the code represents a test case for the AI agent. It starts with the initial state of the board, followed by three question marks (representing the three possible moves the agent can make). Your task is to fill in these question marks with the appropriate moves for the agent to make in order to win the game.
