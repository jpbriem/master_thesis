This is an IPython notebook that contains a series of examples and a test case for a neural network that is designed to recognize handwritten digits. The notebook provides the input data and expected output for each example and test case, but it does not include the code for the neural network or any explanations of how the network was trained.

The first section of the notebook contains five examples, each of which consists of a set of input values and the corresponding expected output. The inputs are represented as lists of integers, and the outputs are represented as lists of integers as well. For example, the first input in the first example is `[4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and the expected output is `[8, 8, 8, 8]`.

The second section of the notebook contains a single test case, which consists of a set of input values and a set of expected output values. Like the examples, the inputs and outputs are represented as lists of integers.

Overall, this notebook appears to be a collection of sample data that could be used to train and test a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits.
