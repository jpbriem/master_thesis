This is an IPython notebook. The first block of code defines a function `f` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the elements in the list. The second block of code defines a neural network with one hidden layer containing 16 neurons, and trains it on a dataset consisting of nine input-output pairs. The third block of code tests the trained network on a new set of inputs and prints the predicted outputs.

The training data consists of nine examples, each with ten input values and three output values. For example, the first input vector is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and the corresponding output vector is `[6, 6, 7]`. The second input vector is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]`, and the corresponding output vector is `[0, 5, 7]`. The remaining seven examples follow a similar pattern.

The neural network is defined using the Keras library's `Sequential` model class. It has one hidden layer with 16 neurons, and uses the ReLU activation function for both the hidden and output layers. The loss function used during training is mean squared error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the predicted output and the true output. The optimizer used is Adam, which is a popular stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

During training, the input data is preprocessed by normalizing the input values to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. This helps improve the stability and speed of training.

After training, the network is tested on a new set of inputs, and the predicted outputs are printed. However, instead of providing the actual output values, the notebook simply prints `?,?,?` for each example, indicating that the output values are unknown.
