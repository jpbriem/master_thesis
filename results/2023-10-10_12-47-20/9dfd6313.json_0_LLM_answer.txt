This is an IPython notebook that contains a few examples of the MNIST dataset, which is a popular image classification benchmark. The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels (the digit itself).

The notebook first loads the MNIST dataset using the `numpy` library and then displays some examples of the data using Matplotlib. It also shows how to use the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

In this case, the dataset has been split into four parts: training set, testing set, validation set, and extra set. The training set and testing set are used for training and evaluating the model, respectively. The validation set is used for early stopping, and the extra set is left unused.

The notebook then demonstrates how to create a simple neural network using Keras, a deep learning library, and compile it with a loss function and an optimizer. Finally, it trains the model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the testing set.
