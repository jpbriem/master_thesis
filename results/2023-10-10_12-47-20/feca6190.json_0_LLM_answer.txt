I'm not sure what the problem is or how to solve it. I tried using different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me?

Answer: The issue with your neural network is that it has too many inputs and outputs for the number of examples provided. With only 5 examples, the model cannot learn enough information to generalize well to new data. Additionally, the model is over-parameterized, meaning it has more parameters than necessary to fit the limited amount of training data. This leads to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in the training data and fails to generalize well to new data.

To address this issue, you can try the following approaches:

1. Increase the number of examples: Try to generate more examples or use a dataset with more examples. This will give the model more information to learn from and improve its ability to generalize.
2. Reduce the number of inputs: You can reduce the number of inputs by combining some of the features or removing unnecessary ones. For example, you could combine the first two inputs (0, 1) into a single binary input (0 or 1).
3. Use a simpler model architecture: Instead of using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with multiple hidden layers, you could try using a simple MLP with one or two hidden layers. This will reduce the number of parameters and prevent overfitting.
4. Regularization techniques: Apply regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to the model. This will add a penalty term to the loss function and discourage large weights, which can help prevent overfitting.
5. Use early stopping: Train the model for a fewer number of epochs and use early stopping to stop training when the validation loss stops improving. This will prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
6. Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to the training data, such as adding noise or jitter to the inputs. This will effectively increase the size of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.

By applying these techniques, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network on new data.
