I'm trying to use the `fit()` method on a neural network to learn from this data and make predictions on new examples. However, I keep getting an error message that says "shape too large". Here is my code so far:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Load the data
X = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',')
y = np.loadtxt('labels.csv', delimiter=',')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create a neural network classifier with one hidden layer
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10,), activation='relu', solver='adam', alpha=0.01)

# Fit the model to the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print the accuracy score
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```
Can someone please help me figure out what is causing this error and how to fix it? Thank you!

Answer: The error message "shape too large" suggests that the size of the input data is too big for the neural network to handle. This can happen when the number of input features is very large or when the number of samples is very small.

In your case, the input data has 5 features (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) and the number of samples is 4 (3 training examples + 1 test example). This means that the input data matrix has a shape of (4, 5), which is too small for the neural network to learn meaningful patterns from.

To resolve this issue, you can try increasing the number of samples in your dataset. You can either generate more synthetic data using the same distribution as your existing data or collect more real-world data that matches your problem domain.

Alternatively, you can try reducing the number of input features by selecting only the most relevant features for your problem. For example, if you notice that certain features are always zero or have a negligible impact on the output, you can drop those features from your input data.

Once you have increased the number of samples or reduced the number of input features, you should be able to train your neural network without encountering the "shape too large" error.
