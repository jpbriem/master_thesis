I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it. I tried running the code with different examples and it seems to work fine for some of them but not others. Can someone please help me figure out what's going on?

Answer: The issue is that your model is too complex and has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. This results in overfitting, where the model becomes very good at fitting the training data but fails to generalize well to new, unseen data.

To address this, you can try the following approaches:

1. Collect more data: Increasing the amount of training data can help the model generalize better to new examples.
2. Regularization: You can add a regularization term to the loss function to penalize large weights. L1 and L2 regularization are common techniques used to reduce the magnitude of model weights and prevent overfitting.
3. Dropout: This technique randomly sets a fraction of the neurons to zero during training, effectively creating an ensemble of different sub-networks. This helps to prevent any single neuron from dominating the network's behavior.
4. Early Stopping: Monitor the validation loss during training and stop the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents overfitting by stopping the training before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
5. Reduce model complexity: You can simplify the model architecture by reducing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer.
6. Batch normalization: Normalizing the inputs to each layer can help the model generalize better to new data.
7. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models can help improve generalization. You can use techniques like bagging or boosting to combine multiple models trained on the same data.

It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to avoid overfitting, and the best approach will depend on the specific problem you're trying to solve. A combination of these techniques may be necessary to achieve the best results.
