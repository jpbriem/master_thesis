LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
c, h, i, i, i
f, f, g, f, e
i, f, f, f, c
i, i, e, d, g

c, h, f, f, f
i, i, g, i, e
f, i, i, i, c
f, f, e, d, g
g, i, b, j, d
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for solving these types of puzzles involves manipulating the letters in each row to create a new row with the same number of letters as the original row. Here's how you can apply this pattern to solve the test input:

Test input: `i, i, e, f`

1. Row 1: `i, i` becomes `ii`
2. Row 2: `e, f` becomes `ef`
3. Row 3: `d, h, b, j` becomes `dhbj`
4. Row 4: `g, e, i, i` becomes `giei`

So, the test output is `giei`.

Now, let me explain the general strategy for solving these types of puzzles:

1. Start by reading the input rows one at a time, starting from the top left corner.
2. For each row, manipulate the letters using the following rules:
	* If there are fewer than 5 letters in the row, add a space character (``) to make up the difference.
	* If there are exactly 5 letters in the row, do not change anything.
	* If there are more than 5 letters in the row, remove the excess letters (starting from the right) until you have exactly 5 letters remaining.
3. After applying the above rules to each row, combine the resulting rows into a single string of letters.

By following this strategy, you should be able to solve any of these types of puzzles. Good luck!
