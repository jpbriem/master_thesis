[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for each set of inputs is to alternate between "a" and "d" characters in the output. Here's how it works:

1. For each input row, read the first character (always an "a").
2. If the next character is also "a", repeat the previous character (i.e., "a") as the output. Otherwise, change to "d".
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each remaining character in the input row.
4. Move on to the next input row and repeat the process.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the test input:

Test input: a, e, e, d, a, a

Step 1: Read the first character of the input (a).
Step 2: Since the next character is also "a", repeat the previous character ("a") as the output. So, the output for the first input row is "a".
Step 3: Now move on to the second input row. Read the first character (e). Since the next character is not "a", change to "d" and output "d".
Step 4: Continue this alternating pattern for each remaining input row, resulting in the following output:

g, g, d, d, g

Therefore, the test output for the given test input is "g, g, d, d, g".
