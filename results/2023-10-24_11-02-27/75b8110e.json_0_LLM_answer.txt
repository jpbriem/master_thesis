LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been given a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns observed in the examples provided, I will try to solve the test input by applying the same steps. Here's how I will approach it:

1. Identify the common elements between the input and output rows. In this case, we can see that each row has either "e", "a", or "f" in common.
2. Look for repeating patterns in the input rows. In the first two examples, we can see that every other row has the letter "a" repeated twice. In the third example, every second row has the letter "g" repeated twice.
3. Use these patterns to fill in the missing letters in the test input. Starting from the leftmost column, we can see that there is an "a" in the first position, followed by an "e". Using the repeating pattern observed in the previous examples, we can fill in the remaining letters as follows:
	* Second column: "a" (repeating pattern)
	* Third column: "e" (observed in the first example)
	* Fourth column: "a" (repeating pattern)
	* Fifth column: "f" (observed in the second example)
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the entire test input has been filled in. Here's the complete solution:

Test input: a, e, a, e, f, a, a, a

Solution:

a, e, a, e, f, a, a, a
a, e, e, a, a, f, a, a
e, e, e, a, a, f, a, a
a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a
g, a, g, g, j, j, j, a
a, a, a, g, a, j, a, a
a, g, a, a, a, a, j, j
g, a, a, a, a, j, a, a

The completed test input has the correct letters according to the patterns observed in the training examples.
