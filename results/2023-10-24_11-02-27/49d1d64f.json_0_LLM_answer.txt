LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one letter to the right each time, while also rotating the entire grid by 90 degrees clockwise. Here's how it works:

1. If the input has an odd number of letters (like `b, c`), the output will have an odd number of letters as well. In these cases, we need to shift the input by one letter to the right to get the next output. For example, `b, c` becomes `a, b, c`.
2. If the input has an even number of letters (like `d, i`), the output will always have an even number of letters. In these cases, we don't need to do anything - the output will be the same length as the input. For example, `d, i` remains `d, i`.
3. When shifting the input by one letter to the right, we also need to rotate the entire grid by 90 degrees clockwise. This ensures that the resulting output is correctly aligned.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the final test input `c, i`:

Input: `c, i`
Shift by 1 letter to the right: `a, c`
Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise: `a, c`

So the test output for `c, i` is `a, c`.

Solution:
a, c, i, a
c, c, i, i
b, b, e, e
d, d, e, e
a, d, e, a
