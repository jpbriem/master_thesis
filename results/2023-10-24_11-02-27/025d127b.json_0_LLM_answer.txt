LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, it seems like the puzzle involves identifying a simple substitution pattern to transform each row of letters into its corresponding output row. Here's how you can solve this puzzle:

1. Observe that each output row has exactly one "e" symbol, which represents an "exchange" operation between two adjacent symbols. For example, in the first output row, there is an "e" symbol between the second and third "a" symbols, indicating that these two symbols should be exchanged.
2. Notice that each input row contains only one "i" symbol, which represents an "invert" operation for the entire row. Whenever an "i" symbol appears in an input row, you should invert the entire row (i.e., change all symbols to their opposite).
3. Now, let's analyze the pattern in more detail. Each output row consists of three or four "a" symbols followed by zero or one "e" symbol. Moreover, each input row consists of three or four "a" symbols followed by zero or one "i" symbol. This suggests that we can use a simple substitution pattern to transform each input row into its corresponding output row. Specifically, we can substitute each "a" symbol in the input row with the next symbol in the output row modulo 4 (i.e., wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary).
4. Finally, apply the above substitution pattern to the test input to obtain the test output.

Here's how the solution would look like for the test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Substitution pattern:
a -> b (mod 4)
b -> c (mod 4)
c -> d (mod 4)
d -> e (mod 4)

Transformed input: b, c, d, d, d, d, d, d, d

Applying the substitution pattern to the transformed input gives us the test output:

Test output: b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b

Note that this solution relies on the fact that the input and output rows have the same length (i.e., 4 symbols each). If the lengths are different, additional modifications may be required to ensure that the substitution pattern works correctly.
