LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
g, f, f
f, b, h
e, f, c
train output:
g, g, f, f, f
g, g, f, f, f
f, f, b, h, h
e, e, f, c, c
e, e, f, c, c
End of example.
train input:
b, d, f
b, c, i
i, d, i
train output:
b, b, d, f, f
b, b, d, f, f
b, b, c, i, i
i, i, d, i, i
i, i, d, i, i
End of example.
train input:
c, d, h
c, b, g
b, f, h
train output:
c, c, d, h, h
c, c, d, h, h
c, c, b, g, g
b, b, f, h, h
b, b, f, h, h
End of example.
test input:
b, c, f
h, d, g
h, g, f

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the examples provided, it seems like you have a simple substitution cipher puzzle. In this type of puzzle, each letter in the input is replaced by a different letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

From the examples you've provided, I can see that the pattern is:

* Each letter in the input is shifted 1 position down the alphabet (so "a" becomes "b", "b" becomes "c", etc.)
* If the input contains more than one letter, they are all shifted together (so "abcd" becomes "efgh")

Using this pattern, we can decode the test input "b, c, f" as follows:

* "b" becomes "e" (since "b" is 1 position down the alphabet)
* "c" becomes "g" (since "c" is 2 positions down the alphabet)
* "f" remains unchanged (since it is not shifted)

So the decoded test input is "e, g, f".

Can you please provide me with another test input to decode?

Solution:
b, b, c, f, f
b, b, c, f, f
h, h, d, g, g
h, h, g, f, f
h, h, g, f, f
