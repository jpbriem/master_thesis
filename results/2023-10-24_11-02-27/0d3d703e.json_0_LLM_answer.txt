LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be shifting the letters one position to the right in each row. So, if the input is `d, b, c`, the output would be `e, f, g`. If we apply this pattern to the test input `i, b, d`, the output should be `i, f, g`.
2. Second example:
In this case, the pattern seems to be rotating the letters by 90 degrees clockwise. So, if the input is `c, d, i`, the output would be `g, e, j`. If we apply this pattern to the test input `i, b, d`, the output should be `j, e, c`.
3. Third example:
Here, the pattern involves swapping two adjacent letters. So, if the input is `f, i, g`, the output would be `b, j, c`. If we apply this pattern to the test input `i, b, d`, the output should be `j, e, c`.
4. Fourth example:
This time, the pattern involves moving the letters down by one position. So, if the input is `j, e, c`, the output would be `i, d, g`. If we apply this pattern to the test input `i, b, d`, the output should be `i, d, g`.

Based on these observations, the overall pattern in the examples seems to be some combination of shifting, rotation, and letter swapping. We can try applying these operations to the test input `i, b, d` to see what the output might be:

* Shift right: `i, b, d` becomes `i, b, e`
* Rotate 90 degrees clockwise: `i, b, e` becomes `j, b, e`
* Swap adjacent letters: `j, b, e` becomes `j, d, e`

Therefore, the test output for the given input `i, b, d` is `j, d, e`.
