LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You're given a set of examples where each input is followed by one or more corresponding output(s). Your task is to identify the pattern that generates these outputs from their inputs.

From the examples you provided, I can see that the pattern involves shifting the input letters horizontally by one position, and then repeating the process until no shift is needed anymore. Here's how it works:

1. If the input has only one letter, the output will be the same letter repeated twice. (Example: `j` becomes `jj`.)
2. If the input has two letters next to each other, they will become the first and last letters of the output. (Examples: `jh` becomes `jjh`, `ij` becomes `iji`).
3. If the input has three or more letters, they will become the middle letters of the output, shifted by one position horizontally. (Examples: `jhj` becomes `jhhj`, `ijhi` becomes `ijhii`.)

Using this pattern, we can generate the following output for the test input `j, h, j`:
```
jjhhj
```
And here's how we got it:

* `j` becomes `jj` (since it has only one letter)
* `h` becomes `hj` (since it has two letters next to each other)
* `j` becomes `jj` again (since it has only one letter)

So the output for the test input `j, h, j` is `jjhhj`.
