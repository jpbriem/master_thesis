LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been provided with a set of input and output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you've observed in the examples, your goal is to determine the step-by-step process that transforms an input into its corresponding output.

Here's how you can approach this problem:

1. Identify common elements between inputs and outputs: In each pair of input and output, look for any repeating patterns or common elements. For instance, in the first two examples, both inputs and outputs contain the letter "a" repeatedly.
2. Analyze the position of these common elements: Once you've identified common elements, analyze their positions within the input and output sequences. Are they always at the same position? Do they follow a specific pattern?
3. Determine the transformation rule: Based on your analysis, try to devise a general transformation rule that can be applied to any input to produce its corresponding output. For example, if the common element appears at the second position in both inputs and outputs, you could use a simple substitution rule like "replace every 'a' with 'c'".
4. Test your rule: Apply your transformation rule to new inputs and verify whether the output matches the expected result. If your rule works correctly, you can refine it by adjusting parameters or adding additional rules to handle more complex cases.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you reach the desired level of accuracy: Continue analyzing inputs and outputs, identifying common elements, and devising transformation rules until you achieve the desired level of accuracy.

By following these steps, you should be able to develop a reliable algorithm for solving this type of puzzles. Good luck!
