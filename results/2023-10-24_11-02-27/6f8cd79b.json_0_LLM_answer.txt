LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down each example you provided:

Example 1:
Input: a, a, a
Output: i, i, i

Pattern: Each letter appears twice before moving to the next letter.

Explanation:

1. First letter 'a' appears once on the top row, then moves to the middle row and appears again.
2. Second letter 'a' appears once on the middle row, then moves to the bottom row and appears again.
3. Third letter 'a' appears once on the bottom row, then moves to the top row and appears again.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each letter.

Example 2:
Input: a, a, a
Output: i, i, i

Pattern: Each letter appears three times before moving to the next letter.

Explanation:

1. First letter 'a' appears once on the top row, then moves to the middle row and appears again.
2. Second letter 'a' appears once on the middle row, then moves to the bottom row and appears again.
3. Third letter 'a' appears once on the bottom row, then moves to the top row and appears again.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each letter.

Example 3:
Input: a, a, a, a, a, a
Output: i, i, i, i, i, i

Pattern: Each letter appears four times before moving to the next letter.

Explanation:

1. First letter 'a' appears once on the top row, then moves to the middle row and appears again.
2. Second letter 'a' appears once on the middle row, then moves to the bottom row and appears again.
3. Third letter 'a' appears once on the bottom row, then moves to the top row and appears again.
4. Fourth letter 'a' appears once on the top row, then moves to the middle row and appears again.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each letter.

Based on these patterns, we can now apply them to the test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a, a

Step 1:
Top row: a, a
Middle row: a, a
Bottom row: a, a

Step 2:
Top row: a, a
Middle row: a, a
Bottom row: a, a

Step 3:
Top row: a, a
Middle row: a, a
Bottom row: a, a

Step 4:
Top row: a, a
Middle row: a, a
Bottom row: a, a

Step 5:
Top row: a, a
Middle row: a, a
Bottom row: a, a

The output for the test input is:

[i, i, i, i, i, i]

Solution:
i, i, i, i, i, i
i, a, a, a, a, i
i, a, a, a, a, i
i, a, a, a, a, i
i, a, a, a, a, i
i, a, a, a, a, i
i, i, i, i, i, i
