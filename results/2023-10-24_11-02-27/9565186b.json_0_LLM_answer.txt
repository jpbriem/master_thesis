LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply replacing each 'c' with the next letter in the alphabet (ignoring any duplicates). So, if we start with 'c', it becomes 'd'; if we start with 'd', it becomes 'e'; and so on. Therefore, the output for the test input 'b, d, c' would be 'b, e, e'.
2. Second example:
This one is a bit more complex. We have three sequences of letters: 'b, b, b', 'i, b, d', and 'i, c, c'. Each sequence has a unique ending letter, which is repeated twice. Therefore, the output for the test input 'b, d, c' would be 'b, d, d'.
3. Third example:
Again, this one is similar to the first two examples. The pattern seems to be replacing each 'c' with the next letter in the alphabet (ignoring duplicates). So, the output for the test input 'b, d, c' would be 'b, e, e'.
4. Fourth example:
This is the most complex pattern yet. We have four sequences of letters: 'd, d, i', 'e, e, e', 'i, b, b', and 'c, c, c'. Each sequence has a unique starting letter and repeats the same letter twice. Therefore, the output for the test input 'b, d, c' would be 'd, d, d'.

So, based on these observations, the general pattern that emerges is:

Input: Sequence of letters
Output: Repeat the last letter of the input sequence twice

Applying this pattern to the test input 'b, d, c', we get the output 'b, d, d'.
