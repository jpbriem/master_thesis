LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
j, a, a
j, j, j
j, j, j
train output:
a, j, j
a, j, j
j, j, j
End of example.
train input:
g, g, g
a, a, a
g, g, a
train output:
g, a, a
g, a, g
g, a, g
End of example.
train input:
a, a, j
a, a, j
j, j, j
train output:
j, j, j
a, a, j
a, a, j
End of example.
train input:
c, a, c
a, a, c
a, c, c
train output:
c, c, c
a, a, c
c, a, a
End of example.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one position to the right, and then applying a rotation of 90 degrees clockwise. Here's how it works:

1. If the input has an 'a', shift the input to the right by one position and rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.
2. If the input does not have an 'a', keep the input unchanged.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you reach the end of the input.
4. The resulting output will be the same length as the input, with each letter shifted over by one position to the right and rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

Using this pattern, let's apply it to the test input:

Test Input: a, a, a
f, a, a
a, f, f

We start by shifting the first row to the right by one position:

Shifted Input: a, a, a
f, a, a
a, f, f

Next, we rotate the second row by 90 degrees clockwise:

Rotated Input: a, a, a
a, f, f
a, f, f

Finally, we repeat these steps for the third row:

Shifted Input: a, a, a
a, f, f
a, f, f

And the resulting output is:

Output: f, f, f

Great job! You have successfully solved the puzzle using the pattern of shifting and rotating the input.
