LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down each example and identify the pattern behind the transformations.

Example 1:

* Input: i, f, a
* Output: i, f, a, a, i, i

The pattern here is that for every "i" in the input, there should be an "a" in the output, and vice versa. Additionally, whenever there is an "f" in the input, it becomes an "a" in the output.

Example 2:

* Input: d, i, c
* Output: d, i, c, i, d, d

The pattern here is that for every "d" in the input, there should be an "i" followed by a "c". Whenever there is an "i" in the input, it becomes an "d" in the output.

Example 3:

* Input: a, d, a
* Output: a, d, a, a, g, a

The pattern here is that for every "a" in the input, there should be a "d" followed by another "a". Whenever there is a "g" in the input, it becomes an "a" in the output.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

* Test input: c, f, a
* Test output: a, f, a, a, c, c

Explanation:

* For every "c" in the test input, there should be an "a" in the output (pattern from Example 1).
* For every "f" in the test input, there should be an "a" in the output (pattern from Example 1).
* For every "a" in the test input, there should be another "a" in the output (pattern from Example 2).

Therefore, the test output is a, f, a, a, c, c.

Solution:
c, f, a, d, c, c
c, f, b, b, f, f
d, b, b, b, b, a
a, b, b, b, b, d
f, f, b, b, f, c
c, c, d, a, f, c
