[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
j, b, e
j, b, e
c, b, b
train output:
j, b, e
j, b, e
c, b, b
c, b, b

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one letter to the right each time, while also changing the top row of the input by replacing the first letter with the second letter of the previous row. Here's how the pattern works:

1. If the top row of the input contains only one letter, keep it unchanged and shift the rest of the input by one letter to the right.
2. If the top row of the input contains two letters, replace the first letter with the second letter of the previous row, and shift the rest of the input by one letter to the right.

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input: `c, j, c`

Step 1: Shift the input by one letter to the right, keeping the top row unchanged.

Input: `c, j, c`

Step 2: Replace the first letter of the top row with the second letter of the previous row (since there are only two letters in the top row).

Top row: `c -> b`

Input: `b, j, c`

Step 3: Shift the rest of the input by one letter to the right.

Input: `b, j, c`

Output: `b, j, b`

Therefore, the test output is `b, j, b`.
