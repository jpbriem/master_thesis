LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You've been given a set of input-output pairs for a puzzle. Based on the patterns you've observed in the examples, your goal is to find a general rule that can be applied to any input to produce the corresponding output. Here's how you can approach this problem:

1. Identify common patterns: Look for patterns in the input-output pairs you've been provided. For instance, in the first example, the input "c, a, a, a, a, c, a, a" is followed by the output "c". In the second example, the input "i, a, i, a, a, a, a, i" leads to the output "i". These patterns could be simple substitutions or more complex rules.
2. Create a hypothesis: Based on the patterns you've identified, create a hypothesis that speculates the general rule governing the puzzle. For example, your hypothesis might be something like: "For each input, replace every 'a' with 'b', and every 'c' with 'i'."
3. Test your hypothesis: Apply your hypothesis to the test input you were provided. If your hypothesis is correct, then the output should match the expected output. If it doesn't, refine your hypothesis and repeat the process until you arrive at a valid solution.
4. Refine your hypothesis: Once you have a working hypothesis, try to simplify it further by removing unnecessary steps or variables. This will make the rule easier to apply to new inputs.
5. Generalize your solution: Now that you have a solution for the specific puzzle you were given, try to extend it to more complex inputs. Think about how your solution can be modified to handle different types of inputs or variations of the puzzle.

By following these steps, you should be able to develop a general rule that can be applied to any input to produce the corresponding output. Good luck!
