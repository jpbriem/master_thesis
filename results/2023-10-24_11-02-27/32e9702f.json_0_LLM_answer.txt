LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle together. Based on the provided examples, it seems like the pattern involves replacing each letter in the input with the letter that appears three positions ahead of it in the alphabet.

Here's how we can apply this pattern to the test input:

Test Input: `a, a, g, g, g, g, a, a, a`

1. Start with the first letter `a`. Since it appears in the third position ahead of itself in the alphabet, the replacement value is `g`. So, the first letter becomes `g`.
2. Now, consider the second letter `a`. It appears in the fourth position ahead of itself in the alphabet, so the replacement value is `g`. Therefore, the second letter becomes `g`.
3. Continue this process for each letter in the input until you reach the end.

Applying this pattern to the entire test input gives us the following output:

`g, g, g, g, g, g, a, a, a`

Great! We have successfully solved the puzzle using the pattern we identified.
