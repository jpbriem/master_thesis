LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.
<</SYS>>

train input:
a, a, a
b, a, a
a, b, a
train output:
b, b
End of example.
train input:
a, c, a
c, a, a
a, c, a
train output:
c, c, c
End of example.
train input:
a, h, a
a, a, a
a, a, a
train output:
h
End of example.
train input:
a, i, a
i, i, a
i, a, a
train output:
i, i, i, i
End of example.
test input:
e, e, a
e, a, e
a, a, e

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply replacing each letter in the input with the next letter in the alphabet (ignoring any duplicates). So, if we apply this pattern to the test input, we get:

Test output: e, e, e, e

2. Second example:
This pattern seems to involve repeating the first letter of the input sequence twice, followed by the second letter once, and then repeating the entire process again. Therefore, for the test input:

Test output: e, e, a, a, e, e

3. Third example:
The pattern here involves replacing each letter in the input with the next letter in the alphabet, but only if it's not the same letter that was just used. If the same letter is used again, nothing happens. Applying this pattern to the test input gives us:

Test output: e, e, a, a, e, e

4. Fourth example:
This pattern involves applying a simple rotation (clockwise) to the input sequence before producing the output. For the test input:

Test output: e, e, a, a, e, e

Based on these observations, I believe the correct answer is:

Test output: e, e, a, a, e, e

Please let me know if my reasoning is correct or if there's anything else I can help you with!
