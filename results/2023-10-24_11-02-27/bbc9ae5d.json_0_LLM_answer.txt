LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

b, b, a, a, a, a
train output:
b, b, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, a, a, a

End of example.
train input:

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's start by analyzing the patterns in the training examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply repeating the previous row twice. So, if the input is `b, b, a, a, a, a`, the output would be `b, b, b, a, a, a`.
2. Second example:
In this case, the pattern seems to be alternating between two different rows. Specifically, the output for each input is either the same as the previous input or the next letter in the alphabet (e.g., `a` after `c`). Therefore, if the input is `c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a`, the output would be `c, a, a, a, a, a, a`.
3. Third example:
This pattern involves repeating the previous row three times, followed by a single letter. So, if the input is `f, f, f, a, a, a, a, a`, the output would be `f, f, f, a, a, a, a`.
4. Fourth example:
The pattern here appears to be simply repeating the previous row twice. Therefore, if the input is `i, i, i, a, a, a, a, a`, the output would be `i, i, i, a, a, a, a`.
5. Fifth example:
In this case, the pattern seems to be based on the number of letters in the input. Specifically, the output for each input is equal to the length of the input plus one. So, if the input is `h, a, a, a, a, a`, the output would be `h, a, a, a, a, a`.

Now that we have identified these patterns, let's apply them to the test input:
```
b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
```
Using the first pattern, we can repeat the previous row twice to get the output:
```
b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
```
Does this match the expected output?

Solution:
b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a
b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a
