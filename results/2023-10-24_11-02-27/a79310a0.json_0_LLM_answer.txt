LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one position to the right, and then applying a simple transformation to each letter based on the following rules:

1. If the input letter is 'i', it becomes the letter 'a' when shifted to the right.
2. If the input letter is not 'i', it remains unchanged.

Using these rules, we can apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output:

Test input: a, a, i, a, a

Applying the pattern:
Shift the input by one position to the right: a, a, i, a, a -> a, a, i, a, a
Transform each letter using the rule above:
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)
i -> a (shifted by one position)
a -> a (unchanged)
a -> a (unchanged)

Therefore, the test output is: a, a, a, a, a.

Solution:
a, a, a, a, a
a, a, c, a, a
a, c, c, a, a
a, a, c, a, a
a, a, a, a, a
