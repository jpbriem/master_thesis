LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle is to reverse the order of the letters in each row to get the corresponding output.

Here's how it works:

1. For each row in the input, reverse the order of the letters (i.e., if the row is "a, b, c", the reversed row would be "c, b, a").
2. Apply this modified row to the output sequence using the same operation (i.e., if the output sequence is "d, d, d", applying the reversed row "c, b, a" would result in "c, b, d").

Using this pattern, we can now solve the test input:

Test input: a, a, f
Flip the rows:
a, f, a
Reverse the order of the letters:
c, b, d
Apply the modified row to the output sequence:
c, b, d

Therefore, the test output is "c, b, d".

Solution:
d, d, d
c, c, c
e, e, e
