LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve the puzzle together. Based on the patterns you provided, I will now explain how to find the output for the test input.

For the test input `j, b, c, i, e, j, i, c, b`, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the first letter that appears twice in the input, which is `j`.
2. Replace every occurrence of `j` with the corresponding letter in the output, which is `g`. So, the output for the first letter `j` is `g`.
3. Repeat step 2 for the next letter `b`, which gives us `d`.
4. For the third letter `c`, replace it with the corresponding letter in the output, which is `e`.
5. Next, we have `i`, which corresponds to the letter `h` in the output.
6. Now, we come to the fifth letter `j`, which corresponds to the letter `d` in the output.
7. Finally, for the last letter `b`, replace it with the corresponding letter in the output, which is `h`.

So, the output for the test input `j, b, c, i, e, j, i, c, b` is `g, d, e, h, d, h, b`.

Let me know if you want me to explain any further or if you have any questions!
