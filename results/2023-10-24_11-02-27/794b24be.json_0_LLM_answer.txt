LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's start by analyzing the patterns in the training examples:

1. In each example, there are three inputs (or rows) and three corresponding outputs (or columns).
2. Each input consists of a sequence of letters (either 'a' or 'b'), and each output also consists of a sequence of letters.
3. The pattern seems to be that each input is transformed into its corresponding output by replacing every occurrence of 'a' with 'c'.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: a, b, a
a, a, a
a, b, a

Using the pattern we just identified, we can transform the input as follows:

a -> c
b -> c
a -> c

So, the output for the test input would be:

c, c, c
a, c, a
a, c, a

Is this correct?

Solution:
c, c, a
a, a, a
a, a, a
