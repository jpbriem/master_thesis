LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

train input:
a, f, a
f, f, f
a, f, a
train output:
a, a, b, c, a, a
a, a, c, b, a, a
b, c, b, c, b, c
c, b, c, b, c, b
a, a, b, c, a, a
a, a, c, b, a, a
End of example.
train input:
f, a, a
a, f, a
a, a, f
train output:
b, c, a, a, a, a
c, b, a, a, a, a
a, a, b, c, a, a
a, a, c, b, a, a
a, a, a, a, b, c
a, a, a, a, c, b
End of example.
train input:
a, f, a
a, f, f

LLM answer:
  Great! Based on the provided examples, I can see that the pattern for this puzzle involves shifting the input by one letter to the right each time, while also changing the top row of the input based on the following rules:

1. If the top row of the input is "a", then the corresponding output will be "a".
2. If the top row of the input is "f", then the corresponding output will be the next letter in the alphabet (i.e., "b", "c", etc.).
3. If the top row of the input is anything else, then it will remain unchanged.

Using this pattern, we can now apply it to the final test input:

Test input: a, a, a

Shifting the input by one letter to the right each time, we get:

Output: a, a, a

So the test output is simply "a" repeated three times.

Solution:
a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a
a, a, b, c, a, a
a, a, c, b, a, a
b, c, b, c, b, c
c, b, c, b, c, b
