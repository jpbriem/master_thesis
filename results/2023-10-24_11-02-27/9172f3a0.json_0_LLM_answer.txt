LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's solve this puzzle together. From the information provided, we can see that each row in the input represents a different letter, and each column represents a different position on the grid. The goal is to find the pattern that takes the input row and transforms it into the corresponding output row.

To start, let's analyze the first example:

train input: `d, d, a`
train output: `d, d, d, d, d, d, a, a, a`

From the output, we can see that every time there is an 'd' in the input, it becomes 'd' in the output. And whenever there is an 'a', it becomes another 'a'. So, if we take the input `a`, it will become `a` in the output.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the test input `a, b, a`:

Input: `a, b, a`
Output: `a, b, a` (since every 'b' becomes 'b')

Great! Now we have found the pattern for the first example. Let's move on to the second example:

train input: `d, a, c`
train output: `d, d, d, a, a, c, c, c`

In this case, every time there is a 'd', it becomes 'd' in the output. Whenever there is an 'a', it becomes another 'a'. And when there is a 'c', it becomes another 'c'. So, if we take the input `a`, it will become `a` in the output.

Let's apply this pattern to the test input `a, a, g`:

Input: `a, a, g`
Output: `a, a, g` (since every 'a' becomes another 'a')

Excellent! We have now solved both examples using the same pattern. Can you apply this pattern to the remaining test input `a, a, a`?

Solution:
a, a, a, b, b, b, a, a, a
a, a, a, b, b, b, a, a, a
a, a, a, b, b, b, a, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, a, g, g, g
a, a, a, a, a, a, g, g, g
a, a, a, a, a, a, g, g, g
g, g, g, b, b, b, a, a, a
g, g, g, b, b, b, a, a, a
g, g, g, b, b, b, a, a, a
