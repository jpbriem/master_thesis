LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's break down the patterns in each example:

Example 1:
The pattern in this example is that for every input row, there is always one "a" followed by one or more "d"s. Additionally, the last two input rows have an extra "a" at the end. Therefore, the output for each input row can be obtained by replacing each "d" with another "a". So, the output for the input "a, d, a" would be "a, a, a, a".

Example 2:
In this example, the pattern is that for every input row, there are three "a"s followed by either one or two "i"s, and then one or more "f"s. Additionally, the last input row has only one "a" at the end. Therefore, the output for each input row can be obtained by replacing each "i" with another "a", and then replacing each "f" with another "a". So, the output for the input "a, a, i, a" would be "a, a, a, a, a, a".

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test input:
a, a, b, a, a
a, a, b, a, a
a, g, g, g, a
a, a, b, g, a
a, a, a, a, a

Using the first example, we can replace each "b" with another "a":

Output: a, a, a, a, a, a

Using the second example, we can replace each "g" with another "a":

Output: a, a, a, a, a, a

So, the test output for the given test input is "a, a, a, a, a, a".
