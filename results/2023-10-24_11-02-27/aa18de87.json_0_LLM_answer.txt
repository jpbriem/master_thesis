LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's start by analyzing the patterns in the training examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simple substitution, where each letter in the input is replaced by the corresponding letter in the output. For example, 'a' in the input becomes 'a' in the output, and 'd' becomes 'd'.
2. Second example:
This pattern involves a combination of substitution and rotation. In this case, every second letter in the input is rotated by one position (clockwise), while the remaining letters remain unchanged. For instance, 'e' in the input becomes 'c', and 'a' becomes 'a'.
3. Third example:
Here, we have a more complex pattern involving both substitution and rotation. Every third letter in the input is rotated by two positions (counterclockwise), while the remaining letters remain unchanged. For example, 'a' becomes 'a', 'e' becomes 'c', and 'i' becomes 'i'.
4. Fourth example:
In this case, we have another combination of substitution and rotation. Every fourth letter in the input is rotated by three positions (counterclockwise), while the remaining letters remain unchanged. For instance, 'a' becomes 'a', 'e' becomes 'c', and 'i' becomes 'i'.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the test input:

Test input: a, a, g, a, a, a, a, g

Using the first pattern from the first example, we can replace each letter in the input with the corresponding letter in the output:

a → a
a → a
g → g
a → a
a → a
a → a
g → g

So, the output for the test input is:

a, a, g, a, a, a, a, g

What do you think? Did we correctly solve the puzzle using the patterns observed in the training examples?

Solution:
a, a, g, c, c, c, c, c, g
a, g, c, g, c, c, c, g, a
g, c, c, c, g, c, g, a, a
a, a, a, a, a, g, a, a, a
