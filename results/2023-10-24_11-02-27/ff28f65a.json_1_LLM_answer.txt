LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! You have been provided with a set of training inputs and outputs, along with a test input. To solve this puzzle, you need to identify the step-by-step pattern that transforms the input into the corresponding output.

From the examples you've provided, it seems like the pattern involves shifting the letters in the input by one position to the right, while also changing the color of some of the letters based on a specific rule. For instance, in the first example, the letter "a" turns into "b" if it is followed by another "a".

Here's how you can apply this pattern to the test input:

Test input: a, a, a, a, a, a, a

Step 1: Shift the first "a" to the right by one position, so it becomes "b".

Input: b, a, a, a, a, a, a

Step 2: Change the color of the second "a" to blue (since it is followed by another "a").

Input: b, a, b, a, a, a, a

Step 3: Shift the third "a" to the right by one position, so it becomes "b".

Input: b, b, a, a, a, a, a

Step 4: Change the color of the fourth "a" to green (since it is followed by another "a").

Input: b, b, b, a, a, a, a

Step 5: Shift the fifth "a" to the right by one position, so it becomes "b".

Input: b, b, b, b, a, a, a

Step 6: Change the color of the sixth "a" to red (since it is followed by another "a").

Input: b, b, b, b, b, a, a

Step 7: Shift the seventh "a" to the right by one position, so it becomes "b".

Input: b, b, b, b, b, b, a

Step 8: Apply the same rules to the eighth "a", which becomes "b".

Input: b, b, b, b, b, b, b

Therefore, the output for the test input is:

Output: b, b, b, b, b, b, b

Congratulations! You have successfully solved the puzzle.
