LLM prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are given a puzzle with a series of train input and train output pairs as examples. Your task is to identify the step-by-step pattern to get the output from its input. Then, apply the pattern to the final test input to get the test output. The inputs and outputs are all in the form of rows of letters, representing a 2D grid.

LLM answer:
  Great! Let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples:

1. First example:
The pattern appears to be simply reversing the order of the letters in the input row. So, if the input is `c, a, c`, the output would be `b`.
2. Second example:
In this case, the pattern seems to be replacing each letter in the input row with the next letter in the alphabet. So, if the input is `c, a, a`, the output would be `h`.
3. Third example:
This time, the pattern involves repeating the first letter of the input row twice. If the input is `c, a, c`, the output would be `b`.
4. Fourth example:
Here, the pattern consists of alternating between two letters (in this case, `c` and `a`). If the input is `c, c, a`, the output would be `h`.
5. Fifth example:
Similar to the previous one, this pattern also involves alternating between two letters. If the input is `c, a, c`, the output would be `b`.
6. Final test input:
If we apply the same pattern to the test input `c, a, c`, the output would be `[b]`.

So, the overall pattern that emerges from these examples is:

Input → Reverse/Alternate letters in the input row → Output

I hope this helps you solve more puzzles!
