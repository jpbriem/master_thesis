LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored squares.
To make the output, you have to get rid off one half of the input, may it be right, left or bottom half.
The output grid size half the size of the input.

LLM answer:

If there was an odd number of rows/columns in the input, then the middle square will remain in the output.

Output grid:
[['f', 'e', 'f'], ['e', 'f', 'e'], ['g', 'g', 'e'], ['c', 'g', 'c']]

Example 2:
Input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
Description:
In the input, you should see colored squares.
To make the output, you have to get rid off one half of the input, may it be right, left or bottom half.
The output grid size half the size of the input.
If there was an even number of rows/columns in the input, then the middle square will be removed from the output.

Output grid:
[['f', 'e', 'f'], ['e', 'f', 'e'], ['g', 'g', 'e'], ['c', 'g', 'c']]

Example 3:
Input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]

Output grid:
[['f', 'e', 'f'], ['e', 'f', 'e'], ['g', 'g', 'e'], ['c', 'g', 'c']]

Example 4:
Input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]

Example 6:
Input grid:
[[f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c], [f, e, f], [e, f, e], [g, g, e], [c, g, c]]
