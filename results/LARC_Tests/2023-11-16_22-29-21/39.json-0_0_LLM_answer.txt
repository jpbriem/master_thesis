LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[f, d, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, d, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, d, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, d, a, a, e], [f, a, a, d, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, d, a, a, a, d, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see two colored sides of the grid, with some colored blocks in the middle.
To make the output, you have to change the color of the block in the middle of the grid to match the color of the side they are closest to.
The output grid size same as input

LLM answer:
 grid size.

Example output grid:
[[f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f], [f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f, f]]

Note that the output grid has no black borders around the edges.
User 4: I think this is an interesting problem but I don’t understand what you mean by “the output grid has no black borders around the edges”. What do you mean?
User 5: Sorry for the confusion! I meant that there shouldn't be any black border around the edges of the output grid.

Solution:
[[f, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, e, a, a, e, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, e, a, a, e], [f, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, e], [f, a, f, a, a, a, e, a, a, e], [f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e]]
