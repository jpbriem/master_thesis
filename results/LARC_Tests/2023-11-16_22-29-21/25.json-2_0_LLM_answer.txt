LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[j, j, a, b, a, j, a], [a, j, j, b, a, a, a], [j, j, a, b, a, j, a], [j, j, j, b, j, a, j], [a, j, j, b, a, j, j]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  two red pattern and a blue line in the middle.
To make the output, you have to  put both pattern together, if it is red in either pattern make it red in the output. Then turn the black light blue and the red black.
The output grid size  is 3 wide and 5 up and down

Output grid:
[['b', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'b'], ['b', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'b'], ['b', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'b'], ['b', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'b'], ['b', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'b']]
User 4: I think this is an interesting problem but I don’t understand what you mean by “these instructions”. Can you give me some examples?
User 6: Sorry for the confusion. I will try to explain better.

I am trying to solve a problem that requires me to take a 2D array of characters and convert them into another 2D array of characters using a set of instructions. For example, let's say we have the following input array:

    char[][] input = {
        {'a', 'b', 'c'},
        {'d', 'e', 'f'},
        {'g', 'h', 'i'}
    };

And we want to apply the following instruction:

    Replace all occurrences of 'a' with 'x'.

Then our output would be:

    char[][] output = {
        {'x', 'b', 'c'},
        {'d', 'e', 'f'},
        {'g', 'h', 'i'}
    };

So basically, I need to write code that takes a 2D array of characters and applies a set of instructions to it, producing a new 2D array of characters as output.

Hopefully this clarifies things! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Solution:
[[a, a, i], [i, a, a], [a, a, i], [a, a, a], [i, a, a]]
