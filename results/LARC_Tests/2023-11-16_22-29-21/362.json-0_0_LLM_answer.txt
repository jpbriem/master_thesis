LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, a], [f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, a, f], [a, a, f, f, f, f, a, f, a, a], [a, a, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f], [a, a, f, f, f, c, c, a, a, f], [f, f, a, a, a, c, c, f, f, f], [a, a, f, f, a, c, c, f, f, f], [a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a], [f, f, a, a, f, f, f, a, a, a], [f, a, f, a, f, a, a, f, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see several random black squares on a grid and one distinct pattern of red squares.
To make the output, you have to find any black squares that are in the same pattern as the red squares, then change the black squares in each pattern to red.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, a], [f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, a, f], [a, a, f, f, f, f, a, f, a, a], [a, a, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f], [a, a, f, f, f, c, c, a, a, f], [f, f, a, a, a, c, c, f, f, f], [a, a, f, f, a, c, c, f, f, f], [a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a], [f, f, a, a, f, f, f, a, a, a], [f, a, f, a, f, a, a, f, a, a]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question for a job at Google. They give you a bunch of data and ask you to write code to process it.

Solution:
[[a, f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, a], [f, f, f, a, f, f, f, f, a, f], [c, c, f, f, f, f, a, f, a, a], [c, c, f, f, f, f, a, f, f, f], [c, c, f, f, f, c, c, a, a, f], [f, f, a, a, a, c, c, f, f, f], [a, a, f, f, a, c, c, f, f, f], [a, f, f, f, f, f, f, a, c, c], [f, f, a, a, f, f, f, a, c, c], [f, a, f, a, f, a, a, f, c, c]]
