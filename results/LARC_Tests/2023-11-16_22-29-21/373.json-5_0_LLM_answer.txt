LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see three gray lines of differing lengths on a black background.
To make the output, you have to change the color of the lines. The longest line should be blue. The middle length should be colored yellow. The shortest line should be red.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, b, y, r, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

Note that the order of the instructions does not matter. For example, you can first change the color of the shortest line to red, then change the color of the medium line to yellow, and finally change the color of the longest line to blue.

Another example:
Input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Description:
In the input, you should see three gray lines of differing lengths on a black background.
To make the output, you have to change the color of the lines. The longest line should be blue. The middle length should be colored yellow. The shortest line should be red.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid.

Output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, f, f, f, f, f], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [f, f, f, f, f, b, y, r, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]

Note that the order of the instructions does not matter. For example, you can first change the color of the shortest line to red, then change the color of the medium line to yellow, and finally change the color of the longest line to blue.
