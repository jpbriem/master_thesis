LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, h, h, b, h], [i, b, h, h, h], [i, h, b, h, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see blue and yellow colors
To make the output, you have to change the yellow grids into grey one
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[b, g, g, b, g], [i, b, g, g, g], [i, g, b, g, i]]

Example 2:
Input:
[['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']]
Description:
In the input, you should see black and red colors
To make the output, you have to change the red grids into green ones
The output grid size is the same as the input grid size

Output:
[['a','g','a'],['a','a','g']]

Constraints:
1 <= rows, columns <= 50
rows * columns <= 10^4
User Input Format:
First line contains the number of rows and columns of the input grid
Second line contains the input grid
Third line contains the description

Sample Output:
{
    "input_grid": [[b, h, h, b, h], [i, b, h, h, h], [i, h, b, h, i]],
    "instructions": "In the input, you should see blue and yellow colors\nTo make the output, you have to change the yellow grids into grey one\nThe output grid size is the same as the input grid size",
    "output_dimension": "[3, 5]",
    "test_output": [[b, g, g, b, g], [i, b, g, g, g], [i, g, b, g, i]]
}

Explanation:
The input grid has 3 rows and 5 columns. It consists of blue and yellow colors. To make the output, we need to change all the yellow grids into gray ones. The output grid will be the same size as the input grid.

Sample Output:
{
    "input_grid": ['a','b','a'],
    "instructions": "In the input, you should see black and red colors\nTo make the output, you have to change the red grids into green ones\nThe output grid size is the same as the input grid size",
    "output_dimension": "[3]",
    "test_output": ['a','g','a']
}

Explanation:
The input grid has 3 rows and 1 column. It consists of black and red colors. To make the output, we need to change all the red grids into green ones. The output grid will be the same size as the input grid.
