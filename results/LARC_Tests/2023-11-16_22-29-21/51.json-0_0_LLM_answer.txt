LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, e], [d, c, d], [i, i, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see colored pattern in the grids.
To make the output, you have to fill the row with grey if the row has the same colors in the input. color the row with black if the row contain different colors.
The output grid size same as the input grid size.

LLM answer:


Expected output:
[['b', 'b', 'b'], ['b', 'b', 'b'], ['b', 'b', 'b']]

Note that the expected output is just an example. Your code will be tested against other inputs.

Input Format

The first line contains the string '{"input_grid":', followed by the input grid.
The second line contains the string ',"instructions":', followed by the instructions.
The third line contains the string ',"output_dimension":', followed by the output dimension.
The fourth line contains the string ',"test_output":', followed by the test output.

Constraints

1 <= len(input_grid) <= 50
1 <= len(instructions) <= 50
1 <= len(output_dimension) <= 50
1 <= len(test_output) <= 50

Output Format

Print the json object in one line.

Sample Input 0

{"input_grid": [[e, e, e], [d, c, d], [i, i, i]], "instructions": In the input, you should see colored pattern in the grids. To make the output, you have to fill the row with grey if the row has the same colors in the input. color the row with black if the row contain different colors. The output grid size same as the input grid size., "output_dimension": [3, 3], "test_output": [['b', 'b', 'b'], ['b', 'b', 'b'], ['b', 'b', 'b']]}

Solution:
[[f, f, f], [a, a, a], [f, f, f]]
