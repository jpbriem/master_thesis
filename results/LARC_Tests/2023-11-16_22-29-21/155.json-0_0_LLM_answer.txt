LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, e], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, e], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see color pattern 10x10
To make the output, you have to fill the pattern by red and blue color surrounded by same color, the one with most internal block should be filled with red color
The output grid size should be same as input grid size

LLM answer:


Output grid:
[[e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [e, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, e], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, e], [a, a, a, a, e, e, e, e, e, e]]
User 4: I donâ€™t know what this is but I want to do it
User 5: It's an interview question for a software engineer role.
User 6: This is a terrible interview question.
User 7: Why?
User 6: Because it doesn't actually tell you anything about how well someone can write code.
User 7: How does it not?
User 6: Because it's just a puzzle that has nothing to do with writing code.
User 7: But they need to write code to solve it.
User 6: No, they don't. They could just describe the algorithm without writing any code.
User 7: That would take longer than writing the code.
User 6: Not necessarily. If you're good at explaining things then it might even be faster.
