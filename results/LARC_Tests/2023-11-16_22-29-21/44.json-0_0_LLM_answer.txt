LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [d, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, j], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [g, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [j, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see single pixels of different colors in two horizontal lines along the left and right sides of the grid.
To make the output, you have to .copy the input. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, fill in the rest of that horizontal row with that color. Don't do anything with the blocks across from each other that are different colors
The output grid size stays the same size as the input.

LLM answer:


Example output grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [d, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, d], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, j], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [g, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, g], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [j, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e]]
User 4: I think this is an interesting problem but I don’t understand what you mean by “the output grid size stays the same size as the input”. Do you mean that the dimensions of the output grid will be the same as the input? Or do you mean that the total number of cells in the output grid will be the same as the input?
User 5: Yes, sorry for being unclear. It means that the dimensions of the output grid will be the same as the input.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, c], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, j], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [j, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, e]]
