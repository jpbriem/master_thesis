LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, b, a], [a, a, a], [a, b, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid with between 1 to 4 blue squares in it.
To make the output, you have to count the number of blue squares in the input. You will need this same number of squares in the output, but the new squares will become red and will be relocated in the following order until you have used the same number of squares that you counted; First red square goes in top left; second red square (if any) goes if top middle; third red square (if any) goes in top right and fourth red square (if any) goes in middle of grid.
The output grid size is the same size as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Expected output:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'a']]

Note:
If there are no blue squares in the input, then the output should contain no red squares.
If there are more than four blue squares in the input, then the output should contain exactly four red squares.
If there are less than four blue squares in the input, then the output should contain exactly those many red squares.

Input Description:
The input description consists of two parts:

A list of instructions describing how to transform the input grid into the output grid. Each instruction has one of the following forms:

"Move <color> from <position> to <newPosition>" - Move all occurrences of the specified color from the specified position to the specified new position. If the specified color does not exist at the specified position, do nothing.

"Replace <oldColor> with <newColor> at <position>" - Replace all occurrences of the old color at the specified position with the new color. If the specified color does not exist at the specified position, do nothing.

"Remove <color> from <position>" - Remove all occurrences of the specified color from the specified position. If the specified color does not exist at the specified position, do nothing.

An integer indicating the number of rows in the output grid.

An integer indicating the number of columns in the output grid.

"Remove <color> from <position>" - Remove all occurrences of the specified color from the specified position. If the specified color does not exist at the specified position, do nothing.

An integer indicating the number of rows in the output grid.

An integer indicating the number of columns in the output grid.

Example Input:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'a']]

Instructions:
In the input, you should see a 3x3 grid with between 1 to 4 blue squares in it.
To make the output, you have to count the number of blue squares in the input. You will need this same number of squares in the output, but the new squares will become red and will be relocated in the following order until you have used the same number of squares that you counted; First red square goes in top left; second red square (if any) goes if top middle; third red square (if any) goes in top right and fourth red square (if any) goes in middle of grid.
The output grid size is the same size as the input grid.

Expected Output:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'a']]

Note:
If there are no blue squares in the input, then the output should contain no red squares.
If there are more than four blue squares in the input, then the output should contain exactly four red squares.
If there are less than four blue squares in the input, then the output should contain exactly those many red squares.

Sample Input:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'a']]

Sample Output:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'a']]

Constraints:

The input grid will always have at most 50 rows and 50 columns.
The input grid will always have at most 50 colors.
The input grid will always have at least one color.
The input grid will always have at most 50 unique colors.
The input grid will always have at
