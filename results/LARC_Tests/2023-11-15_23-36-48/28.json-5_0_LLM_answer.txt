LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, i, b, b, i, a, a, i, a, i, a, a, a, i], [a, b, a, i, i, b, a, b, b, c, i, b, b, c, a, c], [a, a, i, i, b, b, i, i, b, b, i, a, i, a, a, b], [b, a, b, a, i, a, b, i, b, a, b, b, i, i, i, a], [i, a, i, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, a, c], [b, a, i, d, c, a, i, b, b, b, a, b, a, d, a, a], [a, i, i, d, i, b, a, i, c, i, b, c, i, d, b, i], [b, a, i, d, i, c, a, c, a, b, b, i, b, d, i, i], [a, i, a, d, a, b, i, i, b, b, i, b, i, d, c, b], [b, a, a, d, a, b, i, i, a, i, a, c, a, d, i, b], [a, i, i, d, a, i, i, c, i, i, i, i, i, d, i, i], [b, b, b, d, i, a, c, a, a, a, a, i, i, d, i, a], [b, i, a, d, a, c, i, i, b, c, a, a, c, d, i, b], [i, b, b, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, a, c], [i, b, a, a, a, a, i, i, a, b, c, i, i, i, b, i], [i, b, a, a, b, b, i, a, b, c, i, b, a, b, c, a], [i, a, i, c, i, a, i, c, a, b, i, b, i, b, i, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see complex color pattern with a distinctive rectangle of a single color
To make the output, you have to copy the grid inside the rectangle
The output grid size will be the size of the area inside the rectangle
