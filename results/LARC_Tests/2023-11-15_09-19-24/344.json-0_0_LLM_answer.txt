LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, c, a, a, a, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see two grey pixels and three red pixels
To make the output, you have to extend each red dot straight up so it forms a vertical line. The red pixel must change direction as it reaches the grey pixel to the right and continue straight up.
The output grid size is the same as the input size

LLM answer:
.

Example of what the output could look like: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, c, a, a, a, c, a]]

Note that the order of the instructions does matter.
Also, please provide an explanation for your answer.

Answer:
{
"input_grid": "A 3x9 grid with values 'a' and 'c'. Two rows contain three 'a's and one 'c' each, while the third row contains two 'a's and one 'c'.",
"instructions": "Extend each red dot (represented by 'c') straight up so it forms a vertical line. The red pixel must change direction as it reaches the gray pixel (represented by 'a') to the right and continue straight up.",
"output_dimension": "3x9",
"test_output": [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, f, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, f, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, c, a, a, a, c, a]]
}
Explanation:
The input grid has three red pixels (represented by 'c') and two gray pixels (represented by 'a'). According to the instructions, we need to extend each red dot straight up so that it forms a vertical line. As the red pixel reaches the gray pixel to the right, it changes direction and continues straight up.

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, which is 3x9. The first two rows remain unchanged because there are no red pixels in those rows. In the third row, the two red pixels are extended straight up, changing direction at the gray pixel, forming two vertical lines. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

Solution:
[[a, a, c, a, a, c, a, a, c, a], [a, a, c, a, a, c, a, a, c, a], [a, a, c, a, a, c, a, f, c, a], [a, a, c, a, a, c, a, a, c, a], [a, f, c, a, a, c, a, a, c, a], [a, c, c, a, a, c, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, a, f, c, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, a, c, c, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, a, c, a, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, a, c, a, a, a, c, a]]
