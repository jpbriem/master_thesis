LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[b, b, b, b, a], [a, a, b, a, b], [a, b, a, a, a], [a, b, a, a, b], [a, a, b, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a grid with blue,green,or red squares
To make the output, you have to make a gray grid with four black corner squares if the input is blue squares.if the input is red squares,make a make a gray grid with the bottom right and bottom left black and the middle left and middle right black. if the input is green squares,make a gray with a 2x2 black square in the top left
The output grid size is 3x3

LLM answer:

If there is no matching description, please provide an empty list [] for the 'test_output' field.

Example of valid JSON response:
{
"input_grid": "A 5x5 grid with alternating blue and green squares",
"instructions": "Make a 3x3 gray grid with a 2x2 black square in the top left if the input is green squares, else make a 3x3 gray grid with four black corner squares",
"output_dimension": "3x3",
"test_output": [[["gray", "gray", "gray"], ["gray", "black", "gray"], ["gray", "gray", "gray"]], [["gray", "gray", "gray"], ["gray", "black", "gray"], ["gray", "gray", "gray"]], [["gray", "gray", "gray"], ["gray", "black", "gray"], ["gray", "gray", "gray"]]]
}
Note that the above example has three rows and three columns, with each element being a list of three strings representing the color of each cell in the grid. The first and third elements of each list are always "gray", while the second element is either "black" or "gray". This is just one possible way to represent a 3x3 grid with this particular transformation; other ways of encoding the output grid are also acceptable.

Solution:
[[a, f, a], [f, f, f], [a, f, a]]
