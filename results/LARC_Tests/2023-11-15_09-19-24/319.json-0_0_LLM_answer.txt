LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, c, a], [a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a], [a, c, a, c, a, c, a, c, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 4 red bars that rise upward from the bottom of the grid in different heights.
To make the output, you have to change the lower half of the red bars to light blue and the upper half remain red.  If there are an even number of squares in the bar, the red squares and light blue squares should be even.  If there are an odd number of squares in a bar, there should be one more upper red squares than there are lower blue squares.
The output grid size is the same as the input grid.

LLM answer:


Example of what the output could look like: [[a, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a], [a, e, a, d, a, a, a, a, a]]
Note: The above example is just one possible way to fulfill the requirements of the problem statement. Your solution may differ slightly but should still meet all the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, c, a, c, a, a, a, a, a], [a, i, a, c, a, a, a, c, a], [a, i, a, i, a, a, a, c, a], [a, i, a, i, a, a, a, c, a], [a, i, a, i, a, c, a, i, a], [a, i, a, i, a, i, a, i, a]]
