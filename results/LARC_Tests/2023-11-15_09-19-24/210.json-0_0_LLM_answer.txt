LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[d, d], [d, a], [d, d]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see four black box and two colored box
To make the output, you have to  add reverse input on the back then do two more time
The output grid size doubled in back twice in down

LLM answer:
ward direction

Example:
Input Grid: [[d, d], [d, a], [d, d]]
Output Grid: [[[d, d], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]], [[d, d], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]]]
Explanation:
First, we take the input grid and reverse it horizontally. This gives us:
[[d, a], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]]
Then, we repeat this process two more times, each time reversing the previous result horizontally. This gives us:
[[[d, d], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]], [[d, d], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]]]
Finally, we double the size of the grid in both dimensions, giving us our final output grid:
[[[d, d], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]], [[d, d], [d, d], [d, d], [d, d]]]
Note that the resulting grid has double the number of rows and columns compared to the original input grid.

Solution:
[[d, d, d, d], [a, d, d, a], [d, d, d, d], [d, d, d, d], [a, d, d, a], [d, d, d, d], [d, d, d, d], [a, d, d, a], [d, d, d, d]]
