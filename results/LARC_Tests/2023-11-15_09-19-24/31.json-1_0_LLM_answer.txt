LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, c, a, e, d], [f, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [f, c, a, e, a], [f, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see  grids of squares with colored square scattered.
To make the output, you have to  think of the grid as a black field and as the colored squares as being objects floating in space. Gravity is suddenly turned on and all of the block fall vertically to the bottom.  That produces the correct output grid.
The output grid size  doesn't change from the input.

LLM answer:


Example of what the input could look like:
[['a', 'c', 'a', 'e', 'd'], ['f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'a'], ['f', 'c', 'a', 'e', 'a'], ['f', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']]

Note that the above description is just an example, your task is to follow the instructions in the problem statement to generate the output for any valid input.

Input Grid: [[a, c, a, e, d], [f, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [f, c, a, e, a], [f, a, a, a, a]]

Output: {
"input_grid": "A 5x5 grid with letters a, c, e, d, f, and g",
"instructions": "Gravity is suddenly turned on and all of the blocks fall vertically to the bottom.",
"output_dimension": "5x5",
"test_output": [[a, c, a, e, d], [f, a, a, a, a], [a, a, g, a, a], [f, c, a, e, a], [f, a, a, a, a]]
}

Explanation:
The input grid has 5 rows and 5 columns, with letters a, c, e, d, f, and g. When gravity is applied, all the blocks fall vertically to the bottom, resulting in the same 5x5 grid, but with the blocks rearranged. Therefore, the output grid is the same as the input grid.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a], [f, a, a, a, a], [f, c, a, e, a], [f, c, g, e, d]]
