LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, b], [b, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see 3x3 grid with some squares filled with the same color and the rest filled with black
To make the output, you have to mirror the grid on the new grid
The output grid size double the height of the input grid and the same width as the input grid

LLM answer:

The top half of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the bottom half of the input grid
The bottom half of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the top half of the input grid
The left half of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the right half of the input grid
The right half of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the left half of the input grid
The center square of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the center square of the input grid
The corners of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the corners of the input grid
The edges of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the edges of the input grid
The remaining cells of the output grid should be filled with the same color as the remaining cells of the input grid

Example of expected output:
[['a', 'a', 'a'], ['a', 'b', 'a'], ['b', 'a', 'a']]
Note that the above example is just one possible solution and there may be other valid solutions depending on how you interpret the instructions.

Solution:
[[a, a, a], [a, a, b], [b, a, a], [b, a, a], [a, a, b], [a, a, a]]
