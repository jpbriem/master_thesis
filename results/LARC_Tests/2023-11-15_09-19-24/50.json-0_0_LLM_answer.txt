LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, e, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, e, e, e, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [a, e, e, e, i, e, e, e, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see a single pattern
To make the output, you have to take the smaller color and shoot it out the top
The output grid size does not change

LLM answer:

The color that gets shot out the top will be the same for all rows
The order of shooting is left to right, then top to bottom
If there are multiple colors in one cell, they get shot out together
If two cells next to each other have the same color, nothing happens
If two cells next to each other do not have the same color, they both get shot out
If a cell has no neighbors with the same color, it stays the same
If a cell has no neighbors at all, it turns black

Example:
Input: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]
Output: [[a, d, g], [b, e, h], [c, f, i]]
Explanation:
The smallest color is 'a'. It gets shot out the top, leaving behind 'b' and 'c'.
The second row doesn't change because there are no colors smaller than 'd'.
The third row also doesn't change because there are no colors smaller than 'g'.
The fourth row doesn't change because there are no colors smaller than 'h'.
The fifth row doesn't change because there are no colors smaller than 'i'.

Note: There may be more than one smallest color. In this case, we choose the first occurring smallest color.

Your task is to provide the output grid based on the given input grid and description.

Solution:
[[a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, e, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, e, e, e, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, e, e, e, e, e, a, a, a, a], [a, e, e, e, i, e, e, e, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]]
