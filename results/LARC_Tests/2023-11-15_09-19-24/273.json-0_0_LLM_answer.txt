LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a], [a, a, f, f, f, f, f, a, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see blue colored blocks are filled in grey colored pattern.
To make the output, you have to put blue blocks if empty blocks that are in the grey pattern are added in vertical and that number should be be added blocks in a horizontal shape in a output
The output grid size will be 3x3

LLM answer:
.

Example:
Input Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, f, a, a, a, f, a, a], [a, a, f, i, i, i, f, a, a]]
Output Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], [i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p]]
Explanation:
The input grid has three rows and four columns. There are two grey blocks in the first row, one in the second row, and three in the third row. In the first column, there are two blue blocks, followed by a single block in the second column, and then another two blocks in the third column. Based on the description, we need to add blue blocks in the empty spaces of the grey pattern. As a result, we get a 3x3 output grid with blue blocks in the places of the original grey blocks, and additional blue blocks added horizontally in the second and fourth columns.

Note: The above explanation is just an example, you can come up with your own way of explaining the problem and solution. Also, please ensure that your answer meets all the requirements mentioned in the question.
