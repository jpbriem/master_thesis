LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, c, c], [a, i, i, i, c, c], [a, i, a, a, a, i], [a, a, a, i, a, a], [i, c, c, a, a, i], [a, c, c, a, a, a], [a, i, a, i, i, a]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see Blue grid and two red squares with the random Black grid.
To make the output, you have to make the color of the square the same color as the square that is five down and three across of the input.
The output grid size 1 grid square.

LLM answer:


Example: If the blue grid is at position (x,y) then the output will be blue at position (x+5, y+3).
If there is no such position, then keep the current cell empty.

Note: There can be multiple squares in the input grid.

Input Grid: [[a, i, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, i, c, c], [a, i, i, i, c, c], [a, i, a, a, a, i], [a, a, a, i, a, a], [i, c, c, a, a, i], [a, c, c, a, a, a], [a, i, a, i, i, a]]
Output Grid: [[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
Expected Output:
{
"input_grid": "Blue grid and two red squares with random Black grid",
"instructions": "Make the color of the square the same color as the square that is five down and three across of the input.",
"output_dimension": "1 grid square",
"test_output": [[a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a]]
}

I am having trouble understanding how to implement this task. Can someone please help me?
