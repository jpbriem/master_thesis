LLM prompt:
You are given a 2D input grid of pixels. The values from 'a' to 'j' represent different colors, where 'a' represents the background. The color mapping is as follows: {'a': 'black', 'b': 'blue', 'c': 'red', 'd': 'green', 'e': 'yellow', 'f': 'gray', 'g': 'magenta', 'h': 'orange', 'i': 'cyan', 'j': 'brown'}.
For example, [['a','b','a'],['a','a','c']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color 'b' at position (1,0) and color 'c' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.

Furthermore, you are given a description to transform the input grid into its output grid.

You are to output only the following in json format: 
{'input_grid': 'describe the input grid and check if it matches the given description', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions step by step provided by the description', 'output_dimension': 'describe the output grid dimension provided by the description', 'test_output': 'transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid'}
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test input grid:
[[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, a, a, a, a, a], [b, b, b, a, b, a, i, a, i, a, a, b, i, a, a, a, a], [b, a, b, a, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, i, a, i, a, a], [b, b, b, a, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, i, a, a], [a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, b, a, i, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, i], [a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, i, a, b, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, b, a, i, a, a, a], [a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a], [a, i, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, b, b, b, b, b, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, b, a], [a, a, a, a, a, i, a, a, a, a, b, i, a, i, a, b, a], [a, a, a, i, i, a, a, i, a, a, b, a, a, a, a, b, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, b, b, b, b, b, b, a], [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, i, i, a, a, a, a, a, a, i]]
Please fill the json fields with content and create the corresponding output grid based on the following description:
In the input, you should see multiple square images on a black background.
To make the output, you have to copy the largest squared border including colored squares inside but make all colored squares the same color as interior squares.
The output grid size the size of the largest squared border.

LLM answer:


Example: If there is a red square in the middle of the image surrounded by blue squares, then the entire region would be filled with red.
If there are two equally sized regions of different colors, then choose one of them randomly.

Note that the output must be a valid JSON object.

Input Grid:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]

Description:
Transform the input grid into an output grid with the following properties:

* The output grid has the same number of rows and columns as the input grid.
* Each cell in the output grid contains the same value as the corresponding cell in the input grid, unless the cell is part of a contiguous region of cells with the same color, in which case the cell takes on the color of the interior cells of that region.
* Regions of cells with the same color are considered to be separate if they are not connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* If there are two equally sized regions of different colors, then choose one of them randomly.

Output Grid:
[['a', 'b', 'a'], ['a', 'a', 'c']]

Explanation:
The input grid has two regions: a red region and a blue region. The red region is surrounded by the blue region. Therefore, the output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid, with each cell having the same value as the corresponding cell in the input grid, except for the red region, which will be filled with the color 'a'.

Please provide the JSON response for this problem.
