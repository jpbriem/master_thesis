The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input sequence from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output sequence by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output sequence [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'test_case_output': 'Create the test case output pixel sequence with the transformed objects as numpy array, e.g. \"[0, 0, ..., 0]\". Use zero-indexing for the object positions and fill unoccupied cells with the background color!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 7], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 7], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 7], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 7], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 7], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 7], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 7], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"description\": {\n    \"Example_1\": \"The object of color 3 and size 3 is moved from starting at index 1 to starting at index 4.\",\n    \"Example_2\": \"The object of color 2 and size 3 is moved from starting at index 0 to starting at index 3.\",\n    \"Example_3\": \"The object of color 3 and size 3 is moved from starting at index 0 to starting at index 3.\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Each object is moved to the right by 3 positions without changing its size or color.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, identify the object and move it to the right by 3 positions.
