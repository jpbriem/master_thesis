prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


You are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input sequence from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output sequence by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output sequence [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'test_case_output': 'Create the test case output pixel sequence with the transformed objects as numpy array, e.g. "[0, 0, ..., 0]". Use zero-indexing for the object positions and fill unoccupied cells with the background color!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 10}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}



Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "Example_1": "In Example_1, the input object's start index increased by 3 (from 4 to 7), while its end index also increased by 3 (from 13 to 16). This resulted in no change in the object's size or color.",
        "Example_2": "Similarly, in Example_2, the input object's start index increased by 3 (from 3 to 6), while its end index also increased by 3 (from 13 to 16). Again, there was no change in the object's size or color."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "For each object in the input sequence, increase the start and end indices by a fixed amount without changing the object's size or color.",
    "instructions": "To transform a new input into its output, follow these steps: (1) Identify the objects in the input sequence, (2) Increase the start and end indices of each object by a fixed amount (in this case, 3), and (3) Return the resulting output sequence.",
    "test_case_input_objects": "Object_1: {'color': 3,'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8,'size': 9}",
    "transformation": "The transformed object will have the same color but with a larger start and end index, effectively shifting it to the right by three units.",
