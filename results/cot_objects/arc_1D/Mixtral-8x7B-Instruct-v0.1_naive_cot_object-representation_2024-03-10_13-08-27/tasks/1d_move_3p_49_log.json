            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nYou are to infer the simplest possible relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input sequence into its test output sequence.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'description': {'Example_1': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW!', 'Example_2': '...'}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the needed transformation actions to transform a new input into its output, think step by step', 'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input sequence from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output sequence, focusing on size, position, color', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output sequence by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output sequence [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'test_case_output': 'Create the test case output pixel sequence with the transformed objects as numpy array, e.g. \"[0, 0, ..., 0]\". Use zero-indexing for the object positions and fill unoccupied cells with the background color!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 29], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 9}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 11}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 29], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 8}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 29], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 8}\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 29], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 16}\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description\": {\n        \"Example_1\": \"In Example_1, the input object's start index increased by 3 (from 6 to 9), while its end index also increased by 3 (from 14 to 17). This resulted in no change in the object's size or color.\",\n        \"Example_2\": \"Similarly, in Example_2, the input object's start index increased by 3 (from 1 to 4), while its end index also increased by 3 (from 11 to 14). Again, there was no change in the object's size or color.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern involves increasing the start and end indices of the input object by a fixed amount, leaving the object's size and color unchanged.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To transform a new input into its output, increase the start and end indices of the input object by a fixed amount, leaving the object's size and color unchanged.\",\n    \"test_case_input_objects\": \"Object_1: {'color': 2,'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 21,'size': 16}\",\n    \"transformation\": \"The output object will have the same color as the input object, but its start and end indices will be increased by a fixed amount, resulting in no change in the object's size.\",\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"Object_1: {'color': 2,'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 24,'size': 16}\",\n    \"test_case_output_dimension\": [1, 29],\n    \"test_case_output\": \"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Description: We explain how the input and output objects differ in the given examples. In both cases, the start and end indices of the object were increased by the same amount, leaving the object's size and color unchanged.\n* Overall Pattern: We describe the general pattern observed in the examples, where the start and end indices of the input object are increased by a fixed amount, leaving the object's size and color unchanged.\n* Instructions: We provide instructions on how to transform a new input into its output, i.e., increase the start and end indices of the input object by a fixed amount, leaving the object's size and color unchanged.\n* Test Case Input Objects: We provide the objects present in the test case input sequence.\n* Transformation: We describe how the output objects should look like, emphasizing their size, position, and color.\n* Transformed Objects: We provide the transformed objects for the test output sequence, following the format used in the test case input.\n* Test Case Output Dimension: We state the dimension of the test case output sequence as a list of integers.\n* Test Case Output: Finally, we create the test case output pixel sequence with the transformed objects as a numpy array, filling unoccupied cells with the background color."
