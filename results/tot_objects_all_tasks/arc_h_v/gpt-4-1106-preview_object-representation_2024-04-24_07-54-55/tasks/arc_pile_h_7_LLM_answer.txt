You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that change have the same color and are not isolated. They are combined into one larger object, with the new object's size being the sum of the original objects' sizes. The new object's position starts from the bottom-left corner of the grid and fills up horizontally towards the right. Isolated objects with unique colors remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, combine all objects of the same color into one object. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects. Position the new combined object in the bottom left corner, starting with the lowest color number, then proceed to place combined objects of the next color to the right of the previous, until all are placed. If an object's color is unique and does not combine with others, it remains unchanged in the output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that change have the same color and are not isolated. They are combined into one larger object, with the new object's size being the sum of the original objects' sizes. The new object's position starts from the bottom-left corner of the grid and fills up horizontally towards the right. Isolated objects with unique colors remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, combine all objects of the same color into one object. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects. Position the new combined object in the bottom left corner, starting with the lowest color number, then proceed to place combined objects of the next color to the right of the previous, until all are placed. If an object's color is unique and does not combine with others, it remains unchanged in the output.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid that share the same color and are not isolated from each other.', 'Combine these identified objects into a single new object, summing their sizes to determine the size of the new object.', 'Position the combined object in the bottom-left corner of the output grid, filling up spaces horizontally.', 'If multiple combined objects are present, place them next to each other starting with the lowest color number on the left, proceeding right.', 'Objects with unique colors remain unchanged and retain their original position in the output grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [3, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_10: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_11: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that change have the same color and are not isolated. They are combined into one larger object, with the new object's size being the sum of the original objects' sizes. The new object's position starts from the bottom-left corner of the grid and fills up horizontally towards the right. Isolated objects with unique colors remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, combine all objects of the same color into one object. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects. Position the new combined object in the bottom left corner, starting with the lowest color number, then proceed to place combined objects of the next color to the right of the previous, until all are placed. If an object's color is unique and does not combine with others, it remains unchanged in the output.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid that share the same color and are not isolated from each other.', 'Combine these identified objects into a single new object, summing their sizes to determine the size of the new object.', 'Position the combined object in the bottom-left corner of the output grid, filling up spaces horizontally.', 'If multiple combined objects are present, place them next to each other starting with the lowest color number on the left, proceeding right.', 'Objects with unique colors remain unchanged and retain their original position in the output grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_10: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_11: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when there are multiple objects with the same color, the condition is based on the color and existence of multiple objects.
overall pattern: Merge all objects of the same color into one object, with size equal to the sum of sizes of all input objects of that color. Position the merged object at the start of the row where the first object of that color appears, left-aligned. Do this for each color that has more than one object.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid by color and count the number of objects for each color.', 'For each color with more than one object, calculate the total size of the new merged object by summing the sizes of all objects of that color.', 'Locate the row of the first appearance of the object of that color.', 'Create a new merged object at the start of that row, left-aligned, with the calculated total size.', 'Replace the original objects of that color with the new merged object in the output grid.', 'Retain objects of colors that appear only once in their original position and size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that change have the same color and are not isolated. They are combined into one larger object, with the new object's size being the sum of the original objects' sizes. The new object's position starts from the bottom-left corner of the grid and fills up horizontally towards the right. Isolated objects with unique colors remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, combine all objects of the same color into one object. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects. Position the new combined object in the bottom left corner, starting with the lowest color number, then proceed to place combined objects of the next color to the right of the previous, until all are placed. If an object's color is unique and does not combine with others, it remains unchanged in the output.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid that share the same color and are not isolated from each other.', 'Combine these identified objects into a single new object, summing their sizes to determine the size of the new object.', 'Position the combined object in the bottom-left corner of the output grid, filling up spaces horizontally.', 'If multiple combined objects are present, place them next to each other starting with the lowest color number on the left, proceeding right.', 'Objects with unique colors remain unchanged and retain their original position in the output grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid that share the same color and are not isolated from each other.', 'Combine these identified objects into a single new object, summing their sizes to determine the size of the new object.', 'Position the combined object in the bottom-left corner of the output grid, filling up spaces horizontally.', 'If multiple combined objects are present, place them next to each other starting with the lowest color number on the left, proceeding right.', 'Objects with unique colors remain unchanged and retain their original position in the output grid.']

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, combine all objects of the same color into one object. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects. Position the new combined object in the bottom left corner, starting with the lowest color number, then proceed to place combined objects of the next color to the right of the previous, until all are placed.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

Color 9 has 2 objects with a combined size of 2, correctly positioned at [0, 0] and [0, 1]. Color 8 has 2 objects with a combined size of 3, correctly positioned at [1, 0], [1, 1], and [1, 2]. Color 1 has 2 objects with a combined size of 3, correctly positioned at [2, 0], [2, 1], and [2, 2]. Finally, color 7 has 2 objects with a combined size of 2, correctly positioned at [3, 0] and [3, 1]. Single objects of other colors are retained in their original positions as required.",

  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps appear to have been applied correctly based on the given overall pattern. The input grid has multiple objects of color 8, color 1, and color 7, which are correctly merged into single objects in the output grid, with their sizes being the sum of the sizes of all input objects of that color. The objects are placed left-aligned on the row where the first object of that color appears in the input grid. The object of color 9 is not merged with any other object because it is the only one of its color, and it remains in its original position and size, which matches the condition that objects of colors that appear only once are to be retained in their original position and size.",
