You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost available position in the same row, maintaining their size and shape unless they merge with an object of the same color, which results in the disappearing of the merged object

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the leftmost side of the grid unless their leftmost pixel is already at column 0; objects of the same color on the same row merge together and align to the leftmost side
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row in the grid, if there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object with continuous coordinates starting from column 0; for all other objects, move them horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid without changing their row



transformation steps: ['Identify objects on the same row with the same color.', 'If objects on the same row share the same color, merge them into a single object.', "Align the merged object's leftmost pixel to column 0, keeping the same row, and extend the object's pixels to the right as needed.", 'For objects that are not merged, move each object horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid without changing their row.', "If an object's leftmost pixel is already at column 0, no horizontal movement is needed."]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects either move to the leftmost column of their row or merge with objects of the same color on the same row to form a continuous line
overall pattern: if an object does not start at the leftmost column it is moved to the leftmost column of its row; if there are multiple objects of the same color on the same row, they merge into one object occupying consecutive columns starting from the leftmost column


transformation steps: [{'step': 'Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'details': 'An object is defined by a contiguous group of non-zero pixels of the same color.'}, {'step': 'Determine the leftmost column position for each row.', 'details': 'This is the target starting column for any objects that need to be moved.'}, {'step': 'For each object, check if it starts at the leftmost column.', 'details': 'If it does, leave it as is.'}, {'step': 'If the object does not start at the leftmost column, move the object to the leftmost column of its row.', 'details': "Adjust the coordinate positions of the object's pixels accordingly."}, {'step': 'If there are multiple objects of the same color on the same row, merge them.', 'details': "Create one continuous object by expanding the first object's size to include the other objects and adjusting the positions of the pixels."}, {'step': 'Ensure the transformed objects do not overlap and remain within the bounds of the grid.', 'details': 'The grid dimensions should not change.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the leftmost side of the grid unless their leftmost pixel is already at column 0; objects of the same color on the same row merge together and align to the leftmost side
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row in the grid, if there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object with continuous coordinates starting from column 0; for all other objects, move them horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid without changing their row


transformation steps: ['Identify objects on the same row with the same color.', 'If objects on the same row share the same color, merge them into a single object.', "Align the merged object's leftmost pixel to column 0, keeping the same row, and extend the object's pixels to the right as needed.", 'For objects that are not merged, move each object horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid without changing their row.', "If an object's leftmost pixel is already at column 0, no horizontal movement is needed."]

input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

transformation steps: ['Identify objects on the same row with the same color.', 'If objects on the same row share the same color, merge them into a single object.', "Align the merged object's leftmost pixel to column 0, keeping the same row, and extend the object's pixels to the right as needed.", 'For objects that are not merged, move each object horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid without changing their row.', "If an object's leftmost pixel is already at column 0, no horizontal movement is needed."]

transformation steps: ['Identify objects on the same row with the same color.', 'If objects on the same row share the same color, merge them into a single object.', "Align the merged object's leftmost pixel to column 0, keeping the same row, and extend the object's pixels to the right as needed.", 'For objects that are not merged, move each object horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid without changing their row.', "If an object's leftmost pixel is already at column 0, no horizontal movement is needed."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [4, 4]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_3': {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid seems to have correctly applied the transformation steps to the test input grid. Each object is analyzed as follows: Object_1 with color 9 is already at column 0 in the input and remains unchanged in the output, which aligns with the fifth transformation step. Object_2 with color 6 is correctly moved to start from column 0 and continues to the right, filling columns 0, 1, and 2, consistent with the fourth transformation step. Object_3 with color 5 moves from coordinate [2,2] to [2,0], which is correct as per the fourth transformation step. Object_4 with color 3 moves from [3,1] to [3,0], which is also consistent with the fourth transformation step. No objects needed to be merged according to the first and second transformation steps since there were no objects of the same color on the same row. Therefore, the test output grid accurately reflects the transformation of the input grid according to the specified rules.",

{
    "test_output_analysis": "The test input grid was transformed correctly according to the overall pattern and the transformation steps. Each object was analyzed for its color and position within the grid. Object_1 with color 9 was already positioned at column 0, so no movement was necessary. Object_2 with color 6 consisted of three connected pixels and was properly moved to the leftmost side of the grid starting from column 0. Object_3 with color 5, a single pixel, was correctly moved to column 0 on the same row. Object_4 with color 3, also a single pixel, was appropriately moved to column 0 on its row. There were no objects of the same color on the same row, so no merging was required. The final positions of the objects match the expected output as per the transformation rules.",
