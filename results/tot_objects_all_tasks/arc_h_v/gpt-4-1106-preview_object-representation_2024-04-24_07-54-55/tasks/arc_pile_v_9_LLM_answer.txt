You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:

	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: (1) Merge objects of the same color that are in the same row, updating their size accordingly. (2) Move objects to the bottom rows of the grid. The number of bottom rows used for positioning the objects is equal to the original number of objects before merging, and the objects maintain their horizontal positions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern: to transform any input into its output: move objects to the bottom rows of the grid; if objects are of the same color, merge them into a single object occupying consecutive cells starting from the leftmost column; all objects maintain their color; the size of merged objects is the sum of the individual sizes



transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the grid based on color and adjacency of pixels.', 'For each object, calculate its size (number of pixels).', 'Determine the bottommost row of the grid (based on grid dimensions).', 'For each object, move it vertically down to the bottommost row or above another object, maintaining its column position.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are present, merge them into a single object. The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects, and it is placed starting from the leftmost column of the objects being merged.', 'Maintain the color of each object during the transformation.', 'Empty cells (background) are filled with 0, and the positions of objects are updated based on their movement to the lower rows of the grid.']

#############################Sample Prompt:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 5]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the bottom rows of the grid; objects of the same color merge and expand their size; objects of different colors do not merge
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output: move objects to the bottom rows of the grid; if objects are of the same color, merge them into a single object occupying consecutive cells starting from the leftmost column; all objects maintain their color; the size of merged objects is the sum of the individual sizes


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the grid based on color and adjacency of pixels.', 'For each object, calculate its size (number of pixels).', 'Determine the bottommost row of the grid (based on grid dimensions).', 'For each object, move it vertically down to the bottommost row or above another object, maintaining its column position.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are present, merge them into a single object. The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects, and it is placed starting from the leftmost column of the objects being merged.', 'Maintain the color of each object during the transformation.', 'Empty cells (background) are filled with 0, and the positions of objects are updated based on their movement to the lower rows of the grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with the same color in the same row are merged. Objects are then moved to the bottom rows of the grid, with the number of bottom rows used for positioning matching the original count of objects pre-merging.

(2) Move objects to the bottom rows of the grid. The number of bottom rows used for positioning the objects is equal to the original number of objects before merging, and the objects maintain their horizontal positions.


transformation steps: ['Identify and count the distinct objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, merge objects that have the same color into a single object and update their size and coordinates accordingly.', 'Move each object to the bottom rows of the grid.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with the same color in the same row are merged. Objects are then moved to the bottom rows of the grid, with the number of bottom rows used for positioning matching the original count of objects pre-merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: (1) Merge objects of the same color that are in the same row, updating their size accordingly. (2) Move objects to the bottom rows of the grid. The number of bottom rows used for positioning the objects is equal to the original number of objects before merging, and the objects maintain their horizontal positions.


transformation steps: ['Identify and count the distinct objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, merge objects that have the same color into a single object and update their size and coordinates accordingly.', 'Move each object to the bottom rows of the grid. The number of bottom rows used for positioning should match the original number of objects before merging.', 'Within these bottom rows, maintain the horizontal position of each object as it was in the input grid.']

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the bottom rows of the grid; objects of the same color merge and expand their size; objects of different colors do not merge
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output: move objects to the bottom rows of the grid; if objects are of the same color, merge them into a single object occupying consecutive cells starting from the leftmost column; all objects maintain their color; the size of merged objects is the sum of the individual sizes


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the grid based on color and adjacency of pixels.', 'For each object, calculate its size (number of pixels).', 'Determine the bottommost row of the grid (based on grid dimensions).', 'For each object, move it vertically down to the bottommost row or above another object, maintaining its column position.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are present, merge them into a single object. The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects, and it is placed starting from the leftmost column of the objects being merged.', 'Maintain the color of each object during the transformation.', 'Empty cells (background) are filled with 0, and the positions of objects are updated based on their movement to the lower rows of the grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}

Object_5 with color 8, consisting of 2 pixels, is correctly placed in the bottom rows but should have been moved to the leftmost available cells after merging with other objects; however, since there is no object of the same color to merge with, the position is correct. The objects of color 4 (Object_6 and Object_7) have been correctly moved to the bottom rows and merged into a single object, but the coordinates are incorrectly placed at [[3, 4], [4, 4]] instead of [[4, 4], [4, 5]] as they should also start from the leftmost column after merging.

The color is maintained during the transformation, and the background is filled with 0s. However, there's a slight inconsistency with Object_1 (color 7): according to the previous examples and the overall pattern, the merged object should start from the leftmost column of the objects being merged. Since both Object_1 and Object_2 (color 7) were in column 0, their merged object should also start from column 0, not column 1 as shown in the output. Therefore, the coordinates for the merged Object_1 should be [[3, 0], [4, 0]] instead of [[4, 0], [4, 1]]. This error affects the overall correctness of the transformation.",
