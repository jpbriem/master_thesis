You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with the same color and in the same column merge into a single object that occupies the bottommost available spaces in that column. Single pixel objects move to the bottom row of their respective column. Elongated vertical objects move down within their column but do not necessarily reach the bottom row
overall pattern: For any input grid, objects merge based on their color and column. Single pixel objects move to the bottom row, elongated vertical objects move down but not necessarily to the bottom row. The resulting object takes the bottommost available spaces in that column



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each column in the grid, check for objects with the same color.', 'Merge objects within the same column that have the same color by updating their coordinates to form a contiguous object.', 'Move single pixel objects to the bottom row of their respective column.', 'Move vertical elongated objects down within their column to occupy the bottommost available spaces, but not necessarily to the bottom row.', 'For merged objects, calculate the new size based on the total number of pixels combined.', 'Update the output grid with merged and moved objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, objects of the same color in the same column should combine and occupy the column from the bottom up. Objects that have no matching color in the same column should move down to the last available space within the same column


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within the same column.', 'For each column, combine these objects starting from the bottom row upward.', 'If an object is alone in its column, move it to the bottom available space within the same column.', 'Repeat this process for each column in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with the same color and in the same column merge into a single object that occupies the bottommost available spaces in that column. Single pixel objects move to the bottom row of their respective column. Elongated vertical objects move down within their column but do not necessarily reach the bottom row
overall pattern: For any input grid, objects merge based on their color and column. Single pixel objects move to the bottom row, elongated vertical objects move down but not necessarily to the bottom row. The resulting object takes the bottommost available spaces in that column


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each column in the grid, check for objects with the same color.', 'Merge objects within the same column that have the same color by updating their coordinates to form a contiguous object.', 'Move single pixel objects to the bottom row of their respective column.', 'Move vertical elongated objects down within their column to occupy the bottommost available spaces, but not necessarily to the bottom row.', 'For merged objects, calculate the new size based on the total number of pixels combined.', 'Update the output grid with merged and moved objects.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_10: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color in the same column combine; if an object's column has no object of the same color, it shifts down to the bottom of the grid
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, objects of the same color in the same column should combine and occupy the column from the bottom up. Objects that have no matching color in the same column should move down to the last available space within the same column


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within the same column.', 'For each column, combine these objects starting from the bottom row upward.', 'If an object is alone in its column, move it to the bottom available space within the same column.', 'Repeat this process for each column in the grid.']

The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each column in the grid, check for objects with the same color.', 'Merge objects within the same column that have the same color by updating their coordinates to form a contiguous object.', 'Move single pixel objects to the bottom row of their respective column.', 'Move vertical elongated objects down within their column to occupy the bottommost available spaces, but not necessarily to the bottom row.', 'For merged objects, calculate the new size based on the total number of pixels combined.', 'Update the output grid with merged and moved objects.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_10: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [6, 6]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_3': {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_5': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_6': {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid has several discrepancies when compared to the expected transformation following the given steps. Firstly, Object_1, which is color 7 in column 0, should be at [[4, 0], [5, 0]], not [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], given that there is a total of 3 pixels and they should occupy the bottommost spaces of the column. Secondly, Object_3 with color 2 in column 2 is incorrectly listed twice with the coordinates [[4, 2], [5, 2], [5, 2]]. This is a clear mistake as the coordinates [5, 2] are repeated and the size should be 2 not 3. Therefore, the correct coordinates should be [[4, 2], [5, 2]] and the size should be 2. For Object_4, with color 9 in column 3, it is correctly placed at the bottom of the column, but the size should be 2, not 1, as there are two pixels of color 9 in the input grid. Lastly, Object_6, with color 4 in column 5, is correctly placed, however, the size should be 1 because there is no other pixel of color 4 in the same column to merge with.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps have not been applied correctly. There are several issues with the test case output. Firstly, the output contains duplicate coordinates for Object_3 ('color': 2), which has two instances of the coordinate [5, 2]. This is incorrect as each pixel should have a unique coordinate. Secondly, the size of Object_3 is listed as 3, but based on the provided coordinates (with the duplicate removed), it should only be 2. Additionally, Object_7 with color 9 has been moved to the bottom row as a single pixel object, which is correct. However, Object_5 with color 2 has been incorrectly merged and moved down to form a three-pixel object. Object_6 with color 4 has been correctly merged into a two-pixel object at the bottom of the column. Objects with color 7 and color 3 have been correctly merged and moved to the bottom of their respective columns, but the starting row for the objects should be 4, not 3, to maintain the size of the objects as 3 pixels each after the merge. Finally, Object_5 with color 8 has been correctly moved to the bottom of its column. Overall, while some objects were transformed correctly, the errors with Object_3's coordinates and size, and the starting row of the merged objects for colors 7 and 3, indicate an incorrect application of the transformation rules.",
