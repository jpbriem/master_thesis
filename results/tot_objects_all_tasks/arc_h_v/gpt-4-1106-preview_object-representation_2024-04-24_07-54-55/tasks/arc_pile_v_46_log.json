The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_9: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects move down until they reach the bottom or another object. If an object moves into the space occupied by a smaller object of the same color, it absorbs that object\noverall pattern: Objects move down one row. If an object of the same color is exactly below, it is absorbed and the absorbing object grows in size. This continues until objects cannot move further down\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['For each object, check if it can move down one row.', 'If the space below an object is occupied by another object of a different color or the bottom, the object stops moving.', 'If the space below an object is occupied by an object of the same color and is smaller or equal in size, the moving object absorbs it and grows in size by the size of the absorbed object.', 'Move the object down one row and repeat the process until it cannot move further.', 'If an object is absorbed, remove it from the list of objects to be processed.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid.

Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Firstly, each object is supposed to move down one row, and if it encounters an object of the same color and smaller or equal in size, it should absorb it. However, Object_4 (color 9) appears to have moved from [0, 2] to [1, 2] rather than [4, 2] while there were no objects of the same color to stop its movement. Object_5 and Object_6 should have combined at [4, 3] as they are of the same color (1) and their sizes are equal, which is correct. Object_7 and Object_8 should also combine at [4, 4] as they are of the same color (5) and Object_8 is larger, which is correct. However, the final size of the combined object should be 1+2=3, not 2+1=3 as the steps indicate that the moving object absorbs the size of the absorbed object, not the other way around. Lastly, Object_2 should have moved to [4, 1] and absorbed Object_3, which is correct, but the size should be 1+1=2, not 2 as indicated.

First, Object_2 and Object_3 of color 7 should have combined into a single object of size 2 at coordinates [[4, 1]], which is correct in the output. However, Object_4 of color 9 should move down to [[1, 2]] and stop, as it does not encounter another object of the same color, which is also correct in the output. Object_5 and Object_6 should have combined into a single object of size 2 at coordinates [[4, 3]], which is correct. Finally, Object_7 and Object_8 should not have combined because Object_8 is larger than Object_7. Object_7 should have moved down to [[1, 4]], and Object_8 should remain at [[3, 4], [4, 4]] with size 2, but in the output, they are incorrectly combined into a single object of size 3 at coordinates [[4, 4]].
