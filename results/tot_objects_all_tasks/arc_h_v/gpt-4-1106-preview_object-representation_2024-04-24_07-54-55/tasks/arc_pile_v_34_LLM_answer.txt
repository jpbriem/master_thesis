You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Objects expand to fill all the vertical space available from their original bottommost pixel to the bottom of the grid.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color in the same column. Move each object down to the bottom or merge them if they align vertically, in which case place the merged object at the bottom of the column. Expand the object's vertical size to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

overall pattern:
conditions: Each color will end up with exactly one object. Objects move to the bottom-most row available for their color. If multiple objects of the same color exist, they merge into a single object at the bottom, expanding upwards to include all their original pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation moves each object to the lowest possible row in the grid, with the bottom-most object of the same color expanding to include all pixels of that color. Objects above the bottom-most object of the same color are removed.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color.', 'For each color, locate the lowest row (highest row index) that contains an object of that color.', 'Move all objects of the same color to this row while preserving their original columns.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are moving to the same row, merge them into a single object by expanding the bottom-most object to include all pixels above it in the same column.', 'Ensure that the transformation preserves the original order of colors in each column.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move downwards, either to the bottommost position of the column they are in, or to merge with another object of the same color in the same column. Merging only occurs if objects are vertically aligned, and the merged object takes the bottommost position that any of them could occupy. Objects expand to fill all the vertical space available from their original bottommost pixel to the bottom of the grid.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color in the same column. Move each object down to the bottom or merge them if they align vertically, in which case place the merged object at the bottom of the column. Expand the object's vertical size to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid by color and coordinates.', 'Determine if objects of the same color are vertically aligned in the same column.', 'For objects that are independent, move each object down to the bottommost position of their column.', 'For objects that are vertically aligned and can merge, combine their size and place the merged object at the bottommost position that any of them could occupy.', "Expand each object's size vertically to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid."]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: Each color will end up with exactly one object. Objects move to the bottom-most row available for their color. If multiple objects of the same color exist, they merge into a single object at the bottom, expanding upwards to include all their original pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation moves each object to the lowest possible row in the grid, with the bottom-most object of the same color expanding to include all pixels of that color. Objects above the bottom-most object of the same color are removed.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color.', 'For each color, locate the lowest row (highest row index) that contains an object of that color.', 'Move all objects of the same color to this row while preserving their original columns.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are moving to the same row, merge them into a single object by expanding the bottom-most object to include all pixels above it in the same column.', 'Ensure that the transformation preserves the original order of colors in each column.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move downwards, either to the bottommost position of the column they are in, or to merge with another object of the same color in the same column. Merging only occurs if objects are vertically aligned, and the merged object takes the bottommost position that any of them could occupy. Objects expand to fill all the vertical space available from their original bottommost pixel to the bottom of the grid.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color in the same column. Move each object down to the bottom or merge them if they align vertically, in which case place the merged object at the bottom of the column. Expand the object's vertical size to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid by color and coordinates.', 'Determine if objects of the same color are vertically aligned in the same column.', 'For objects that are independent, move each object down to the bottommost position of their column.', 'For objects that are vertically aligned and can merge, combine their size and place the merged object at the bottommost position that any of them could occupy.', "Expand each object's size vertically to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid."]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Each color will end up with exactly one object. Objects move to the bottom-most row available for their color. If multiple objects of the same color exist, they merge into a single object at the bottom, expanding upwards to include all their original pixels.
overall pattern: The transformation moves each object to the lowest possible row in the grid, with the bottom-most object of the same color expanding to include all pixels of that color. Objects above the bottom-most object of the same color are removed.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color.', 'For each color, locate the lowest row (highest row index) that contains an object of that color.', 'Move all objects of the same color to this row while preserving their original columns.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are moving to the same row, merge them into a single object by expanding the bottom-most object to include all pixels above it in the same column.', 'Ensure that the transformation preserves the original order of colors in each column.']


Test case:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Objects expand to fill all the vertical space available from their original bottommost pixel to the bottom of the grid.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color in the same column. Move each object down to the bottom or merge them if they align vertically, in which case place the merged object at the bottom of the column. Expand the object's vertical size to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move downwards, either to the bottommost position of the column they are in, or to merge with another object of the same color in the same column. Merging only occurs if objects are vertically aligned, and the merged object takes the bottommost position that any of them could occupy. Objects expand to fill all the vertical space available from their original bottommost pixel to the bottom of the grid.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color in the same column. Move each object down to the bottom or merge them if they align vertically, in which case place the merged object at the bottom of the column. Expand the object's vertical size to fill the column from its original lowest position to the bottom of the grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
