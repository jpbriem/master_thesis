You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost part of their row. Objects of the same color in the same row become adjacent by expansion of the leftmost object. If objects of different colors are in the same row, they merge into one object, take the color of the rightmost object, and move to the leftmost part of the row. Objects that do not have other objects of the same color in their row or are not in the same row as other objects remain unchanged but move to the leftmost part of the row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row. 2. If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color. 3. If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object. 4. Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color combine into a single object starting from column 0. Objects expand to the right to fill the grid until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. Single objects of a color move to the leftmost position available within their row.
overall pattern: For any input grid, identify objects of the same color and combine them into a single object starting from the leftmost column (column 0). Expand objects to the right to fill the grid until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. If there is only one object of a particular color, move it to the leftmost position available within its row.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost part of their row. Objects of the same color in the same row become adjacent by expansion of the leftmost object. If objects of different colors are in the same row, they merge into one object, take the color of the rightmost object, and move to the leftmost part of the row. Objects that do not have other objects of the same color in their row or are not in the same row as other objects remain unchanged but move to the leftmost part of the row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row. 2. If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color. 3. If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object. 4. Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.



transformation steps: ['Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row.', 'If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color.', 'If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object.', 'Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost part of their row. Objects of the same color in the same row become adjacent by expansion of the leftmost object. If objects of different colors are in the same row, they merge into one object, take the color of the rightmost object, and move to the leftmost part of the row. Objects that do not have other objects of the same color in their row or are not in the same row as other objects remain unchanged but move to the leftmost part of the row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row. 2. If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color. 3. If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object. 4. Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.


transformation steps: ['Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row.', 'If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color.', 'If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object.', 'Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.']

#############################Sample Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color combine into a single object starting from column 0. Objects expand to the right to fill the grid until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. Single objects of a color move to the leftmost position available within their row.
overall pattern: For any input grid, identify objects of the same color and combine them into a single object starting from the leftmost column (column 0). Expand objects to the right to fill the grid until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. If there is only one object of a particular color, move it to the leftmost position available within its row.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within the grid.', 'For each color, if multiple objects exist, combine them into a single object starting from the leftmost column (column 0).', 'Expand objects horizontally to the right to fill the grid up to their size limit, or until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid.', 'For single objects of a color, move them to the leftmost available position within their respective row.', 'If an object is already filling an entire row, leave it unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost part of their row. Objects of the same color in the same row become adjacent by expansion of the leftmost object. If objects of different colors are in the same row, they merge into one object, take the color of the rightmost object, and move to the leftmost part of the row. Objects that do not have other objects of the same color in their row or are not in the same row as other objects remain unchanged but move to the leftmost part of the row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row. 2. If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color. 3. If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object. 4. Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.


transformation steps: ['Move all objects to the leftmost part of their row.', 'If objects of the same color are in the same row, expand the leftmost object to the right until it becomes adjacent to the next object of the same color.', 'If objects of different colors are in the same row, merge them into one object, taking the color of the rightmost object.', 'Objects not affected by steps 2 or 3 only execute step 1.']

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

conditions: Objects of the same color combine into a single object starting from column 0. Objects expand to the right to fill the grid until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. Single objects of a color move to the leftmost position available within their row.
overall pattern: For any input grid, identify objects of the same color and combine them into a single object starting from the leftmost column (column 0). Expand objects to the right to fill the grid until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. If there is only one object of a particular color, move it to the leftmost position available within its row.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within the grid.', 'For each color, if multiple objects exist, combine them into a single object starting from the leftmost column (column 0).', 'Expand objects horizontally to the right to fill the grid up to their size limit, or until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid.', 'For single objects of a color, move them to the leftmost available position within their respective row.', 'If an object is already filling an entire row, leave it unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_3': {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_6': {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input grid has been transformed following the overall pattern and transformation steps. Object_1, which is a single object of color 8, was correctly moved to the leftmost available position within its row. Object_2, consisting of color 7, was correctly combined and expanded to the right as expected. Object_3, a single object of color 5, was correctly moved to the leftmost position on its row. Object_4, which had two objects of color 9, was correctly combined into a single object starting from column 0 and expanded to the right, filling three spaces as per the size limit imposed by the number of original objects before encountering another object. Object_6, color 3, was correctly moved to the leftmost position within its row. However, the output is missing the information for Object_5, which should have been combined with Object_4 as they are of the same color (9). This indicates a slight error in the transformation process. The correct output should have Object_4 with color 9's coordinates as [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]] and a size of 4, since the two objects of color 9 should have combined and expanded to the right until they fill the grid or encounter another object. Since there is no other object on row 3, they should fill the entire row.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid generally follows the transformation steps outlined, but there is a mistake in the final positions of the transformed objects. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, objects of the same color should be combined and expanded to the right, starting from the leftmost column. However, Object_4, which is color 9, should have been combined into a single object starting from column 0 and expanded to the right. The correct coordinates for Object_4 should be [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]], with a size of 4. Instead, Object_4 was only expanded to a size of 3 in the test output. Furthermore, Object_5 of color 9 is missing in the transformed objects list, likely due to being combined with Object_4, which is correct. However, the final size of the combined object is incorrect. All other objects were correctly transformed according to the steps.",
