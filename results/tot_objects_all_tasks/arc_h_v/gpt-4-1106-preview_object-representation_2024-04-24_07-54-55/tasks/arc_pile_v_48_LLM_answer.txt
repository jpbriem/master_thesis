You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern: Identify objects with the same colors, merge them by adding their sizes, then shift the merged object or individual objects down until they cannot move further, all while maintaining their horizontal positions

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

transformation steps: ['Identify objects with the same color in the input grid.', 'Merge objects with the same color by adding their sizes together to form a new object.', 'For each merged object or individual object, maintain their horizontal position and shift them down vertically in the grid.', 'Continue shifting each object down until it encounters another object or reaches the bottom of the grid.', 'The new object size is determined by the sum of sizes of merged objects.', 'If an object does not find a matching color to merge with, it simply shifts down in the same horizontal position until it cannot move further.', 'The output grid is then formed by placing the transformed objects at their new positions.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if there are multiple objects of the same color. These objects combine into a single object, which moves to the bottom of the grid. The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, place it at the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position, and adjust its size to be the sum of the original objects' sizes.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'For each set of objects with the same color, calculate the combined size by summing the sizes of all objects in the set.', 'Create a new object with the combined size, keeping the color of the original objects.', 'Move each new combined object to the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position of the first object encountered of that color.', 'For objects with no matching color counterparts, move them down to the available space within their respective columns.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects merge if they have the same color and shift down until they encounter another object or the bottom of the grid, every object that merges expands by the number of units in the merged object
overall pattern: Identify objects with the same colors, merge them by adding their sizes, then shift the merged object or individual objects down until they cannot move further, all while maintaining their horizontal positions


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with the same color in the input grid.', 'Merge objects with the same color by adding their sizes together to form a new object.', 'For each merged object or individual object, maintain their horizontal position and shift them down vertically in the grid.', 'Continue shifting each object down until it encounters another object or reaches the bottom of the grid.', 'The new object size is determined by the sum of sizes of merged objects.', 'If an object does not find a matching color to merge with, it simply shifts down in the same horizontal position until it cannot move further.', 'The output grid is then formed by placing the transformed objects at their new positions.']

#############################Sample Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if there are multiple objects of the same color. These objects combine into a single object, which moves to the bottom of the grid. The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, place it at the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position, and adjust its size to be the sum of the original objects' sizes.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'For each set of objects with the same color, calculate the combined size by summing the sizes of all objects in the set.', 'Create a new object with the combined size, keeping the color of the original objects.', 'Move each new combined object to the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position of the first object encountered of that color.', 'For objects with no matching color counterparts, move them down to the available space within their respective columns.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:

overall pattern: Identify objects with the same colors, merge them by adding their sizes, then shift the merged object or individual objects down until they cannot move further, all while maintaining their horizontal positions


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with the same color in the input grid.', 'Merge objects with the same color by adding their sizes together to form a new object.', 'For each merged object or individual object, maintain their horizontal position and shift them down vertically in the grid.', 'Continue shifting each object down until it encounters another object or reaches the bottom of the grid.', 'The new object size is determined by the sum of sizes of merged objects.', 'If an object does not find a matching color to merge with, it simply shifts down in the same horizontal position until it cannot move further.', 'The output grid is then formed by placing the transformed objects at their new positions.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

Instead, it appears at coordinates [(3,0), (4,0)], which indicates that it has not been shifted down as far as possible. The same applies to the other objects; all should be at the bottom of the grid. This suggests that the transformation steps were not followed correctly for the vertical placement of objects.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if there are multiple objects of the same color. These objects combine into a single object, which moves to the bottom of the grid. The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, place it at the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position, and adjust its size to be the sum of the original objects' sizes.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'For each set of objects with the same color, calculate the combined size by summing the sizes of all objects in the set.', 'Create a new object with the combined size, keeping the color of the original objects.', 'Move each new combined object to the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position of the first object encountered of that color.', 'For objects with no matching color counterparts, move them down to the available space within their respective columns.']

Object_3 with color 1 has been moved down one row, which is correct as it had no matching color counterparts. However, Object_4 with color 5 should be in the same column positions 3 and 4, but it has been incorrectly placed only in position 3. Lastly, Object_5 with color 8 has been combined and moved correctly to the bottom, maintaining its first column position as 4. Overall, there are several errors in the application of the transformation steps.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if there are multiple objects of the same color. These objects combine into a single object, which moves to the bottom of the grid. The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, place it at the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position, and adjust its size to be the sum of the original objects' sizes.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'For each set of objects with the same color, calculate the combined size by summing the sizes of all objects in the set.', 'Create a new object with the combined size, keeping the color of the original objects.', 'Move each new combined object to the lowest possible row in the grid while maintaining the original left-most column position of the first object encountered of that color.', 'For objects with no matching color counterparts, move them down to the available space within their respective columns.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}]
