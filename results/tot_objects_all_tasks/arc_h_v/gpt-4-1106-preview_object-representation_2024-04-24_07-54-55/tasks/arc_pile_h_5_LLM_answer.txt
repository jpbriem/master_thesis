You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to shift to the leftmost position within their row, expand to the left if there is a background, and single pixels disappear unless they are the leftmost in the row or can merge with another object of the same color.
overall pattern: For each row, move or expand objects to the left as far as possible. If an object is a single pixel and not the leftmost, remove it. If two objects of the same color can merge by moving left, do so.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move or expand towards the leftmost column. Objects that are single pixels and not in the leftmost column disappear. Objects may expand by filling in the spaces of objects that have disappeared.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects towards the leftmost column. If an object is a single pixel and not in the leftmost column, remove it. If there is an empty space within the same row between parts of the same object or in a space left by a disappeared object, fill it with the expanding object's color.



transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is a single pixel and not in the leftmost column.', 'If an object meets the above condition, remove it from the grid.', 'For remaining objects, move them horizontally towards the leftmost column until the leftmost pixel of the object is in the leftmost column of the grid.', "If an object is split into multiple disconnected parts, connect these parts by filling in the gaps between them with the object's color, provided the gaps are in the same row.", 'If an object is in the leftmost column but not the full height of the grid, do not move or expand it.', 'For objects that are already in the leftmost column, combine them with any removed objects that were in the same row to expand their size.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}.

#############################Sample Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move or expand towards the leftmost column. Objects that are single pixels and not in the leftmost column disappear. Objects may expand by filling in the spaces of objects that have disappeared.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects towards the leftmost column. If an object is a single pixel and not in the leftmost column, remove it. If there is an empty space within the same row between parts of the same object or in a space left by a disappeared object, fill it with the expanding object's color.


transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is a single pixel and not in the leftmost column.', 'If an object meets the above condition, remove it from the grid.', 'For remaining objects, move them horizontally towards the leftmost column until the leftmost pixel of the object is in the leftmost column of the grid.', "If an object is split into multiple disconnected parts, connect these parts by filling in the gaps between them with the object's color, provided the gaps are in the same row.", 'If an object is in the leftmost column but not the full height of the grid, do not move or expand it.', 'For objects that are already in the leftmost column, combine them with any removed objects that were in the same row to expand their size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_10: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_11: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move or expand towards the leftmost column. Objects that are single pixels and not in the leftmost column disappear. Objects may expand by filling in the spaces of objects that have disappeared.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects towards the leftmost column. If an object is a single pixel and not in the leftmost column, remove it. If there is an empty space within the same row between parts of the same object or in a space left by a disappeared object, fill it with the expanding object's color.


transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is a single pixel and not in the leftmost column.', 'If an object meets the above condition, remove it from the grid.', 'For remaining objects, move them horizontally towards the leftmost column until the leftmost pixel of the object is in the leftmost column of the grid.', "If an object is split into multiple disconnected parts, connect these parts by filling in the gaps between them with the object's color, provided the gaps are in the same row.", 'If an object is in the leftmost column but not the full height of the grid, do not move or expand it.', 'For objects that are already in the leftmost column, combine them with any removed objects that were in the same row to expand their size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_10: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_11: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [6, 6]
transformed objects: [{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}]

Value Outputs:

Objects that were single pixels and not in the leftmost column were appropriately removed (Object_4, Object_6, Object_10, Object_11). Object_1, which was already in the leftmost column, correctly remained unchanged. Object_7 and Object_9 were correctly moved to the leftmost column and expanded to fill the gap left by removed objects (Object_2 and Object_8 for Object_7, and Object_10 for Object_9). However, there is a mistake in the treatment of Object_3. According to the transformation rules, Object_3, being a single pixel not in the leftmost column, should have been removed. Instead, it was merged with Object_1, which is incorrect. The correct transformation for Object_1 should be that it remains as a single pixel in the leftmost column, and the positions [[0,2]] and [[0,5]] should be empty after the transformation due to the removal of Object_2 and Object_3. Consequently, the output for Object_1 is incorrect as it shows three connected pixels instead of one.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid seems to be incorrect. The input grid contains multiple objects, of which some are single pixels not in the leftmost column and thus should be removed according to the transformation steps. Object_4 (color 9), Object_6 (color 3), Object_8 (color 4), Object_10 (color 8), and Object_11 (color 8) fall under this category and should be eliminated. However, the test output grid only shows the removal of Object_4, Object_6, Object_10, and Object_11 but does not remove Object_8 (color 4), which is a single pixel not in the leftmost column. Additionally, the final output for Object_9 (color 2) should consist of two pixels, but they should be at coordinates [[4, 0]] and [[4, 1]], to fill in the space left by the disappearance of Object_10. The test output shows this correctly. However, it seems that Object_7 (color 4) has incorrectly expanded into the position of the removed Object_8, which should not happen as the spaces filled should be in the same row. Therefore, Object_7 should only expand into the space left by Object_8 if it was in the same row, which it is not. The correct output for Object_7 should be [{'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}]. Object_2 and Object_3 (color 7) should merge into Object_1 to form a continuous object in the top row, which is done correctly in the test output. The test output correctly handles Object_5 by not moving or expanding it as it's already in the leftmost column.",
