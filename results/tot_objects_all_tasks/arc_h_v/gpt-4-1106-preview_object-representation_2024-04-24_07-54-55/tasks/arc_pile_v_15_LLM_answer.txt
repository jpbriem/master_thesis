You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

overall pattern: For each color, merge all objects in the same column, place them in the bottom-most empty row of that column, and increase their size to fill the column from their new position downward


transformation steps:
create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the same column.', 'For each group of objects that share the same color and column, determine the bottom-most empty row in that column.', 'Merge these objects into a single object located at the bottom-most empty row.', 'Extend the size of the merged object to fill the column from its new position downward.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color combine into a single object, which is placed in the bottommost row that the original objects occupied, with the size equal to the combined size of all the objects of that color
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, move the combined object to the bottommost row where any part of it was located, and adjust the size to the total size of the combined objects



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid and group them by color.', 'For each color group, calculate the total size (sum of sizes of all objects of that color).', 'Find the bottom-most row that contains any part of the objects for each color group.', 'Place the new combined object of each color group in the identified bottom-most row. The leftmost position of the combined object should be the leftmost column where any part of the original objects of that color was located.', 'The size of the new combined object should match the total size of that color group.', 'All other non-combined objects or objects that are only single instances remain in the same column and are moved down to the bottom-most row.']

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects merge and move if they share the same color and column coordinates; the size and final position depend on the number of empty rows beneath them in the same column
overall pattern: For each color, merge all objects in the same column, place them in the bottom-most empty row of that column, and increase their size to fill the column from their new position downward

transformation steps:
create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the same column.', 'For each group of objects that share the same color and column, determine the bottom-most empty row in that column.', 'Merge these objects into a single object located at the bottom-most empty row.', 'Extend the size of the merged object to fill the column from its new position downward.']



Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color combine into a single object, which is placed in the bottommost row that the original objects occupied, with the size equal to the combined size of all the objects of that color
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, move the combined object to the bottommost row where any part of it was located, and adjust the size to the total size of the combined objects


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid and group them by color.', 'For each color group, calculate the total size (sum of sizes of all objects of that color).', 'Find the bottom-most row that contains any part of the objects for each color group.', 'Place the new combined object of each color group in the identified bottom-most row. The leftmost position of the combined object should be the leftmost column where any part of the original objects of that color was located.', 'The size of the new combined object should match the total size of that color group.', 'All other non-combined objects or objects that are only single instances remain in the same column and are moved down to the bottom-most row.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects merge and move if they share the same color and column coordinates; the size and final position depend on the number of empty rows beneath them in the same column
overall pattern: For each color, merge all objects in the same column, place them in the bottom-most empty row of that column, and increase their size to fill the column from their new position downward

transformation steps:
create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the same column.', 'For each group of objects that share the same color and column, determine the bottom-most empty row in that column.', 'Merge these objects into a single object located at the bottom-most empty row.', 'Extend the size of the merged object to fill the column from its new position downward.']



Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:

The test output grid correctly transformed Object_1, Object_2, and Object_3 according to the transformation steps and overall pattern. However, Object_4 was incorrectly transformed as it should occupy the bottom three rows of the fourth column, but it is shown only in the second to fourth rows. Object_5 and Object_7 were correctly merged and transformed into a single object filling the bottom three rows of the fifth column.

For Object_4, the transformation is incorrect because it includes an additional pixel at [2,3] which is not part of the original object configuration, and it should only have expanded the original object at [4,3] to include [3,3], resulting in a size of 2. Lastly, Object_5's transformation incorrectly merges two separate objects into one. According to the pattern, each original object should independently move to the bottom of their column and expand, resulting in two separate objects of size 2 and 1, respectively, not a single object of size 3. Therefore, the test output is not entirely consistent with the stated rules.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

For the objects with color 7, the test output incorrectly shows a merged object starting at row 2 instead of row 4, which would be the bottom-most empty row for that column. Additionally, the two objects with color 2 should merge into a single object at the bottom-most empty row, which is row 4, and extend to row 3, but the test output shows them starting at row 3 and extending to row 4.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color combine into a single object, which is placed in the bottommost row that the original objects occupied, with the size equal to the combined size of all the objects of that color
overall pattern: For each color, combine all objects of that color into one, move the combined object to the bottommost row where any part of it was located, and adjust the size to the total size of the combined objects


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid and group them by color.', 'For each color group, calculate the total size (sum of sizes of all objects of that color).', 'Find the bottom-most row that contains any part of the objects for each color group.', 'Place the new combined object of each color group in the identified bottom-most row. The leftmost position of the combined object should be the leftmost column where any part of the original objects of that color was located.', 'The size of the new combined object should match the total size of that color group.', 'All other non-combined objects or objects that are only single instances remain in the same column and are moved down to the bottom-most row.']
