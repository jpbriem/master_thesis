You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that share the same color combine into one larger object and move to the lowest available spaces within their initial columns. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the combined objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color within individual columns, combine them into a single object, calculate the new size, and move the resulting object to the bottom of the column. Objects that do not have a matching color within the column simply move to the bottom of the column.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within individual columns.', 'Combine objects of the same color into one larger object, summing their sizes.', "Move the resulting object to the bottom of the column it's in, filling in the lowest available spaces.", 'Objects with unique colors within their column are simply moved to the bottom of their column, without combining.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the bottom of the grid and merge with other objects of the same color in the same column
overall pattern: when transforming any input into its output, each object moves vertically down to the lowest available space within its column. If multiple objects of the same color exist in a column, they combine into a single object at the bottom of that column


transformation steps: ["Identify each object's column and its bottommost empty space within that column.", 'Move each object down the column to the identified bottommost empty space.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are present in the same column, merge them into a single object at the bottom of that column.', "The merged object's size is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects that were merged.", "The merged object's coordinates are a contiguous vertical sequence of spaces starting from the bottom of the column."]


Test case:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that share the same color combine into one larger object and move to the lowest available spaces within their initial columns. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the combined objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color within individual columns, combine them into a single object, calculate the new size, and move the resulting object to the bottom of the column. Objects that do not have a matching color within the column simply move to the bottom of the column.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within individual columns.', 'Combine objects of the same color into one larger object, summing their sizes.', "Move the resulting object to the bottom of the column it's in, filling in the lowest available spaces.", 'Objects with unique colors within their column are simply moved to the bottom of their column, without combining.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the bottom of the grid and merge with other objects of the same color in the same column
overall pattern: when transforming any input into its output, each object moves vertically down to the lowest available space within its column. If multiple objects of the same color exist in a column, they combine into a single object at the bottom of that column


transformation steps: ["Identify each object's column and its bottommost empty space within that column.", 'Move each object down the column to the identified bottommost empty space.', 'If multiple objects of the same color are present in the same column, merge them into a single object at the bottom of that column.', "The merged object's size is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects that were merged.", "The merged object's coordinates are a contiguous vertical sequence of spaces starting from the bottom of the column."]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that share the same color combine into one larger object and move to the lowest available spaces within their initial columns. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the combined objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color within individual columns, combine them into a single object, calculate the new size, and move the resulting object to the bottom of the column. Objects that do not have a matching color within the column simply move to the bottom of the column.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color within individual columns.', 'Combine objects of the same color into one larger object, summing their sizes.', "Move the resulting object to the bottom of the column it's in, filling in the lowest available spaces.", 'Objects with unique colors within their column are simply moved to the bottom of their column, without combining.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [4, 4]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

The issue arises with the coordinates of Object_2, which should be [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]] instead of [[2, 1], [3, 1]] because Object_2 should occupy three spaces starting from the second row from the bottom, not the third, due to its size of 3.
