You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position in their row. Objects can expand by one pixel to the left if there's space in the leftmost position. Objects that are alone in their row are removed. If objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object with expansion towards the left.
overall pattern: For any input, move objects to the leftmost position in their row. Expand objects by one pixel towards the left if possible. Remove any objects that are alone in their row. Merge objects of the same color in the same row with expansion towards the left.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [4, 5]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved to the leftmost column of their original row. Objects of the same color in the same row are combined into a single object, starting from the leftmost column. This may result in objects increasing in size or being absorbed by other objects.
overall pattern: For any input, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If objects in the same row have the same color, they are combined into a single object starting from the leftmost column.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the same row.', 'Check for objects with the same color in the same row.', 'Move each object to the leftmost available position within its row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, combine them starting from the leftmost position of the first object in the row.', 'The combined object extends to the right, taking up additional columns as needed based on the total size of the merged objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved to the leftmost column of their original row. Objects of the same color in the same row are combined into a single object, starting from the leftmost column. This may result in objects increasing in size or being absorbed by other objects.
overall pattern: For any input, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If objects in the same row have the same color, they are combined into a single object starting from the leftmost column.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the same row.', 'Check for objects with the same color in the same row.', 'Move each object to the leftmost available position within its row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, combine them starting from the leftmost position of the first object in the row.', 'The combined object extends to the right, taking up additional columns as needed based on the total size of the merged objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [4, 5]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved to the leftmost column of their original row. Objects of the same color in the same row are combined into a single object, starting from the leftmost column. This may result in objects increasing in size or being absorbed by other objects.
overall pattern: For any input, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If objects in the same row have the same color, they are combined into a single object starting from the leftmost column.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the same row.', 'Check for objects with the same color in the same row.', 'Move each object to the leftmost available position within its row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, combine them starting from the leftmost position of the first object in the row.', 'The combined object extends to the right, taking up additional columns as needed based on the total size of the merged objects.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_5': {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}}, {'Object_7': {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}}]

The labels in the output do not match the input object labels, which could cause confusion. For example, 'Object_3' and 'Object_6' from the input are not explicitly referenced in the output, even though their transformations are accounted for in 'Object_2' and 'Object_5'. 'Object_8' from the input is missing, which seems to be an error as it should have been combined with 'Object_7' to extend the size of that object. Therefore, the output is not completely accurate.",

According to the transformation steps, Object_8 should have been moved to the left of the row and combined with Object_7, resulting in a single object with color 5 that occupies the first three spaces of the fifth row. The output has correctly combined these objects, but the size is listed as 3 instead of the correct size of 4, as there are two parts of Object_7 and one part of Object_8 that should have been combined after the move.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Single pixel objects move to the leftmost position within their row, objects that are the only ones of their color in the row remain unchanged, larger objects remain in place, single pixels are absorbed if there is another object of the same color in the same row, objects of the same color merge and move to the left
overall pattern: Move all objects to the leftmost position within their row, merge objects of the same color into larger objects if they are on the same row, remove single pixels if they are absorbed into a larger object of the same color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects and their colors within each row.', 'For single pixel objects, if they are the only ones of their color in a row, move them to the leftmost position within that row.', 'For objects that are larger than a single pixel and are the only ones of their color in a row, leave them in place.', 'For single pixel objects, if there is another object of the same color in the same row, absorb the single pixel into the larger object.', 'For objects of the same color on the same row, merge them into a larger object and move this new object to the leftmost position within that row.', 'Remove any single pixels that have been absorbed into larger objects.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_5': {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}}, {'Object_7': {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}}]
