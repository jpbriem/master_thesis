The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation

This rule applies to each object based on its row, maintaining the original order of objects from top to bottom.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions given refer to the input and are relevant to determine the changes, as they dictate the movement and expansion of objects based on their color and position.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output, but there are ambiguities in the description of how subsequent objects of the same color should be handled and how to determine the order when multiple objects of the same color are present in different rows.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is not precise enough for a new input to its output without further clarification on the rules for subsequent objects of the same color and handling of the last object in the input.\",\n    \"value\": 6\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are consistent with the changes observed in the example, indicating the leftward movement and the horizontal expansion of objects.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The pattern accurately describes the input to output transformation, including the movement to the left and the horizontal expansion based on the first appearance and the last object rule.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is precise enough to apply the transformation to a new input, although it could be improved by specifying the exact behavior when multiple objects of the same color appear in different rows.\",\n    \"value\": 7\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions match the observed transformations, including the leftward shift and horizontal expansion of objects.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation process, but it is not clear how the objects' original order impacts the transformation or how to handle the expansion when dealing with multiple objects of the same color.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"While the pattern is somewhat precise, additional details on the handling of objects of the same color appearing in different rows and their order would be helpful for transforming a new input.\",\n    \"value\": 6\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions are relevant as they provide a clear rule for how objects should be moved and possibly expanded in the grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation accurately for Example_1, as all objects have been moved to the left and resized according to the specified rules.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough for a new input to be transformed into its output if the new input follows the same rules as the examples.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions apply to Example_2, correctly predicting the movement of objects to the leftmost side of the grid.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the output of Example_2, with each object moving to the left and the first object of each color expanding to cover the specified number of columns.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern provides enough detail to replicate the transformation for a new input, assuming it adheres to the same constraints outlined in the examples.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are applied correctly in Example_3, which indicates that the pattern holds for this example as well.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The pattern is consistent with the transformation seen in Example_3.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [3, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects move to the leftmost side of the grid starting at column 0. The first object of each color expands to fill additional columns to the right, maintaining or increasing its original size. Subsequent objects of the same color maintain their size but shift left. The last object in the input expands to fill all remaining columns from the left, up to three columns if it started as a single pixel.\noverall pattern: For each row, starting from the topmost, move objects to the leftmost available position. Expand objects horizontally to occupy additional columns as follows: if it's the first appearance of a color in the input, ensure it covers at least two columns (or three if it's the last object in the input). If the same color appears again in the input, maintain its original size but ensure it starts from the leftmost available position. This rule applies to each object based on its row, maintaining the original order of objects from top to bottom.\n\n\ntransformation steps:\nstep 1: Identify objects by color and their positions in the grid.\nstep 2: Move each object to the leftmost available position in its respective row.\nstep 3: For the first appearance of each color, ensure the object covers at least two columns. If it is already larger, no expansion is required.\nstep 4: For subsequent appearances of the same color within the grid, maintain their original size but align them to the leftmost available position.\nstep 5: For the last object in the input, if it is a single pixel, expand it to fill up to three columns starting from the left.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

The first object of each color expands to fill additional columns to the right, maintaining or increasing its original size. Subsequent objects of the same color maintain their size but shift left. The last object in the input expands to fill all remaining columns from the left, up to three columns if it started as a single pixel.\noverall pattern: For each row, starting from the topmost, move objects to the leftmost available position. Expand objects horizontally to occupy additional columns as follows: if it's the first appearance of a color in the input, ensure it covers at least two columns (or three if it's the last object in the input). If the same color appears again in the input, maintain its original size but ensure it starts from the leftmost available position. This rule applies to each object based on its row, maintaining the original order of objects from top to bottom.\n\ntransformation steps:\nstep 1: Identify objects by color and their positions in the grid.\nstep 2: Move each object to the leftmost available position in its respective row.\nstep 3: For the first appearance of each color, ensure the object covers at least two columns. If it is already larger, no expansion is required.\nstep 4: For subsequent appearances of the same color within the grid, maintain their original size but align them to the leftmost available position.\nstep 5: For the last object in the input, if it is a single pixel, expand it to fill up to three columns starting from the left.\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 3], [5, 4], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_case_input_objects\": [\n    {\n      \"Object_1\": {\n        \"color\": 8,\n        \"coordinates\": [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5]],\n        \"size\": 3\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_2\": {\n        \"color\": 7,\n        \"coordinates\": [[1, 3], [1, 4]],\n        \"size\": 2\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_3\": {\n        \"color\": 3,\n        \"coordinates\": [[2, 3]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_4\": {\n        \"color\": 3,\n        \"coordinates\": [[2, 5]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_5\": {\n        \"color\": 5,\n        \"coordinates\": [[3, 0]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_6\": {\n        \"color\": 6,\n        \"coordinates\": [[4, 0]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_7\": {\n        \"color\": 4,\n        \"coordinates\": [[5, 3], [5, 4], [5, 5]],\n        \"size\": 3\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"transformation\": \"Object_1, being the first and only appearance of color 8, should expand to fill at least two columns, thus occupying coordinates [[0, 0], [0, 1]].
