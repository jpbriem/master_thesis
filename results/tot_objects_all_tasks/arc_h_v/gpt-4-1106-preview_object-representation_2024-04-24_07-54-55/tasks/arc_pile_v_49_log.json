The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects move downwards to fill space if possible. Objects of the same color merge and grow in size when aligned vertically or horizontally. Objects that are isolated and not the largest of their color are removed.\noverall pattern: For each color, move the largest object down to fill space, merge with other objects of the same color if aligned, and increase its size accordingly. Remove smaller, separate objects of the same color.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input grid and their properties, including color, coordinates, and size.', 'For each color, determine the largest object.', 'Move the largest object of each color down to the bottom of the grid to fill space, preserving its horizontal position.', 'If there are other objects of the same color, merge them with the largest object if they are aligned vertically or horizontally, and increase the size of the largest object accordingly.', 'Remove all smaller, separate objects of the same color that are not merged with the largest object.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
