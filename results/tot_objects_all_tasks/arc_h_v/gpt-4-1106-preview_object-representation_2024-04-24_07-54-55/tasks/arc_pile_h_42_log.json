The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 1], [5, 2], [5, 3]], 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [3, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}\n\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"decreased from 7 to 6\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"Object_2 and Object_3 merged into a single object with size increased from 1 to 2 and moved to the left edge starting at [1,0].

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

First, according to the steps, objects of the same color should merge and then be placed in the leftmost column of the grid starting at the row of the uppermost pixel of the original objects. In the test output, Object_1 (color 1) is correctly merged and moved to the coordinates [[0, 0], [1, 0]], but Object_2 (color 9) is incorrectly identified in the output. It should be a single object starting at the uppermost pixel's row, which is row 1, and should occupy two consecutive rows from this point downwards, as it was a size of 2. Therefore, the correct coordinates for Object_2 should be [[1, 0], [2, 0]]. However, the output incorrectly places Object_2 starting from row 1 and row 2, overlapping the correct position of Object_1, which is an error. Furthermore, Object_3 (color 3) and Object_4 (color 7) are correctly placed in the output.
