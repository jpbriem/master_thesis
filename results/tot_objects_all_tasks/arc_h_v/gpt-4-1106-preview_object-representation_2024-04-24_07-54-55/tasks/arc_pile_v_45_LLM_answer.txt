You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects shift towards the bottom-right corner of the grid based on their initial position. Objects on the top half move to the bottom half, and objects on the left half move to the right half. If multiple objects of the same color exist, they merge into one at the bottom-rightmost position among them, and the size of the resulting object is the sum of the individual sizes minus the number of objects that merged (as one unit is double-counted for each object after the first)
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1) Identify objects' halves (top/bottom and left/right), 2) Move objects from the top half to the bottom half and from the left half to the right half, 3) Merge objects of the same color into one and adjust the size accordingly. The resulting object will be located at the bottom-rightmost position of the merged objects

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge into a single object at the bottom of the same column, their size is the sum of their individual sizes before merging
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, merge objects of the same color into a single object at the bottom of the column where they are located. The merged object's size should be the sum of the sizes of all objects of that color. If there are multiple objects of the same color in different columns, each column's objects merge separately.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge into a single object at the bottom of the same column, their size is the sum of their individual sizes before merging
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, merge objects of the same color into a single object at the bottom of the column where they are located. The merged object's size should be the sum of the sizes of all objects of that color. If there are multiple objects of the same color in different columns, each column's objects merge separately.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color in the input grid.', 'For each color, compute the sum of sizes of all objects of that color.', "For each column that contains objects of the same color, merge these objects at the bottom of the column. The merged object's size is the sum of the sizes of all objects of that color in that column.", "The merged object's color remains the same as the original objects' color.", 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in different columns, merge them separately within their respective columns.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

conditions: Objects move to the furthest edge in their row or column. Objects of the same color combine into one object. Objects that are alone at their row or column level disappear, unless they are already at the furthest edge.

Remove objects that are alone at their level unless they are at the furthest edge.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid, grouped by color and position.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, combine their sizes and move them to the furthest edge of their row or column.', 'If an object is alone at its row or column level and not already at the furthest edge, remove it from the grid.', 'If an object is alone but already at the furthest edge, it remains unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge into a single object at the bottom of the same column, their size is the sum of their individual sizes before merging
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, merge objects of the same color into a single object at the bottom of the column where they are located. The merged object's size should be the sum of the sizes of all objects of that color. If there are multiple objects of the same color in different columns, each column's objects merge separately.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color in the input grid.', 'For each color, compute the sum of sizes of all objects of that color.', "For each column that contains objects of the same color, merge these objects at the bottom of the column. The merged object's size is the sum of the sizes of all objects of that color in that column.", "The merged object's color remains the same as the original objects' color.", 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in different columns, merge them separately within their respective columns.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 4], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the furthest edge in their row or column. Objects of the same color combine into one object. Objects that are alone at their row or column level disappear, unless they are already at the furthest edge.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Identify objects on the same row or column. 2. Combine objects of the same color, increase their size, and move them to the furthest edge of their row or column. 3. Remove objects that are alone at their level unless they are at the furthest edge.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid, grouped by color and position.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, combine their sizes and move them to the furthest edge of their row or column.', 'If an object is alone at its row or column level and not already at the furthest edge, remove it from the grid.', 'If an object is alone but already at the furthest edge, it remains unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [3, 4]], 'size': 2}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
