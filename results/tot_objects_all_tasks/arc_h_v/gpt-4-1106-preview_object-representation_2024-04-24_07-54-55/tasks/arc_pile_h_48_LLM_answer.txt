You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: When objects share the same color and are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies the leftmost positions of that row. Objects of different colors move to the leftmost position of their original row without merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row, merge any adjacent objects of the same color into one and move them to the left side of the grid, filling the row from the left. If objects of different colors are in the same row, do not merge but move them to the leftmost available space in their respective rows.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: When objects share the same color and are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies the leftmost positions of that row. Objects of different colors move to the leftmost position of their original row without merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row, merge any adjacent objects of the same color into one and move them to the left side of the grid, filling the row from the left. If objects of different colors are in the same row, do not merge but move them to the leftmost available space in their respective rows.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

overall pattern:
conditions: When objects share the same color and are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies the leftmost positions of that row. Objects of different colors move to the leftmost position of their original row without merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row, merge any adjacent objects of the same color into one and move them to the left side of the grid, filling the row from the left. If objects of different colors are in the same row, do not merge but move them to the leftmost available space in their respective rows.



transformation steps: ['For each row in the grid:', '1. Identify objects of the same color that are adjacent and in the same row.', '2. Merge these objects into one, which will occupy the leftmost positions in that row. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the merged objects.', '3. For objects of different colors that are in the same row, move them towards the left side of the row, placing them in the leftmost available spaces without merging them.', '4. Ensure the rest of the row is filled with the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: When objects share the same color and are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies the leftmost positions of that row. Objects of different colors move to the leftmost position of their original row without merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row, merge any adjacent objects of the same color into one and move them to the left side of the grid, filling the row from the left. If objects of different colors are in the same row, do not merge but move them to the leftmost available space in their respective rows.


transformation steps: ['For each row in the grid:', '1. Identify objects of the same color that are adjacent and in the same row.', '2. Merge these objects into one, which will occupy the leftmost positions in that row. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the merged objects.', '3. For objects of different colors that are in the same row, move them towards the left side of the row, placing them in the leftmost available spaces without merging them.', '4. Ensure the rest of the row is filled with the background color (0).']

#############################Sample Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are alone of their color in a row disappear, objects with the same color in a row combine and expand or contract to fill from the leftmost position of the first object to the rightmost position of the last object in that row
overall pattern: For each row, remove isolated objects of a single color. For objects with the same color in the same row, merge them into a single object that spans from the leftmost position of the first object to the rightmost position of the last object in that row, adjusting the size and coordinates accordingly


transformation steps: ['Identify rows with multiple objects of the same color.', 'For each identified row, determine the leftmost and rightmost coordinates of the objects with the same color.', 'Remove objects that are the only one of their color in their row.', 'Combine objects with the same color in the same row into a single object spanning from the leftmost to the rightmost position.', 'Update the size and coordinates of the new combined object to reflect the transformation.', 'Move any single objects to the leftmost position in their respective rows if they are alone of their color.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: When objects share the same color and are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies the leftmost positions of that row. Objects of different colors move to the leftmost position of their original row without merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row, merge any adjacent objects of the same color into one and move them to the left side of the grid, filling the row from the left. If objects of different colors are in the same row, do not merge but move them to the leftmost available space in their respective rows.


transformation steps: ['For each row in the grid:', '1. Identify objects of the same color that are adjacent and in the same row.', '2. Merge these objects into one, which will occupy the leftmost positions in that row. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the merged objects.', '3. For objects of different colors that are in the same row, move them towards the left side of the row, placing them in the leftmost available spaces without merging them.', '4. Ensure the rest of the row is filled with the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}]

overall pattern:
conditions: When objects share the same color and are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies the leftmost positions of that row. Objects of different colors move to the leftmost position of their original row without merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each row, merge any adjacent objects of the same color into one and move them to the left side of the grid, filling the row from the left. If objects of different colors are in the same row, do not merge but move them to the leftmost available space in their respective rows.


transformation steps: ['For each row in the grid:', '1. Identify objects of the same color that are adjacent and in the same row.', '2. Merge these objects into one, which will occupy the leftmost positions in that row. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the merged objects.', '3. For objects of different colors that are in the same row, move them towards the left side of the row, placing them in the leftmost available spaces without merging them.', '4. Ensure the rest of the row is filled with the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are alone of their color in a row disappear, objects with the same color in a row combine and expand or contract to fill from the leftmost position of the first object to the rightmost position of the last object in that row
overall pattern: For each row, remove isolated objects of a single color. For objects with the same color in the same row, merge them into a single object that spans from the leftmost position of the first object to the rightmost position of the last object in that row, adjusting the size and coordinates accordingly


transformation steps: ['Identify rows with multiple objects of the same color.', 'For each identified row, determine the leftmost and rightmost coordinates of the objects with the same color.', 'Remove objects that are the only one of their color in their row.', 'Combine objects with the same color in the same row into a single object spanning from the leftmost to the rightmost position.', 'Update the size and coordinates of the new combined object to reflect the transformation.', 'Move any single objects to the leftmost position in their respective rows if they are alone of their color.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]], 'size': 3}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps seem to have been applied mostly correctly to the test input grid. The merging and relocating operations are consistent with the described overall pattern, with a couple of exceptions. Object_1 (color 7) has been removed as it was the only object of its color in the row, which is correct. Objects with color 9 in row 1 were correctly combined into a single object and expanded to fill the row from the leftmost to the rightmost position of the original objects. Additionally, the single object with color 1 in row 2 has been moved to the leftmost position of that row, which follows the given rules. The same applies to the single objects with colors 5 in row 3 and 8 in row 4, which have been correctly retained and expanded. However, there is a mistake in the output: the color 9 object should begin at the leftmost position of the original first object (coordinate [1, 2]), but in the test output, it incorrectly starts at [1, 2] instead of [1, 0]. Similarly, the color 8 object in the last row should start at [4, 0] instead of [4, 2]. These errors indicate that the leftward movement step for single objects in their rows has not been correctly applied to the combined objects.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid has some issues when compared to the transformation steps. To begin with, Object_1 with color 7 from the input is missing in the output. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, isolated objects of a single color in a row should disappear; however, color 7's object is not isolated since it occupies two adjacent positions in the same row and should thus have been transformed to span the entire row from the leftmost to the rightmost position. Next, for color 9, the objects in row 1 have been correctly merged to span from the leftmost to the rightmost position as per the transformation pattern. For Object_4 with color 1, it has been correctly moved to the leftmost position in its row since it's the only object of its color in that row. The objects with color 5 have been left unchanged, which is correct as they are adjacent and span their original positions. However, the objects with color 8 have been incorrectly merged, as the overall pattern specifies that objects only combine if they are in the same row. Since the two objects of color 8 are on different rows, they should not have been combined. Therefore, the transformation steps have not been applied correctly to the test input grid.",
