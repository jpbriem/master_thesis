You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:

overall pattern: single objects move to the rightmost position on the same row, objects of the same color on the same row merge and size increases accordingly, merged objects or single objects move to the bottommost available position in the column they end up in after the first step, maintaining their left to right order from the original positions

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects shift towards the bottom of the grid, maintaining their color; objects of the same color merge and increase in size to occupy available vertical space below them; objects that do not merge maintain their size but shift to the lowest available space in their column
overall pattern: For any input, move all objects towards the bottom of the grid while preserving their color. If objects of the same color align vertically, merge them into one object, which spans the vertical space from the topmost to the bottommost original object of that color. Objects that cannot merge maintain their size but shift to the lowest position in their column.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects and their colors in the input grid.', 'For each column, check if there are multiple objects of the same color that can merge vertically.', 'If objects of the same color can merge, create a new object that spans from the topmost to the bottommost original object of that color, occupying all vertical space between them.', 'For objects that do not merge, shift them down to the lowest available space in their respective columns.', 'Maintain the original colors of all objects during their transformation.', 'Fill with background color (0) any space that is no longer occupied by an object.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects shift towards the bottom of the grid, maintaining their color; objects of the same color merge and increase in size to occupy available vertical space below them; objects that do not merge maintain their size but shift to the lowest available space in their column
overall pattern: For any input, move all objects towards the bottom of the grid while preserving their color. If objects of the same color align vertically, merge them into one object, which spans the vertical space from the topmost to the bottommost original object of that color. Objects that cannot merge maintain their size but shift to the lowest position in their column.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects and their colors in the input grid.', 'For each column, check if there are multiple objects of the same color that can merge vertically.', 'If objects of the same color can merge, create a new object that spans from the topmost to the bottommost original object of that color, occupying all vertical space between them.', 'For objects that do not merge, shift them down to the lowest available space in their respective columns.', 'Maintain the original colors of all objects during their transformation.', 'Fill with background color (0) any space that is no longer occupied by an object.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Single objects move to the bottom of their column. Objects of the same color that are in the same row merge into a single object and move to the bottom of their column
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the bottom of their column. If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into one object extending from the leftmost object's column to the rightmost object's column and then move the merged object to the bottom of the grid


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by color and coordinates.', 'For each column, determine the objects present and calculate their bottom-most position within the column.', 'For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into a single object by combining their coordinates and extending from the leftmost to the rightmost object within the row.', 'Move each object or merged object to the bottom-most position of their respective columns while maintaining their horizontal span if merged.', "Update the grid to reflect the transformed positions of all objects, ensuring that the object's color and shape remain consistent with the merging rules."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects shift towards the bottom of the grid, maintaining their color; objects of the same color merge and increase in size to occupy available vertical space below them; objects that do not merge maintain their size but shift to the lowest available space in their column
overall pattern: For any input, move all objects towards the bottom of the grid while preserving their color. If objects of the same color align vertically, merge them into one object, which spans the vertical space from the topmost to the bottommost original object of that color. Objects that cannot merge maintain their size but shift to the lowest position in their column.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects and their colors in the input grid.', 'For each column, check if there are multiple objects of the same color that can merge vertically.', 'If objects of the same color can merge, create a new object that spans from the topmost to the bottommost original object of that color, occupying all vertical space between them.', 'For objects that do not merge, shift them down to the lowest available space in their respective columns.', 'Maintain the original colors of all objects during their transformation.', 'Fill with background color (0) any space that is no longer occupied by an object.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
