You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

conditions: Objects of unique colors in the input grid expand or move horizontally by one space. Objects of the same color connect if they are in the same row. Any objects that become connected are treated as a single object after the transformation. Object colors determine the direction of expansion or movement: color 2 expands to the right, color 8 and color 1 expand to the left, color 4 remains stationary, and color 7 remains unchanged. If an object moves or expands to occupy the leftmost column, it retains its size but changes its position.
overall pattern: For each object, if it is the only object of its color in its row, it expands or moves horizontally by one space according to its color rule. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they connect to form a larger object that spans the distance between them. Objects that do not meet these conditions are removed. The output grid is the result of applying these transformations to each object in the input grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand horizontally to the left to fill the row from their leftmost pixel, and all other objects of the same color disappear
overall pattern: For each color in the input, find the leftmost object, expand it to fill the entire row to its left, and remove all other objects of the same color



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the grid.', 'For each color, find the object with the leftmost starting point (smallest column index).', 'Expand this object horizontally to fill the entire row to the left, starting from its leftmost pixel.', 'Remove all other objects of the same color from the grid.', 'Repeat the process for each color present in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects merge and/or expand only if they share the same color and are located on the same row. Merging objects combine into one, expanding horizontally towards the leftmost empty space in their row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, merge objects of the same color that are on the same row into a single object and expand their size horizontally to occupy the leftmost empty spaces in their row.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects that share the same color and are located on the same row.', 'Combine these objects into one larger object.', 'Extend the size of the new object horizontally to fill the leftmost available spaces in its row.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

#############################Sample Prompt:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [3, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand horizontally to the left to fill the row from their leftmost pixel, and all other objects of the same color disappear
overall pattern: For each color in the input, find the leftmost object, expand it to fill the entire row to its left, and remove all other objects of the same color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the grid.', 'For each color, find the object with the leftmost starting point (smallest column index).', 'Expand this object horizontally to fill the entire row to the left, starting from its leftmost pixel.', 'Remove all other objects of the same color from the grid.', 'Repeat the process for each color present in the grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
