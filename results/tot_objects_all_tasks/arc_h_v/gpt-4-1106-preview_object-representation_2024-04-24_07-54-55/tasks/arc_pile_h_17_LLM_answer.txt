You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost available position in their respective rows; if multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object starting from column 0
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects to the leftmost position in their row. For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into one object starting from column 0. The size of the merged object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects that do not merge maintain their original size

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

If an object is alone in its row or does not merge, and its size is less than 3, expand the object to the right to make it 3 pixels wide. Ignore objects that are already 3 pixels wide or larger.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color on the same row either merge or expand to occupy continuous leftmost positions in their row, single-pixel objects move to the leftmost position of their row, objects that are not in a straight line contract to occupy the leftmost positions in their row
overall pattern: For objects of the same color in a straight line on the same row: if there is more than one object, they merge and expand to fill from the leftmost position up to the sum of their sizes; if there is only one object, it moves to the leftmost position. For objects not in a straight line, they contract to occupy the leftmost positions in their row

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position in their respective rows. Objects of the same color in the same row merge and expand to the right to fill cells equal to the sum of their sizes. Objects with a size of 1 or 2 expand to the right to become 3 pixels wide unless they merge with other objects.
overall pattern: Move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, merge them into one object, starting from the leftmost position and expand to the right to fill as many cells as the sum of the sizes of the merged objects. If an object is alone in its row or does not merge, and its size is less than 3, expand the object to the right to make it 3 pixels wide. Ignore objects that are already 3 pixels wide or larger.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost available position in their respective rows; if multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object starting from column 0
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects to the leftmost position in their row. For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into one object starting from column 0. The size of the merged object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects that do not merge maintain their original size



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid based on color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects present in that row.', 'Move all objects to the leftmost available position in their respective rows.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into a single object.', 'The starting column for the merged object is column 0.', 'The size of the merged object is equal to the sum of the sizes of all objects being merged.', 'If an object does not merge with others, it maintains its original size and only shifts to the leftmost position.', 'Repeat the process for all rows in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost available position in their respective rows; if multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object starting from column 0
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects to the leftmost position in their row. For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into one object starting from column 0. The size of the merged object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects that do not merge maintain their original size


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid based on color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects present in that row.', 'Move all objects to the leftmost available position in their respective rows.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into a single object.', 'The starting column for the merged object is column 0.', 'The size of the merged object is equal to the sum of the sizes of all objects being merged.', 'If an object does not merge with others, it maintains its original size and only shifts to the leftmost position.', 'Repeat the process for all rows in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position in their respective rows. Objects of the same color in the same row merge and expand to the right to fill cells equal to the sum of their sizes. Objects with a size of 1 or 2 expand to the right to become 3 pixels wide unless they merge with other objects.
overall pattern: Move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, merge them into one object, starting from the leftmost position and expand to the right to fill as many cells as the sum of the sizes of the merged objects. If an object is alone in its row or does not merge, and its size is less than 3, expand the object to the right to make it 3 pixels wide. Ignore objects that are already 3 pixels wide or larger.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in each row.', 'Move objects to the leftmost available position in their respective rows.', 'If objects of the same color exist in the same row, merge them at the leftmost position.', 'Calculate the new size of merged objects by summing the sizes of individual merged objects.', 'Expand objects to the right to occupy a number of cells equal to their size after merging, or to a minimum width of 3 pixels if they are not merged and their size is less than 3.', 'Maintain the original color of the objects during the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost available position in their respective rows; if multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object starting from column 0
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects to the leftmost position in their row. For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into one object starting from column 0. The size of the merged object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects that do not merge maintain their original size


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid based on color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects present in that row.', 'Move all objects to the leftmost available position in their respective rows.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, merge them into a single object.', 'The starting column for the merged object is column 0.', 'The size of the merged object is equal to the sum of the sizes of all objects being merged.', 'If an object does not merge with others, it maintains its original size and only shifts to the leftmost position.', 'Repeat the process for all rows in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

Object_2, which is color 1 and occupies the entire row 1 from [1, 1] to [1, 3], remains in row 1 starting from the leftmost position with the same size, resulting in the coordinates [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]]. Object_3 and Object_4 are both color 5 in row 2 and have been correctly merged into one object starting from the leftmost position. Since the total size of the merged objects is 3, the object occupies [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]. Object_5, which is color 2 and originally at [3, 3], has been moved to the leftmost position of row 3 and expanded to the right to become 3 pixels wide, resulting in the coordinates [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]] and a size of 3. However, there is a discrepancy in the naming convention of the transformed objects in the JSON output.

Object_3 and Object_4 (both color 5) were correctly merged into a single object of size 3, following the rule for merging objects of the same color in the same row. However, a critical error occurred with Object_5 (color 2), which was supposed to move to the leftmost position in row 3 and then expand to be 3 pixels wide. But in the output, Object_4 is missing in the transformed objects list, and it seems to have been mistakenly labeled as 'Object_5'.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color.
