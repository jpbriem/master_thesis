You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position within their row. If two objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge and expand to fill from the leftmost position in the row. Objects that do not have similar colors in the same row are unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost position, with the size equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row. Objects that are the only one of their color in their row or have no matching color objects in the same row remain unchanged.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position of their row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they merge into one object starting from the leftmost position and grow to the right. An object grows in size to the right until it reaches a size of at least 3 or meets the end of the grid or another object. Objects that are not leftmost in their row and have the same color disappear.
overall pattern: Move all objects to the leftmost position in their respective rows. Merge any objects of the same color that are in the same row and grow them to the right until reaching a size of 3, unless they encounter the grid's edge or another object. Remove any objects that are not the leftmost of their color in the row.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position within their row. If two objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge and expand to fill from the leftmost position in the row. Objects that do not have similar colors in the same row are unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost position, with the size equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row. Objects that are the only one of their color in their row or have no matching color objects in the same row remain unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors present in the grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects of the same color.', 'If an object is the only one of its color in its row, move it to the leftmost position within that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object at the leftmost position of the row.', 'The size of the merged object should be equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row.', 'Remove any excess objects after merging, as they are now part of the merged object.', 'Repeat this process for each row in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [3, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position within their row. If two objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge and expand to fill from the leftmost position in the row. Objects that do not have similar colors in the same row are unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost position, with the size equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row. Objects that are the only one of their color in their row or have no matching color objects in the same row remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors present in the grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects of the same color.', 'If an object is the only one of its color in its row, move it to the leftmost position within that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object at the leftmost position of the row.', 'The size of the merged object should be equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row.', 'Remove any excess objects after merging, as they are now part of the merged object.', 'Repeat this process for each row in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [3, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the start of their row; objects expand to the size of the largest object in the same row if they have the same color; objects disappear if they are not the largest of their color in the same row
overall pattern: Objects are shifted to the start of their row; for objects of the same color within a row, only the largest object remains and expands to fill the row from the start to its size; smaller objects of the same color in the row disappear


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and size.', 'Move all objects to the start of their respective rows.', 'Within each row, compare the sizes of objects that share the same color.', 'For objects of the same color, only retain the largest object.', 'Expand the retained object to fill its row starting from the beginning of the row up to its size.', 'Remove any smaller objects of the same color within the same row.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position within their row. If two objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge and expand to fill from the leftmost position in the row. Objects that do not have similar colors in the same row are unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost position, with the size equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row. Objects that are the only one of their color in their row or have no matching color objects in the same row remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors present in the grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects of the same color.', 'If an object is the only one of its color in its row, move it to the leftmost position within that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object at the leftmost position of the row.', 'The size of the merged object should be equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row.', 'Remove any excess objects after merging, as they are now part of the merged object.', 'Repeat this process for each row in the grid.']


Test case:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position within their row. If two objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge and expand to fill from the leftmost position in the row. Objects that do not have similar colors in the same row are unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost position, with the size equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row. Objects that are the only one of their color in their row or have no matching color objects in the same row remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors present in the grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects of the same color.', 'If an object is the only one of its color in its row, move it to the leftmost position within that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into a single object at the leftmost position of the row.', 'The size of the merged object should be equal to the total number of pixels of that color in the row.', 'Remove any excess objects after merging, as they are now part of the merged object.', 'Repeat this process for each row in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Object_3 of color 2 has been correctly moved and expanded. Object_4 of color 7 and Object_5 of color 3 are well-positioned at the start of their respective rows and have the correct size. However, for color 4, which has two objects of the same size in different rows (Object_6 and Object_7), both rows should have an object of size 1 at the beginning, but Object_7 is missing from the output, which is an error. It seems that the rule for handling objects of the same size but different rows has not been correctly applied, and thus Object_7 should still exist in the output at coordinates [[4, 0]]. Another issue is that the output format is inconsistent with the examples given, as it uses a list of objects with keys 'Object_X', which is not following the same notation as the given examples. The objects should be listed without these keys, maintaining consistency with the input format.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.
