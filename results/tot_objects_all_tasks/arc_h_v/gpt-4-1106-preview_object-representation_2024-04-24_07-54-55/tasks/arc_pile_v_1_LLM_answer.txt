You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern: Identify objects by color, move each object down until it cannot move further, if an object encounters another object of the same color, merge them into a larger object at the lowest position possible



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and coordinates.', "Determine the bottom-most position available for each object considering the grid's dimension and other objects' positions.", 'Move each object downwards in the grid to the determined position.', 'If an object encounters another object of the same color, merge them into a single object.', 'The merged object should occupy the lowest possible positions starting from the position where the merge occurred.', 'Continue the process until all objects are either merged or have reached the bottom of the grid or are blocked by different colored objects.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom of the grid; if two or more objects of the same color are in different rows, they merge and move to the bottom row; object size increases by the number of objects of the same color that are merged
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color, merge them into one object, move them to the bottom row of their respective columns, and adjust the size of the new object to reflect the total number of merged objects



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'Merge objects of the same color into one object.', 'Move merged objects to the bottom row of their respective columns within the grid.', 'Increase the size of the merged object to reflect the total number of original objects merged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move downwards until they either reach the bottom of the grid or encounter another object. When two objects of the same color become adjacent due to this movement, they merge into a single larger object.

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and coordinates.', "Determine the bottom-most position available for each object considering the grid's dimension and other objects' positions.", 'Move each object downwards in the grid to the determined position.', 'If an object encounters another object of the same color, merge them into a single object.', 'The merged object should occupy the lowest possible positions starting from the position where the merge occurred.', 'Continue the process until all objects are either merged or have reached the bottom of the grid or are blocked by different colored objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom of the grid; if two or more objects of the same color are in different rows, they merge and move to the bottom row; object size increases by the number of objects of the same color that are merged
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color, merge them into one object, move them to the bottom row of their respective columns, and adjust the size of the new object to reflect the total number of merged objects


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'Merge objects of the same color into one object.', 'Move merged objects to the bottom row of their respective columns within the grid.', 'Increase the size of the merged object to reflect the total number of original objects merged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 5]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move downwards until they either reach the bottom of the grid or encounter another object. When two objects of the same color become adjacent due to this movement, they merge into a single larger object. Objects that are not blocked by another object or the bottom grid edge will always move to the bottom.
overall pattern: Identify objects by color, move each object down until it cannot move further, if an object encounters another object of the same color, merge them into a larger object at the lowest position possible


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by their color and coordinates.', "Determine the bottom-most position available for each object considering the grid's dimension and other objects' positions.", 'Move each object downwards in the grid to the determined position.', 'If an object encounters another object of the same color, merge them into a single object.', 'The merged object should occupy the lowest possible positions starting from the position where the merge occurred.', 'Continue the process until all objects are either merged or have reached the bottom of the grid or are blocked by different colored objects.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 5]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [6, 6]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

output:
test case output dimension: [6, 6]
transformed objects: [{'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps seem to have been applied correctly for the most part, but there is an inconsistency with the color 7 objects. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, objects of the same color should merge and move to the bottom row of their respective columns. In the test case, two objects of color 7 are in different rows, yet they did not merge into a single object in the bottom-most row of their column. Instead, they stayed as two separate objects in rows 4 and 5. All other objects were correctly merged, moved to the bottom row of their respective columns, and had their sizes increased to reflect the total number of original objects merged. Therefore, the transformation for color 7 objects was not done according to the specified pattern.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid seems to have made the following errors: Object_7 and Object_8, both of color 3, should have been merged into a single object at the bottom of columns 4 and 5, with coordinates [[5, 4]], since there is no existing object of color 3 in column 5, and the size should be 2. However, the output incorrectly lists two separate objects in columns 4 and 5, suggesting an incorrect transformation. Similarly, the objects of color 2 (Object_4, Object_5, Object_6) have been correctly merged into a single object in column 3, but the size should be 3 reflecting the total number of original objects merged. The output lists the correct size but has incorrectly placed the merged object in columns 3, 4, and 5. The objects should rather be stacked vertically in the single column. Finally, Object_2 of color 7 should have been moved to the bottom of column 1, with coordinates [[5, 1]], instead of maintaining its original position. This suggests a misunderstanding of the transformation pattern. The correct transformation steps have not been applied consistently.",
