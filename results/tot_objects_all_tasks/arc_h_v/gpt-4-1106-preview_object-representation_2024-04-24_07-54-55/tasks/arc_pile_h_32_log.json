The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

Objects that start at the left border of the grid remain, while the leftmost object of a color expands to fill the row.

Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change based on their color and position in the grid. Objects that start at the left border of the grid remain, while the leftmost object of a color expands to fill the row. Other objects of the same color are removed.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each color starting from the lowest, retain only the leftmost object and expand it to the right to fill the row. Remove all other objects of the same color. Objects that do not start at the left border are removed regardless of their color.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all distinct colors present in the grid.', 'Starting with the lowest color value, locate the leftmost object for each color.', 'If the leftmost object for a color starts at the left border, expand it to the right to fill the entire row with that color.', 'Remove all other objects of the same color, regardless of their position.', 'Repeat the process for each color in ascending order until all colors have been processed.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [6, 6]\ntransformed objects: [{'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]], 'size': 6}, {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output grid does not match the expected output based on the transformation steps.

Object_7 and Object_8 both have color 2, but neither starts at the left border, so they should be removed entirely. The first object we should retain and expand is Object_9, which has color 6 and starts at the left border. The test output incorrectly shows Object_7 and Object_8 combined and expanded, but it correctly retains Object_9 without expansion. No other objects should be present in the output since none start at the left border. Therefore, the correct expected output should have only Object_9 with color 6 unchanged.

The transformation steps dictate that starting with the lowest color value, the leftmost object of each color that starts at the left border must be retained and expanded to fill the entire row, and all other objects of the same color should be removed. In the test input, Object_2 (color 3) and Object_9 (color 6) are the only objects that start at the left border and should, therefore, be retained and expanded. However, in the test output, Object_2 is missing, and Object_9 is correctly retained but not expanded. Moreover, Object_1 (color 9) incorrectly remains in the output, despite not starting at the left border. Object_7 and Object_8 (color 2) do not start at the left border and should not be in the output, but they are incorrectly included and expanded. The colors 4 and 7 are missing from the output, which is correct as their objects do not start at the left border.
