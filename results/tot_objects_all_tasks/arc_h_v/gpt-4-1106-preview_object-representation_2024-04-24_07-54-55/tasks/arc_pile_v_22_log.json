The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [3, 4]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}\n\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"decreased by 1\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"Object_3 and Object_4, both of color 2, have been merged into a single object of size 2 with new coordinates.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The movement is towards the bottom of the grid, and the size of an object may increase if it merges with another object of the same color. Objects that are not aligned with others of the same color, or are isolated, do not move.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object downwards within its column or row. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they merge and become one larger object. Continue moving objects down until they reach the bottom of the grid or until they cannot merge further. Objects that do not have the opportunity to merge remain in place.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions are relevant as they describe how objects interact with each other based on alignment and color.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

The movement is towards the bottom of the grid, and the size of an object may increase if it merges with another object of the same color. Objects that are not aligned with others of the same color, or are isolated, do not move.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object downwards within its column or row. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they merge and become one larger object. Continue moving objects down until they reach the bottom of the grid or until they cannot merge further. Objects that do not have the opportunity to merge remain in place.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify objects that are aligned vertically or horizontally with others of the same color.', 'Move each aligned object down within its column or row towards the bottom of the grid.', 'If an object encounters another object of the same color, merge them into a single larger object.', 'Continue moving objects down until they reach the bottom of the grid or cannot merge further.', 'Objects that are not aligned with others of the same color, or are isolated, remain in their original position.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_case_input_objects\": [\n    {\n      \"Object_1\": {\n        \"color\": 5,\n        \"coordinates\": [[0, 0]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_2\": {\n        \"color\": 7,\n        \"coordinates\": [[1, 1]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_3\": {\n        \"color\": 6,\n        \"coordinates\": [[1, 2]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_4\": {\n        \"color\": 6,\n        \"coordinates\": [[3, 2]],\n        \"size\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Object_5\": {\n        \"color\": 1,\n        \"coordinates\": [[2, 3], [3, 3]],\n        \"size\": 2\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"transformation\": \"Object_1 remains in place as it is isolated.

Object_3, which is color 6, has moved downwards and merged with another object of the same color, resulting in a single larger object at the bottom of the grid ([2,2], [3,2]). This transformation is consistent with the overall pattern and the detailed transformation steps. However, there is a mistake in the reporting of the transformed objects. Object_4 from the input, which is also color 6, seems to have been merged with Object_3 to form the new Object_3 in the output, but it is not listed in the transformed objects. Also, Object_5, which is color 1, remains unchanged as expected since it is already at the bottom and cannot merge further. Object_1 and Object_2 also remain in their original positions as they are isolated and not aligned with any other objects of the same color. The output is missing the entry for Object_4, which should have been merged with Object_3, and hence the reporting of the transformation is not entirely accurate.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output grid has been analyzed, and there are discrepancies in the transformation. Object_1 and Object_2 have not moved, which is correct as they are not aligned with other objects of the same color and should remain in their original positions according to the transformation steps. Object_3 and Object_4, which are both color 6, have been correctly moved down and merged into a new Object_3 with size 2, following the transformation steps. However, the output fails to include Object_4 in its list of transformed objects, which is an error because the objects have merged and should be represented as one larger object. Object_5 is listed correctly with its coordinates unchanged, as there are no other objects of color 1 to merge with. The overall pattern and transformation steps have been partially followed, but with an error in the merging representation.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}"
