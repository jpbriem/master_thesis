You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects consisting of a single pixel not on the leftmost column move to the leftmost column and increase their size by 1, adding a pixel to the left. Objects already on the leftmost column or spanning multiple columns have their non-leftmost pixels moved to the leftmost column, increasing size to form contiguous shapes. Single pixel objects on the rightmost column are removed.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Remove single pixel objects on the rightmost column. 2. Move all objects not entirely on the leftmost column to the leftmost column. 3. For objects that consist of a single pixel not on the leftmost column, add a pixel to the left to increase size by 1. 4. For objects spanning multiple columns, move non-leftmost pixels to the leftmost column to create a contiguous object starting from the row of the object's original leftmost pixel.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation appears to depend on whether an object touches the left border or not, and potentially its color or original position. Objects touching the left border may increase or decrease in size by 1 but remain in the same location. Objects not touching the left border move to the leftmost column and can increase in size by expanding to the left or get removed.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each object: if it touches the left border, keep its location the same and adjust its size by +/- 1 if necessary; if it does not touch the left border, move it to the leftmost column, potentially increase its size by adding pixels to the left, or remove it based on an as-yet undetermined condition related to color or position.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects consisting of a single pixel not on the leftmost column move to the leftmost column and increase their size by 1, adding a pixel to the left. Objects already on the leftmost column or spanning multiple columns have their non-leftmost pixels moved to the leftmost column, increasing size to form contiguous shapes. Single pixel objects on the rightmost column are removed.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Remove single pixel objects on the rightmost column. 2. Move all objects not entirely on the leftmost column to the leftmost column. 3. For objects that consist of a single pixel not on the leftmost column, add a pixel to the left to increase size by 1. 4. For objects spanning multiple columns, move non-leftmost pixels to the leftmost column to create a contiguous object starting from the row of the object's original leftmost pixel.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects on the same row move to the leftmost available columns, objects that are isolated with no other objects on the same row are removed, objects sharing color with another object on the same row increase in size by the number of those objects minus one and move left, other objects move left without size change
overall pattern: move objects to the leftmost available columns, remove isolated objects, increase the size of objects with the same color on the same row by the number of those objects minus one, otherwise keep the size the same



transformation steps: ['Identify objects on the same row.', 'For objects on the same row with the same color, count the objects and increase the size of the first object by the count minus one.', 'Remove isolated objects that have no other objects on the same row.', 'Move objects to the leftmost available columns on their respective rows, following the size modification if applicable.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects on the same row move to the leftmost available columns, objects that are isolated with no other objects on the same row are removed, objects sharing color with another object on the same row increase in size by the number of those objects minus one and move left, other objects move left without size change
overall pattern: move objects to the leftmost available columns, remove isolated objects, increase the size of objects with the same color on the same row by the number of those objects minus one, otherwise keep the size the same


transformation steps: ['Identify objects on the same row.', 'For objects on the same row with the same color, count the objects and increase the size of the first object by the count minus one.', 'Remove isolated objects that have no other objects on the same row.', 'Move objects to the leftmost available columns on their respective rows, following the size modification if applicable.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects consisting of a single pixel not on the leftmost column move to the leftmost column and increase their size by 1, adding a pixel to the left. Objects already on the leftmost column or spanning multiple columns have their non-leftmost pixels moved to the leftmost column, increasing size to form contiguous shapes. Single pixel objects on the rightmost column are removed.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Remove single pixel objects on the rightmost column. 2. Move all objects not entirely on the leftmost column to the leftmost column. 3. For objects that consist of a single pixel not on the leftmost column, add a pixel to the left to increase size by 1. 4. For objects spanning multiple columns, move non-leftmost pixels to the leftmost column to create a contiguous object starting from the row of the object's original leftmost pixel.


transformation steps: ['Remove all single pixel objects located in the rightmost column of the grid.', 'Move every object that is not entirely on the leftmost column to the leftmost column.', "For each object consisting of a single pixel that was not originally on the leftmost column, add an additional pixel to the left of the original pixel, therefore increasing the object's size by 1.", "For objects that span multiple columns, shift all pixels from non-leftmost columns to the leftmost column, arranging them to form a contiguous vertical shape starting from the row of the object's original leftmost pixel."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
