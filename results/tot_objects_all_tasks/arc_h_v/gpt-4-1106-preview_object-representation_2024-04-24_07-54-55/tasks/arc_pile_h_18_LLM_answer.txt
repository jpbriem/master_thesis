You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost positions in their respective rows, objects of the same color in the same row merge and grow in size. If an object reaches the first column, it is removed from the grid.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row, merge objects of the same color in the same row, and remove any object that reaches the first column.



transformation steps: ["Identify each object's row and its leftmost position", "Shift each object's pixels to the leftmost positions within its row", 'For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them by expanding the size of the object to include the positions of the merged object', 'If an object overlaps with the first column after merging, remove it from the grid']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 2], [5, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost positions in their respective rows, objects of the same color in the same row merge and grow in size. If an object reaches the first column, it is removed from the grid.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in its row, merge objects of the same color in the same row, and remove any object that reaches the first column.


transformation steps: ["Identify each object's row and its leftmost position", "Shift each object's pixels to the leftmost positions within its row", 'For objects of the same color in the same row, merge them by expanding the size of the object to include the positions of the merged object', 'If an object overlaps with the first column after merging, remove it from the grid']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost available position within their row. If an object's size becomes equal to the row size minus one after merging with another object of the same color, it grows to occupy the entire row. Objects that are in the rightmost position shrink from the right by one cell if they are not merging or growing.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Move all objects to the leftmost position in their respective rows. 2. Merge any objects of the same color that become adjacent as a result of this move. 3. If an object's size after merging is equal to the row size minus one, extend it to fill the entire row. 4. If an object is positioned at the rightmost cell of a row and it does not merge or grow, shrink it from the right by one cell.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input grid.', 'Move each object to the leftmost position within its row.', 'If an object merges with another object of the same color, combine them into a single object.', 'If the size of any object becomes equal to the row size minus one after merging, extend it to fill the entire row.', 'If an object is alone in the rightmost cell of its row and does not merge or grow, shrink it by removing the rightmost pixel.']


Test case:

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Move all objects to the leftmost position in their respective rows. 2. Merge any objects of the same color that become adjacent as a result of this move. 3. If an object's size after merging is equal to the row size minus one, extend it to fill the entire row. 4. If an object is positioned at the rightmost cell of a row and it does not merge or grow, shrink it from the right by one cell.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input grid.', 'Move each object to the leftmost position within its row.', 'If an object merges with another object of the same color, combine them into a single object.', 'If the size of any object becomes equal to the row size minus one after merging, extend it to fill the entire row.', 'If an object is alone in the rightmost cell of its row and does not merge or grow, shrink it by removing the rightmost pixel.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.

 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
