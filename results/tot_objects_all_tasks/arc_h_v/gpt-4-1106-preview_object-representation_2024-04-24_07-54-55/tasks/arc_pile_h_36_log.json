The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

First, the output does not show any object with color 1, which is correct according to the transformation rules as there were no other objects of color 1 to expand. However, Object_2, which was a single-pixel object of color 7, was not expanded as there were no other objects of color 7 to increase in size. Similarly, Object_5 of color 6 was removed correctly since it was a single pixel and there were no other objects of color 6. Lastly, the transformed Object_3 with color 4 was correctly moved to the leftmost position within its row, but the coordinates of the transformed object are not listed in the output. The output should explicitly show the transformed objects with their updated coordinates and sizes. The output only lists one transformed object (Object_3) but does not include any objects of color 1, 6, or 7 as expected since they were single-pixel objects and were correctly removed.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}\n------\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation steps were not entirely applied correctly to the test input grid. The steps correctly identified the single-pixel objects (Object_1, Object_2, Object_4, Object_5) and removed them from the grid. However, the transformation incorrectly increased the size of Object_3, which is of color 4, by only one pixel to the right, even though there are two single-pixel objects of color 4 (Object_3 and Object_4) in the input. According to the overall pattern, Object_3 should have increased in size by two pixels to the right, making its final size 4 pixels, not 3. Additionally, no objects of color 1, 6, or 7 remained in the output grid, which is correct since these colors were present only as single-pixel objects and were thus removed. However, the output does not include any objects that should have been moved to the leftmost position in their respective rows after the removal of single-pixel objects, as no other objects are present besides the incorrectly transformed Object_3.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid.

First step is to identify all single-pixel objects: Object_1 (color 1), Object_2 (color 7), and Object_5 (color 6) are single-pixel objects. According to the overall pattern, these should be removed and other objects of the same color should increase by one pixel to the right. However, there are no other objects with colors 1, 7, or 6 to increase in size. Thus, these single-pixel objects should simply be removed. Next, Object_3 and Object_4, both of color 4, should combine into one larger object, which correctly results in an object of size 3. However, since there is no other object of color 4 that is a single-pixel, the size should not increase. Lastly, all remaining objects should move to the leftmost position within their rows. The final output should only contain Object_3 (color 4) with coordinates [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], size 3, which is correct. However, the absence of Object_5 (color 6) suggests an error because there is no other object of the same color to absorb the single-pixel, hence it should have been moved to the leftmost position instead of being removed.\",\n  \"value\": 5\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output grid does not follow the transformation steps correctly. Step 2 specifies that for each single-pixel object, other objects of the same color should increase in size by adding one pixel to the right of their rightmost pixel if possible. However, in the test output, this step was not applied correctly. Object_3 and Object_4 are both color 4 objects, with Object_4 being a single-pixel object. Following the transformation steps, Object_3 should have increased in size by one pixel to the right, resulting in coordinates [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]. This part was done correctly. But then Object_4 should have been removed. The test output correctly removed Object_1, Object_2, and Object_5 since they are single-pixel objects, but it did not remove Object_4. All remaining objects should then move to the leftmost position within their respective rows. The test output correctly moved Object_3 (now of size 3) to the leftmost position. Unfortunately, the test output does not mention any other objects, which implies that it may have missed moving Object_2 to the leftmost position in its row, which should result in coordinates [[1, 0]], and the size should increase to 2 due to the single-pixel object of the same color being removed. Object_1 and Object_5 are correctly removed as they are single-pixel objects with no other objects of the same color to increase in size. Therefore, the test output is partially correct but has significant omissions and errors.\",\n  \"value\": 5\n}"
