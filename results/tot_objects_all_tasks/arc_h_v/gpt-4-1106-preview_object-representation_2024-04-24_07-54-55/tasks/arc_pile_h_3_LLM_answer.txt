You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there is only one object in the row, move it to the first column (column 0) of that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the row, merge them into a single object starting at the first column of that row and extending horizontally to the right, with the size equal to the number of these objects.', 'Apply the transformations to all rows independently.', 'Fill in the remaining cells of the grid with the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the leftmost column of their respective row, objects of the same color on the same row merge and extend horizontally
overall pattern: move each object to the leftmost column of its row while maintaining the row position, merge objects of the same color on the same row, extending their size horizontally by one pixel if they are not already adjacent


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid based on color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, move all objects to the leftmost available position within their respective row, while maintaining their row position.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color on the same row, merge them into a single object by extending the object horizontally. The merged object should start at the leftmost position of the first object and extend to the right by one additional pixel for each additional object of the same color merged.', 'The order of objects within a row should be maintained based on their original leftmost position before merging.', 'If an object of the same color is already adjacent to another, keep them as they are without extending the size further.', 'All other objects of unique colors or on different rows remain as single pixels.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects are transformed based on their color and position. Objects of the same color in the same row merge into one object starting at the first column, extending horizontally. Objects alone in a row move to the first column of that row
overall pattern: if an object is alone in its row, it moves to column 0 of that row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they merge into a single object starting in column 0 of that row, extending horizontally to the right


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there is only one object in the row, move it to the first column (column 0) of that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the row, merge them into a single object starting at the first column of that row and extending horizontally to the right, with the size equal to the number of these objects.', 'Apply the transformations to all rows independently.', 'Fill in the remaining cells of the grid with the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern: if an object is alone in its row, it moves to column 0 of that row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they merge into a single object starting in column 0 of that row, extending horizontally to the right


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there is only one object in the row, move it to the first column (column 0) of that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the row, merge them into a single object starting at the first column of that row and extending horizontally to the right, with the size equal to the number of these objects.', 'Apply the transformations to all rows independently.', 'Fill in the remaining cells of the grid with the background color (0).']

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects are transformed based on their color and position. Objects of the same color in the same row merge into one object starting at the first column, extending horizontally. Objects alone in a row move to the first column of that row
overall pattern: if an object is alone in its row, it moves to column 0 of that row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, they merge into a single object starting in column 0 of that row, extending horizontally to the right


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there is only one object in the row, move it to the first column (column 0) of that row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the row, merge them into a single object starting at the first column of that row and extending horizontally to the right, with the size equal to the number of these objects.', 'Apply the transformations to all rows independently.', 'Fill in the remaining cells of the grid with the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid analysis shows that some transformation steps were applied correctly, while others were not. The objects of color 8 in the first row were correctly merged into a single object, starting from column 0 and extending horizontally. However, the size of the merged object is incorrect. It should be of size 3, but it is listed as size 2 in the output. The objects of color 2 in the second row were also correctly merged, starting from column 0. The objects of color 7 in the third row should have been moved to the first column since there are no other objects of the same color in that row, but they were incorrectly left in their original positions. The object of color 1 in the fourth row and the object of color 9 in the fifth row were correctly moved to column 0. The remaining cells should be filled with the background color (0), and the output does not explicitly mention this, but it is assumed to be the case.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid has several inconsistencies when compared to the specified transformation steps. Firstly, for object_1, object_2, and object_3, which are all of color 8 and on the same row, the correct transformation would be to merge these objects into a single object starting at the first column of that row and extending horizontally. The output correctly shows this with {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}. However, for object_4 and object_5, which are both of color 2 and on the same row, the output also correctly merges them into [{'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}]. Yet for object_6, which has a size of 2 and spans two columns, the output fails to relocate this to the first column of its row, resulting in {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2} instead of the expected [{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}]. Finally, object_7 and object_8, which are alone in their respective rows, are correctly moved to the first column of their rows, resulting in {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1} and {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}. The overall transformation pattern is mostly followed except for the misplacement of object_6.",
