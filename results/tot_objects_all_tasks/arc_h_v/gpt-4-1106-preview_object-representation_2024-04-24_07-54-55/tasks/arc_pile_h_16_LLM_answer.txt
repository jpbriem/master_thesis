You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are not already at the leftmost position in their row or if there is more than one object of the same color in the same row
overall pattern: For any input, each object moves to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, they combine into a single object starting from the leftmost position in that row, extending rightward to cover the original span of the objects of the same color



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, combine their sizes and adjust the coordinates to create a single object starting from the leftmost position of that row.', 'For objects that are not at the leftmost position in their row and have not been combined, move the object to the leftmost available position within the same row.', 'The new size and coordinates of each transformed object should reflect the modifications done in the previous steps.', 'Remove any extraneous objects or pixels that no longer fit the pattern after the transformation.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects that have the same color and are located in the same row merge together, and all objects move to start from the leftmost column of their respective rows
overall pattern: any object in the input grid shifts its coordinates to start at the 0th column index of the same row, with its size either remaining the same or increasing if there are other objects of the same color in the same row to merge with



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects of the same color.', 'Merge objects of the same color in the same row by combining their coordinates and updating the size.', 'Shift all objects in a row to start from the 0th column index of that row.', 'If an object merges with another, increase its size to include all merged objects.', 'Leave a single occurrence of each color per row, extending from left to right.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 4], [1, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects that have the same color and are located in the same row merge together, and all objects move to start from the leftmost column of their respective rows
overall pattern: any object in the input grid shifts its coordinates to start at the 0th column index of the same row, with its size either remaining the same or increasing if there are other objects of the same color in the same row to merge with


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check for objects of the same color.', 'Merge objects of the same color in the same row by combining their coordinates and updating the size.', 'Shift all objects in a row to start from the 0th column index of that row.', 'If an object merges with another, increase its size to include all merged objects.', 'Leave a single occurrence of each color per row, extending from left to right.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 4], [1, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are not already at the leftmost position in their row or if there is more than one object of the same color in the same row
overall pattern: For any input, each object moves to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, they combine into a single object starting from the leftmost position in that row, extending rightward to cover the original span of the objects of the same color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, combine their sizes and adjust the coordinates to create a single object starting from the leftmost position of that row.', 'For objects that are not at the leftmost position in their row and have not been combined, move the object to the leftmost available position within the same row.', 'The new size and coordinates of each transformed object should reflect the modifications done in the previous steps.', 'Remove any extraneous objects or pixels that no longer fit the pattern after the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid appears to follow the overall pattern correctly with some minor discrepancies. First, Object_1, which is of color 7, is correctly combined from two separate objects into a single object spanning from the leftmost position in row 0, resulting in a size of 3. This matches the pattern where objects of the same color in the same row should combine and extend rightward. However, the combined object's coordinates are given as [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], which is one coordinate too many given the size of 3; it should have only two coordinates listed ([0,0] and [0,1]) since it started with a size of 2 and had one more pixel added, not two. Object_3 and Object_5 are correctly left unchanged as they are already at the leftmost position and do not have duplicates in the same row. Object_4, originally at coordinates [[2, 1], [2, 2]], is correctly moved to the leftmost position with the updated coordinates [[2, 0], [2, 1]]. However, there should be no Object_2 in the output as it has been combined into Object_1. The numbering of the objects in the output does not need to be sequential, but it should not include missing or combined objects. The test output has correctly removed Object_2 but retains its original numbering for other objects, which is not necessary but not incorrect per se.",

The output correctly reflects this transformation with Object_1 having coordinates [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2]] and size 3. Object_2 of color 7 is not listed in the output, which is correct since it was merged with Object_1. Object_3 of color 2 is already in the leftmost position and remains unchanged, which is correctly shown in the output. Object_4 of color 3 is not in the leftmost position and should be moved to the leftmost available position within the same row, resulting in coordinates [[2,0], [2,1]].

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

conditions: Objects change if they are not already at the leftmost position in their row or if there is more than one object of the same color in the same row
overall pattern: For any input, each object moves to the leftmost position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, they combine into a single object starting from the leftmost position in that row, extending rightward to cover the original span of the objects of the same color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'For each row in the grid, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, combine their sizes and adjust the coordinates to create a single object starting from the leftmost position of that row.', 'For objects that are not at the leftmost position in their row and have not been combined, move the object to the leftmost available position within the same row.', 'The new size and coordinates of each transformed object should reflect the modifications done in the previous steps.', 'Remove any extraneous objects or pixels that no longer fit the pattern after the transformation.']

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
