You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move downwards towards the second to last or bottom row of the grid based on the presence of other objects with the same color. Objects of the same color that end up on the same row will merge into a larger object, while unique colored objects will not merge and will only move to the bottom row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move objects towards the bottom of the grid. If an object has a matching color object, it moves to the second to last row and merges with any like-colored objects in the same row, increasing its size. Objects with unique colors move to the bottom row without changing size.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row of the grid. Single-pixel objects directly translate to the bottom maintaining their size. Objects with the same color either merge and stretch vertically to occupy space from their original vertical position down to the bottom or, if aligned, simply merge. Unique-colored objects translate to the bottom row without size change. Multi-pixel objects that do not share color with other objects remain in place.
overall pattern: Type of object that changes: Single-pixel and same-colored objects. Why it changes: To align at the bottom or merge based on color similarity. How it changes: Single-pixel objects are translated to the bottom row, same-colored objects merge and stretch vertically to the bottom, unique-colored objects move to the bottom row without size change.



transformation steps: ['Identify single-pixel objects and multi-pixel objects.', 'For single-pixel objects, check if they have the same color as any other object.', 'If single-pixel objects have the same color and are aligned vertically, merge them and stretch vertically to fill the space down to the bottom row.', "If single-pixel objects are not aligned vertically but have the same color, merge them and stretch vertically to fill the space from the topmost object's original position down to the bottom row.", 'For single-pixel objects with unique colors, translate them directly downward to the bottom row, maintaining their column alignment.', 'For multi-pixel objects that do not share a color with other objects, keep them in their original position.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: If an object is not at the bottom row, it moves down to the bottom row. If there are multiple objects of the same color, they merge into a single object at the bottom row, starting from the rightmost object's position and extending leftward to cover all the merged object's coordinates.
overall pattern: Move all objects that are not on the bottom row to the bottom row. If multiple objects of the same color exist, merge them into a single object at the bottom row, with the size equal to the sum of the sizes of the merged objects, starting from the rightmost object on the bottom row and extending leftward.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects not on the bottom row of the grid.', 'For each object not on the bottom row, move it vertically down to the bottom row while maintaining its column position.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object on the bottom row.', "To merge, start from the rightmost object of that color on the bottom row and extend leftward to cover all the merged object's coordinates.", 'The size of the merged object is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual objects being merged.', 'Apply the transformation to all objects except those which are already on the bottom row and do not require merging.']

#############################Sample Prompt:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row of the grid. Single-pixel objects directly translate to the bottom maintaining their size. Objects with the same color either merge and stretch vertically to occupy space from their original vertical position down to the bottom or, if aligned, simply merge. Unique-colored objects translate to the bottom row without size change. Multi-pixel objects that do not share color with other objects remain in place.
overall pattern: Type of object that changes: Single-pixel and same-colored objects. Why it changes: To align at the bottom or merge based on color similarity. How it changes: Single-pixel objects are translated to the bottom row, same-colored objects merge and stretch vertically to the bottom, unique-colored objects move to the bottom row without size change.


transformation steps: ['Identify single-pixel objects and multi-pixel objects.', 'For single-pixel objects, check if they have the same color as any other object.', 'If single-pixel objects have the same color and are aligned vertically, merge them and stretch vertically to fill the space down to the bottom row.', "If single-pixel objects are not aligned vertically but have the same color, merge them and stretch vertically to fill the space from the topmost object's original position down to the bottom row.", 'For single-pixel objects with unique colors, translate them directly downward to the bottom row, maintaining their column alignment.', 'For multi-pixel objects that do not share a color with other objects, keep them in their original position.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: If an object is not at the bottom row, it moves down to the bottom row. If there are multiple objects of the same color, they merge into a single object at the bottom row, starting from the rightmost object's position and extending leftward to cover all the merged object's coordinates.
overall pattern: Move all objects that are not on the bottom row to the bottom row. If multiple objects of the same color exist, merge them into a single object at the bottom row, with the size equal to the sum of the sizes of the merged objects, starting from the rightmost object on the bottom row and extending leftward.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects not on the bottom row of the grid.', 'For each object not on the bottom row, move it vertically down to the bottom row while maintaining its column position.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object on the bottom row.', "To merge, start from the rightmost object of that color on the bottom row and extend leftward to cover all the merged object's coordinates.", 'The size of the merged object is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual objects being merged.', 'Apply the transformation to all objects except those which are already on the bottom row and do not require merging.']

This means they should occupy the positions [[4,0], [4,1], [4,2]], which is correct in the output. However, there is an issue with the size attribute; it correctly reflects the sum of the sizes of the individual objects, but the coordinates suggest an overlap with other colors. Secondly, for color 2, the two objects should merge into a single object starting from the rightmost position at [[4,1]] and should extend leftward to [[4,0]]. However, the output incorrectly places a single object of size 2 at [[4,1]], which conflicts with the position of color 8. In addition, the size of the merged object for color 2 is incorrectly reported as 2, it should be 1 as there is no indication of a merge in the input. Thirdly, for color 7, the objects are correctly placed at the bottom row, but they should be at positions [[4,2], [4,3]], which is correctly reflected in the output. However, the size attribute should be 2, indicating that the two blocks are adjacent, which is correctly stated. Fourth, for color 1, the object is correctly moved to the bottom row, but it should be at position [[4,3]], which is occupied by color 7 and 2 in the output, suggesting an error. Lastly, for color 9, the object is correctly moved to the bottom row at position [[4,4]], which is correct in the output.

However, the issue arises with the color 2 objects; they should also merge into a single object on the bottom row, starting from the rightmost position (column 1) and extending leftward, resulting in coordinates [[4, 1]], not [[4, 1], [4, 2]] as stated. For color 7, the object should be at the bottom row with coordinates [[4, 2], [4, 3]], which is correctly placed. The color 1 object should be at [[4, 3]], but since that position is already taken by color 7, the object should either move to the left or be considered as overlapping, which is not clear in the overall pattern. Lastly, the color 9 object is correctly placed at [[4, 4]]. The output analysis shows that there are overlaps and potential misplacements which do not follow the described transformation steps and pattern accurately.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern: Move all objects that are not on the bottom row to the bottom row. If multiple objects of the same color exist, merge them into a single object at the bottom row, with the size equal to the sum of the sizes of the merged objects, starting from the rightmost object on the bottom row and extending leftward.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row of the grid. Single-pixel objects directly translate to the bottom maintaining their size. Objects with the same color either merge and stretch vertically to occupy space from their original vertical position down to the bottom or, if aligned, simply merge. Unique-colored objects translate to the bottom row without size change. Multi-pixel objects that do not share color with other objects remain in place.
overall pattern: Type of object that changes: Single-pixel and same-colored objects. Why it changes: To align at the bottom or merge based on color similarity. How it changes: Single-pixel objects are translated to the bottom row, same-colored objects merge and stretch vertically to the bottom, unique-colored objects move to the bottom row without size change.


transformation steps: ['Identify single-pixel objects and multi-pixel objects.', 'For single-pixel objects, check if they have the same color as any other object.', 'If single-pixel objects have the same color and are aligned vertically, merge them and stretch vertically to fill the space down to the bottom row.', "If single-pixel objects are not aligned vertically but have the same color, merge them and stretch vertically to fill the space from the topmost object's original position down to the bottom row.", 'For single-pixel objects with unique colors, translate them directly downward to the bottom row, maintaining their column alignment.', 'For multi-pixel objects that do not share a color with other objects, keep them in their original position.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}
