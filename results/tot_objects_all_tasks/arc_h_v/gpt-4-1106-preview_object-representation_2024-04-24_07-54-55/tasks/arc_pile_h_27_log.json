The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 4], [2, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_8: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_10: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}\n\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"The number of objects decreased from 6 to 5.\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"Object_1 moved from [0, 4] to [0, 0].

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.
