The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

According to the overall pattern, objects should move downward until they reach the bottom or stack on top of another object, and objects of the same color should merge into one, expanding the lower object to occupy the combined size of merged objects. In the test case, Object_1 and Object_2, having unique colors, moved down to the bottom of the grid without any merges, as no objects of the same color were below them. This is in line with steps 4 and 5. Object_3 is not mentioned in the output; this is correct because it has been merged into Object_4, which is now a single object with the size increased to 3, following steps 1 to 3. Object_5 also moved down without merging, as expected. All objects ended up at the bottom of the grid or expanded properly after merging, with no overlapping or incorrect placements.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The given test case output aligns with the transformation steps and overall pattern described. The objects have been moved downward until they reached the bottom or stacked on top of another object. No objects in this test case required merging because there are no objects of the same color positioned directly beneath one another. Each object's size remains unchanged except for Object_4, which correctly reflects the merged size of two '4' colored objects. All objects are at the bottom of the grid, which matches the expected outcome given the transformation rules. Object_3 is missing from the output, but this is correct since it merged with Object_4, making it part of the larger object. The object positions in the output respect the movement and merging rules, and the sizes are updated accordingly.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
