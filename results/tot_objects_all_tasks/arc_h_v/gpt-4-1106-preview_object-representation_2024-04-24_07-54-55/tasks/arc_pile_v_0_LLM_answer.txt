You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Objects of the same color in the same column combine into one larger object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based only on the input, move each object to the lowest available space within its column. If objects of the same color are in the same column, combine them either by expanding downwards or to the right, depending on the column's side.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based on the input, move each object down until it can no longer move.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down until they reach the bottom of the grid or rest on top of another object. When two objects of the same color meet, they combine into one larger object. The movement seems to be downwards, with the distance depending on the initial position and the presence of other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based on the input, move each object down until it can no longer move. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they combine into a single object with a size equal to their total combined size. The transformation does not affect objects already at the bottom.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down until they reach the bottom of the grid or rest on top of another object. When two objects of the same color meet, they combine into one larger object. The movement seems to be downwards, with the distance depending on the initial position and the presence of other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based on the input, move each object down until it can no longer move. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they combine into a single object with a size equal to their total combined size. The transformation does not affect objects already at the bottom.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid.', 'For each object, determine its lowest possible position by moving it down until it either reaches the bottom of the grid or rests on top of another object.', 'If two objects of the same color meet during this process, merge them into a single object. The position of the combined object is the lowest position that either of the original objects could occupy without the other being present.', 'The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', 'Repeat the process for all objects until none can move further.']

conditions: Objects at the bottom row are removed; Objects move towards the bottom row; Objects adjacent to the bottom row increase in size by combining with the bottom row object of the same color
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, remove objects at the bottom row, move all other objects down until they reach the bottom row, and if an object moves into a space that was occupied by an object of the same color, it combines with that object to increase in size



transformation steps: ['Identify and remove any objects that are located at the bottom row of the grid.', 'Move all remaining objects down towards the bottom row. Their horizontal positions should remain unchanged.', 'If an object moves into a space that corresponds to an object of the same color that was removed in step 1, combine those objects to increase the size of the moving object.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down until they reach the bottom of the grid or rest on top of another object. When two objects of the same color meet, they combine into one larger object. The movement seems to be downwards, with the distance depending on the initial position and the presence of other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based on the input, move each object down until it can no longer move. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they combine into a single object with a size equal to their total combined size. The transformation does not affect objects already at the bottom.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid.', 'For each object, determine its lowest possible position by moving it down until it either reaches the bottom of the grid or rests on top of another object.', 'If two objects of the same color meet during this process, merge them into a single object. The position of the combined object is the lowest position that either of the original objects could occupy without the other being present.', 'The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', 'Repeat the process for all objects until none can move further.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects at the bottom row are removed; Objects move towards the bottom row; Objects adjacent to the bottom row increase in size by combining with the bottom row object of the same color
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, remove objects at the bottom row, move all other objects down until they reach the bottom row, and if an object moves into a space that was occupied by an object of the same color, it combines with that object to increase in size


transformation steps: ['Identify and remove any objects that are located at the bottom row of the grid.', 'Move all remaining objects down towards the bottom row. Their horizontal positions should remain unchanged.', 'If an object moves into a space that corresponds to an object of the same color that was removed in step 1, combine those objects to increase the size of the moving object.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down until they reach the bottom of the grid or rest on top of another object. When two objects of the same color meet, they combine into one larger object. The movement seems to be downwards, with the distance depending on the initial position and the presence of other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based on the input, move each object down until it can no longer move. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they combine into a single object with a size equal to their total combined size. The transformation does not affect objects already at the bottom.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid.', 'For each object, determine its lowest possible position by moving it down until it either reaches the bottom of the grid or rests on top of another object.', 'If two objects of the same color meet during this process, merge them into a single object. The position of the combined object is the lowest position that either of the original objects could occupy without the other being present.', 'The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', 'Repeat the process for all objects until none can move further.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down until they reach the bottom of the grid or rest on top of another object. When two objects of the same color meet, they combine into one larger object. The movement seems to be downwards, with the distance depending on the initial position and the presence of other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based on the input, move each object down until it can no longer move. If an object encounters another object of the same color, they combine into a single object with a size equal to their total combined size. The transformation does not affect objects already at the bottom.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid.', 'For each object, determine its lowest possible position by moving it down until it either reaches the bottom of the grid or rests on top of another object.', 'If two objects of the same color meet during this process, merge them into a single object. The position of the combined object is the lowest position that either of the original objects could occupy without the other being present.', 'The size of the combined object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', 'Repeat the process for all objects until none can move further.']

The test output, however, shows Object_2 with a size of 3 instead of 2, Object_3 with a size of 4 instead of 3, and Object_4 with a size of 4 instead of 3. This indicates an incorrect application of the combination rule since there are no objects of matching colors to combine with at the bottom row. Therefore, the sizes of the objects in the test output are incorrect.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

transformation steps: ['Identify and remove any objects that are located at the bottom row of the grid.', 'Move all remaining objects down towards the bottom row.
