The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.
