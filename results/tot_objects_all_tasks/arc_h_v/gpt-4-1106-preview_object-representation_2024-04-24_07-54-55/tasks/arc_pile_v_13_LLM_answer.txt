You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects tend to move towards the bottom right. Objects at the top move down and expand. Objects in the bottom row are removed, merged, or remain static.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move objects towards the bottom right. If an object is in the top row, move it down one row and expand its size by one pixel to the right. If an object is in the bottom row, remove it, unless it can merge with another object to its right, in which case merge them and move the resulting object to the right. Objects not in the top or bottom rows do not move but may have their size increased if they are adjacent to an object that is being removed.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the rightmost side of the grid, with the bottom row having a priority for object placement. Objects combine if they are of the same color and on the same row. Objects are removed if they are on the bottom row and not the only object of their color. Object size and coordinates change to fit this pattern.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving and possibly merging objects to the rightmost columns of the grid. Objects on the bottom row are either removed or expanded to fill the rightmost cells if they are the only object of their color. The objects above the bottom row move to the right, maintaining order from top to bottom, and expand downwards to fill any available cells. The color remains the same, while size and coordinates are adjusted based on these rules.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the rightmost side of the grid, with the bottom row having a priority for object placement. Objects combine if they are of the same color and on the same row. Objects are removed if they are on the bottom row and not the only object of their color. Object size and coordinates change to fit this pattern.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving and possibly merging objects to the rightmost columns of the grid. Objects on the bottom row are either removed or expanded to fill the rightmost cells if they are the only object of their color. The objects above the bottom row move to the right, maintaining order from top to bottom, and expand downwards to fill any available cells. The color remains the same, while size and coordinates are adjusted based on these rules.



transformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the grid and their properties (color, coordinates, size).', 'For each object, check if it is the only object of its color on the bottom row. If it is, prepare to expand it to the rightmost cells. If not, mark it for removal.', 'For all other objects, calculate their new rightmost position based on their current row while respecting the order from top to bottom.', 'Combine objects of the same color if they end up in the same row.', 'Remove any objects that were marked for removal.', 'Update the object size and coordinates to match their new positions.', 'Fill in the grid based on the updated object information, ensuring that all objects are as right-aligned as possible, respecting the rules.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the rightmost side of the grid, with the bottom row having a priority for object placement. Objects combine if they are of the same color and on the same row. Objects are removed if they are on the bottom row and not the only object of their color. Object size and coordinates change to fit this pattern.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving and possibly merging objects to the rightmost columns of the grid. Objects on the bottom row are either removed or expanded to fill the rightmost cells if they are the only object of their color. The objects above the bottom row move to the right, maintaining order from top to bottom, and expand downwards to fill any available cells. The color remains the same, while size and coordinates are adjusted based on these rules.


transformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the grid and their properties (color, coordinates, size).', 'For each object, check if it is the only object of its color on the bottom row. If it is, prepare to expand it to the rightmost cells. If not, mark it for removal.', 'For all other objects, calculate their new rightmost position based on their current row while respecting the order from top to bottom.', 'Combine objects of the same color if they end up in the same row.', 'Remove any objects that were marked for removal.', 'Update the object size and coordinates to match their new positions.', 'Fill in the grid based on the updated object information, ensuring that all objects are as right-aligned as possible, respecting the rules.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they have the same color and their coordinates align either horizontally or vertically
overall pattern: Objects of the same color that align horizontally or vertically move to the bottom-right corner, merging into as few objects as possible by filling their entire row or column


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with the same color that are aligned either horizontally or vertically.', 'Determine the bottom-most row and the right-most column where these objects can be placed while still being aligned.', 'Move all objects of the same color to the identified bottom-most row or right-most column.', 'Merge these objects into as few objects as possible by filling the entire row or column they occupy.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the rightmost side of the grid, with the bottom row having a priority for object placement. Objects combine if they are of the same color and on the same row. Objects are removed if they are on the bottom row and not the only object of their color. Object size and coordinates change to fit this pattern.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving and possibly merging objects to the rightmost columns of the grid. Objects on the bottom row are either removed or expanded to fill the rightmost cells if they are the only object of their color. The objects above the bottom row move to the right, maintaining order from top to bottom, and expand downwards to fill any available cells. The color remains the same, while size and coordinates are adjusted based on these rules.


transformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the grid and their properties (color, coordinates, size).', 'For each object, check if it is the only object of its color on the bottom row. If it is, prepare to expand it to the rightmost cells. If not, mark it for removal.', 'For all other objects, calculate their new rightmost position based on their current row while respecting the order from top to bottom.', 'Combine objects of the same color if they end up in the same row.', 'Remove any objects that were marked for removal.', 'Update the object size and coordinates to match their new positions.', 'Fill in the grid based on the updated object information, ensuring that all objects are as right-aligned as possible, respecting the rules.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the rightmost side of the grid, with the bottom row having a priority for object placement. Objects combine if they are of the same color and on the same row. Objects are removed if they are on the bottom row and not the only object of their color. Object size and coordinates change to fit this pattern.
overall pattern: The transformation involves moving and possibly merging objects to the rightmost columns of the grid. Objects on the bottom row are either removed or expanded to fill the rightmost cells if they are the only object of their color. The objects above the bottom row move to the right, maintaining order from top to bottom, and expand downwards to fill any available cells. The color remains the same, while size and coordinates are adjusted based on these rules.


transformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the grid and their properties (color, coordinates, size).', 'For each object, check if it is the only object of its color on the bottom row. If it is, prepare to expand it to the rightmost cells. If not, mark it for removal.', 'For all other objects, calculate their new rightmost position based on their current row while respecting the order from top to bottom.', 'Combine objects of the same color if they end up in the same row.', 'Remove any objects that were marked for removal.', 'Update the object size and coordinates to match their new positions.', 'Fill in the grid based on the updated object information, ensuring that all objects are as right-aligned as possible, respecting the rules.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

For color 2, the objects at [[0, 3]] and [[3, 3]] are moved to [[3, 2], [3, 3]], filling the right-most column. No other colors have objects that align horizontally or vertically, so no other movements or mergers are required.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

According to the transformation steps, they should be placed in the bottom-most row and the right-most column, merging them into as few objects as possible. Since there are two objects of color 2, and they are aligned horizontally, they should occupy the bottom row, from the right-most column to the left. Therefore, the coordinates for the merged object of color 2 should be [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]] instead of [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]]. The objects for colors 5 and 1 have no aligned counterparts and therefore remain unchanged, which is correctly represented in the output.",
