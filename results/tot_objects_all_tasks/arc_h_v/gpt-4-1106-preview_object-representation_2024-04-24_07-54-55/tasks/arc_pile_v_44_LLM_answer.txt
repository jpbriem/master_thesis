You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects either move to the bottom row, expand to fill their row from their position to the rightmost column, or disappear based on their color and position relative to other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: Move objects to the bottom row. If an object is alone in its row, expand it to fill the row from its position to the rightmost column. If objects of the same color are in different rows, merge them into the bottommost object and expand to fill the row from the leftmost object's position to the rightmost column. Objects that are not alone and not in the bottom row disappear.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved vertically towards the bottom row of the grid. If an object is already at the bottom row, it remains unchanged. Objects on the same column merge into one larger object that fills the column up to the bottom row
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object down until it reaches the bottom row. If multiple objects share a column, merge them into a single object that extends from the highest object's original position down to the bottom row



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'For each object, determine its column position(s).', 'Move each object down to the bottom row of the grid, retaining its column position(s).', "If multiple objects share a column, merge them vertically, creating a new object that extends from the highest object's original row position down to the bottom row.", 'Objects that are already at the bottom row remain unchanged.', 'Output the transformed grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row while maintaining their x-coordinates. If objects have the same color, they merge into a single object, extending horizontally on the bottom row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the bottom row of the grid. If there are multiple objects with the same color, merge them into one object extending from the leftmost x-coordinate of the objects involved to the right, filling all the spaces in between on the bottom row.


transformation steps: ['Determine the bottom row of the grid (row with the highest index).', 'For each object in the input grid:', '  - Keep the x-coordinate (column index) the same.', '  - Move the object to the bottom row (change the y-coordinate to the highest index row).', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color:', '  - Merge these objects into a single object on the bottom row.', "  - The merged object's leftmost x-coordinate is the smallest x-coordinate among the objects being merged.", "  - The merged object's rightmost x-coordinate is the rightmost x-coordinate among the objects being merged.", '  - Fill in all the spaces between the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates with the color of the merged objects.']

#############################Sample Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved vertically towards the bottom row of the grid. If an object is already at the bottom row, it remains unchanged. Objects on the same column merge into one larger object that fills the column up to the bottom row
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object down until it reaches the bottom row. If multiple objects share a column, merge them into a single object that extends from the highest object's original position down to the bottom row


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'For each object, determine its column position(s).', 'Move each object down to the bottom row of the grid, retaining its column position(s).', "If multiple objects share a column, merge them vertically, creating a new object that extends from the highest object's original row position down to the bottom row.", 'Objects that are already at the bottom row remain unchanged.', 'Output the transformed grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row while maintaining their x-coordinates. If objects have the same color, they merge into a single object, extending horizontally on the bottom row.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the bottom row of the grid. If there are multiple objects with the same color, merge them into one object extending from the leftmost x-coordinate of the objects involved to the right, filling all the spaces in between on the bottom row.


transformation steps: ['Determine the bottom row of the grid (row with the highest index).', 'For each object in the input grid:', '  - Keep the x-coordinate (column index) the same.', '  - Move the object to the bottom row (change the y-coordinate to the highest index row).', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color:', '  - Merge these objects into a single object on the bottom row.', "  - The merged object's leftmost x-coordinate is the smallest x-coordinate among the objects being merged.", "  - The merged object's rightmost x-coordinate is the rightmost x-coordinate among the objects being merged.", '  - Fill in all the spaces between the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates with the color of the merged objects.']

Similarly, Object_4 and Object_5 should merge into a single object color 5 extending across coordinates [[4, 2], [4, 3]], and Object_6, Object_7, and Object_8 should merge into a single object color 7 extending across coordinates [[4, 3], [4, 4]]. Furthermore, the sizes of the merged objects are not correctly calculated. For color 9, the size should be 2, for color 5, the size should be 2, and for color 7, the size should be 3.

Therefore, the correct output for Object_2 should feature coordinates [[4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3]] with a size of 3.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color.
