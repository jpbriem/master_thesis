The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}\n\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"decreased from 9 to 5\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"Objects moved to the rightmost side of the grid, aligning with the bottom row.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects with the same color merge into one object; objects then move to the bottom of the grid, occupying the bottom-most available space in the rightmost columns; merged object size increases to fill the space\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Merge objects with the same color. 2. Shift merged objects to the bottom of the grid. 3. Place merged objects in the rightmost columns, filling the space from the bottom up. 4. Single objects move downward to the bottom-most row available in their column\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the same color and calculate their total size after merging.', 'Create a new object for each unique color with a size equal to the sum of the sizes of all objects of that color.', 'Determine the bottom-most available space in the rightmost columns of the grid.', 'Place the merged objects into the grid, filling the space from the bottom up in the rightmost columns.', 'Move single objects that did not merge downward to the bottom-most row available in their column.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

Objects with the same color that are vertically aligned merge together, and the resulting object occupies the bottom rows of the column, with its size set to the sum of the merged objects. Objects not vertically aligned with others of the same color simply move down without merging\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object down to the bottom rows of its respective column. If multiple objects of the same color are aligned vertically, merge them into a single object at the bottom of the column with the size equal to the sum of the individual objects. Objects not aligned vertically stay as individual objects but still move down to the bottom rows\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify objects in the grid by color and their coordinates.', 'For each column, check if there are multiple objects with the same color.', \"If objects of the same color align vertically, merge them by summing their sizes and adjust their coordinates to occupy the bottom rows of the column, with the merged object's topmost pixel starting from the row equal to (grid height - merged object size).\", 'If objects of the same color do not align vertically, move each object down to the bottom row of its column without changing its size.', 'For any objects that remain after merging, move them to the bottom of their respective column.', 'Ensure the grid dimensions remain unchanged after the transformation.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5]], 'size': 3}\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n    \"test_case_input_objects\": [\n        {\n            \"Object_1\": {\n                \"color\": 8,\n                \"coordinates\": [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]],\n                \"size\": 3\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Object_2\": {\n                \"color\": 7,\n                \"coordinates\": [[1, 1], [2, 1]],\n                \"size\": 2\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Object_3\": {\n                \"color\": 3,\n                \"coordinates\": [[0, 2]],\n                \"size\": 1\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Object_4\": {\n                \"color\": 3,\n                \"coordinates\": [[2, 2]],\n                \"size\": 1\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Object_5\": {\n                \"color\": 5,\n                \"coordinates\": [[5, 3]],\n                \"size\": 1\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Object_6\": {\n                \"color\": 6,\n                \"coordinates\": [[5, 4]],\n                \"size\": 1\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Object_7\": {\n                \"color\": 4,\n                \"coordinates\": [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5]],\n                \"size\": 3\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"transformation\": \"Move and merge objects to the bottom of their columns.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

Object_2 should merge with Object_7 to form a single object of color 7 with size 5 (2+3), but instead, Object_2 remains separate with size 2, and Object_7 (incorrectly named as Object_6 in the output) is also separate with size 3. Additionally, the placement of the objects in the rightmost columns is incorrect. According to the pattern, objects should fill the space from the bottom up; however, in the output, there is an empty spot at coordinates [5, 5] which should be the position of the bottom pixel of Object_1 (color 8). Instead, the bottom pixel for Object_1 is incorrectly placed at [4, 5]. Moreover, the single objects (Object_5 and Object_6) should move to the bottom-most row available in their column, but their final positions do not align with this step. Object_5, colored 5, should be at [5, 5] since it's a single object and should drop to the bottom row, but it is at [5, 2]. Object_6, colored 6, is correctly at [5, 1], which is in line with the rules.\",\n  \"value\": 3\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output grid does not seem to follow the transformation steps correctly based on the overall pattern and the detailed transformation steps provided. First, according to the transformation steps, objects of the same color should be merged into a single object. In the test input, we have two objects of color '3', which should be merged into one object with a size of 2. Next, the transformation steps state that merged objects should move to the bottom of the grid and occupy the bottom-most available space in the rightmost columns, with the size of the merged object increasing to fill the space. However, in the test output, we see Object_2 of color '7' and Object_6 of color '4' sharing the same coordinates at [4, 4], which indicates a mistake since two different objects cannot occupy the same space. Furthermore, Object_6 of color '4' is reported to have a size of 3 after the transformation, but its coordinates are overlapping with Object_2, which is incorrect. Also, Object_1 of color '8' is correctly placed at the bottom-right of the grid, filling the space from the bottom up. However, the placement of Object_3 of color '3' seems incorrect since it should be positioned further to the right, starting from the rightmost column available after placing Object_1. Additionally, the single objects (Object_4 of color '5' and Object_5 of color '6') are moved downward to the bottom-most row available in their column, but their positioning does not seem to adhere to the 'rightmost columns' rule as they are not placed in the available rightmost space.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid.
