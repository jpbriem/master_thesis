You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move left within their rows until the leftmost pixel of each object reaches the first column. If an object is alone in its row, it expands to occupy two pixels in that row. If there's more than one object in a row, all but the leftmost are removed. If an object is at the bottom right corner of the grid, it changes its color to 1 and moves to the bottom left corner
overall pattern: Move all objects within their respective rows to the leftmost column. If an object is alone in its row, extend it to two pixels. If multiple objects share a row, remove all but the leftmost. If an object is at the bottom right corner, change its color to 1 and move to the bottom left corner



transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is alone in its row.', 'If an object is alone in its row, move it to the leftmost position of the row. If it is not touching the left edge, extend it to occupy two pixels.', 'If there are multiple objects in a row, remove all objects except the leftmost one.', 'For the remaining objects in each row, if they are not touching the left edge, move them left until they touch the left edge.', 'If an object is located at the bottom right corner of the grid, change its color to 1 and move it to the bottom left corner of the grid.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects shift to the leftmost column of their row, objects of the same color that are on the same row merge and expand from left to right, objects of certain colors (e.g., color 5 in Example_2) may be removed
overall pattern: Shift objects to the leftmost column within their row, merge objects of the same color within the same row, remove objects based on specific color rules, increase the size of objects if they can expand to the left within the same row



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by color and coordinates.', 'For each row, shift objects to the leftmost column that they can occupy.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color on the same row, merge these objects.', 'The merged object should expand from the leftmost column it occupies to the right, filling up as many columns as the combined size of the merged objects.', 'If an object has a color that is designated to be removed after merging (e.g., color 5 in Example_2), then remove that object from the output grid.', 'Increase the size of objects if they are allowed to expand to the left within the same row after other objects have been shifted or removed.']

conditions: Objects move left within their rows until the leftmost pixel of each object reaches the first column. If an object is alone in its row, it expands to occupy two pixels in that row. If there's more than one object in a row, all but the leftmost are removed. If an object is at the bottom right corner of the grid, it changes its color to 1 and moves to the bottom left corner
overall pattern: Move all objects within their respective rows to the leftmost column. If an object is alone in its row, extend it to two pixels. If multiple objects share a row, remove all but the leftmost. If an object is at the bottom right corner, change its color to 1 and move to the bottom left corner


transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is alone in its row.', 'If an object is alone in its row, move it to the leftmost position of the row.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [3, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects shift to the leftmost column of their row, objects of the same color that are on the same row merge and expand from left to right, objects of certain colors (e.g., color 5 in Example_2) may be removed
overall pattern: Shift objects to the leftmost column within their row, merge objects of the same color within the same row, remove objects based on specific color rules, increase the size of objects if they can expand to the left within the same row


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid by color and coordinates.', 'For each row, shift objects to the leftmost column that they can occupy.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color on the same row, merge these objects.', 'The merged object should expand from the leftmost column it occupies to the right, filling up as many columns as the combined size of the merged objects.', 'If an object has a color that is designated to be removed after merging (e.g., color 5 in Example_2), then remove that object from the output grid.', 'Increase the size of objects if they are allowed to expand to the left within the same row after other objects have been shifted or removed.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_10: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_11: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move left within their rows until the leftmost pixel of each object reaches the first column. If an object is alone in its row, it expands to occupy two pixels in that row. If there's more than one object in a row, all but the leftmost are removed. If an object is at the bottom right corner of the grid, it changes its color to 1 and moves to the bottom left corner
overall pattern: Move all objects within their respective rows to the leftmost column. If an object is alone in its row, extend it to two pixels. If multiple objects share a row, remove all but the leftmost. If an object is at the bottom right corner, change its color to 1 and move to the bottom left corner


transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is alone in its row.', 'If an object is alone in its row, move it to the leftmost position of the row. If it is not touching the left edge, extend it to occupy two pixels.', 'If there are multiple objects in a row, remove all objects except the leftmost one.', 'For the remaining objects in each row, if they are not touching the left edge, move them left until they touch the left edge.', 'If an object is located at the bottom right corner of the grid, change its color to 1 and move it to the bottom left corner of the grid.']

Step 4: All remaining objects move to the left edge of their respective rows. Object_5, which was already at the edge, extends from 3 to 4 pixels, which seems incorrect according to the rules. It should remain 3 pixels. Step 5: Object_11 is at the bottom right corner, so it changes its color to 1 and moves to the bottom left corner.

Object_8 and Object_9 are in the same row; only Object_8 should have been kept and moved left.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Therefore, the test output grid seems to follow the pattern with a few errors, particularly with missing merges and expansion.",
