You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved down within their respective columns to occupy the bottom-most available cells. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same column, they combine into a single larger object located at the bottom of that column.

overall pattern: Identify objects with the same color in the same column and combine them into a single object at the bottom of that column, summing their sizes. Move all other objects down to the bottom-most available cells in their columns without changing their horizontal order.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved down within their respective columns to occupy the bottom-most available cells. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same column, they combine into a single larger object located at the bottom of that column. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the combined objects.
overall pattern: Identify objects with the same color in the same column and combine them into a single object at the bottom of that column, summing their sizes. Move all other objects down to the bottom-most available cells in their columns without changing their horizontal order.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved down within their respective columns to occupy the bottom-most available cells. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same column, they combine into a single larger object located at the bottom of that column. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the combined objects.
overall pattern: Identify objects with the same color in the same column and combine them into a single object at the bottom of that column, summing their sizes. Move all other objects down to the bottom-most available cells in their columns without changing their horizontal order.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the grid based on color and coordinates.', 'For each column in the grid:', {'1. Determine the objects that are located within that column and sort them by their vertical position (highest row index to lowest).': None}, {'2. Check if there are multiple objects of the same color in the column.': None}, {'3. If multiple objects of the same color are found, combine them into one object at the bottom of the column. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects.': None}, {'4. If there is only one object of a particular color in the column, move it to the bottom-most available cell within the column.': None}, 'Repeat this process for all columns in the grid to achieve the final transformed grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5]], 'size': 3}

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the lowest possible row in their respective columns; if two objects of the same color end up in the same row, they merge into a larger object; objects do not change columns
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object down to the lowest available space in its column; if an object with the same color is directly below, merge them, increasing the size of the lower object by the size of the upper one; if there is no matching color below, the object size remains unchanged


transformation steps: ['For each object, determine its current column and the lowest available row in that column.', 'Move the object vertically down to the determined row without changing its column.', 'If there is an object of the same color already in the lowest row, merge the moving object with it, increasing the size of the merged object upwards.', 'Ensure that objects do not move horizontally, and that the transformation preserves the column of each pixel.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}

Finally, Object_5 with color 8 should also be at the bottom of its column, which is correct in the output, but it is incorrectly listed as Object_4.

transformation steps: ['For each object, determine its current column and the lowest available row in that column.', 'Move the object vertically down to the determined row without changing its column.', 'If there is an object of the same color already in the lowest row, merge the moving object with it, increasing the size of the merged object upwards.', 'Ensure that objects do not move horizontally, and that the transformation preserves the column of each pixel.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.
