You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change?

Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are located in the first column of their row expand to fill the first three columns of that row. Objects not in the first column expand to fill the first two columns of their row. Objects are merged or removed based on the presence of objects of the same color in the first three columns.
overall pattern: Objects in the first column grow to a size of 3 and take over columns 1-3 of their row. Objects not in the first column grow to a size of 2 and are relocated to columns 0-1 of their row. If two objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into the object occupying the first column.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects expand to fill up to 3 contiguous horizontal cells if they are the only object of their color in the row; objects are removed if they are not the leftmost of their color
overall pattern: if an object is the only one of its color in a row, it expands horizontally to fill a size of 3; all other objects of the same color in the grid that are not the leftmost are removed



transformation steps: ['Identify the leftmost object of each color in each row.', 'If an object is the only one of its color in its row, expand it horizontally to fill a size of 3 cells.', 'Remove all objects of the same color that are not the leftmost in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:

	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that start at column 0 expand to occupy up to column 2; Objects that start at column 1 also expand to fill up to column 2 if they are alone in their row; Objects that do not start at column 0 or 1 are removed; Objects of the same color in the same row merge
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, objects starting at column 0 or 1 expand or merge based on the conditions, filling up to column 2, while other objects are removed


transformation steps: ['Identify objects that start at column 0 or 1.', 'For each object that starts at column 0, leave it unchanged unless there is another object of the same color on the same row, then merge and expand them to fill up to column 2.', 'For each object that starts at column 1 and is alone in its row, expand it to fill up to column 2.', 'Remove objects that do not start at column 0 or 1 unless they are in the same row and share the same color with an object that is being expanded, then merge them.', 'Objects of the same color in the same row should be merged as part of the expansion process.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

transformation steps: ['Identify the leftmost object of each color in each row.', 'If an object is the only one of its color in its row, expand it horizontally to fill a size of 3 cells.', 'Remove all objects of the same color that are not the leftmost in the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that start at column 0 expand to occupy up to column 2; Objects that start at column 1 also expand to fill up to column 2 if they are alone in their row; Objects that do not start at column 0 or 1 are removed; Objects of the same color in the same row merge
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, objects starting at column 0 or 1 expand or merge based on the conditions, filling up to column 2, while other objects are removed


transformation steps: ['Identify objects that start at column 0 or 1.', 'For each object that starts at column 0, leave it unchanged unless there is another object of the same color on the same row, then merge and expand them to fill up to column 2.', 'For each object that starts at column 1 and is alone in its row, expand it to fill up to column 2.', 'Remove objects that do not start at column 0 or 1 unless they are in the same row and share the same color with an object that is being expanded, then merge them.', 'Objects of the same color in the same row should be merged as part of the expansion process.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [4, 4]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_3': {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input grid contains four objects, and according to the transformation steps, we should consider the following: Object_1 starts at column 0 and should remain unchanged. Object_2 starts at column 1 but is not alone in its row, so it doesn't meet the condition to be expanded and should be removed. Object_3 starts at column 0 and occupies up to column 2 already, so it meets the conditions and remains unchanged. Object_4 starts at column 0 and should remain unchanged. The test output grid correctly keeps Object_1, Object_3, and Object_4. However, it incorrectly removes Object_2 instead of expanding it to fill up to column 2, as it is alone in its row if we consider the removal of objects not starting at column 0 or 1 first. Therefore, the test output grid is incorrect. Object_2 should have been expanded to fill up to column 2 before being removed, resulting in {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid does not correctly reflect the transformation steps based on the overall pattern and the conditions provided. Object_1 started at column 0 and is left unchanged correctly. Object_2 started at column 1 and is not alone in its row, so it should be removed, but it is absent in the output, which is correct. Object_3 started at column 0 and should be left unchanged, which is correctly reflected in the output. Object_4 started at column 0 and should also be left unchanged, which is correctly reflected in the output. However, according to the transformation steps, objects in the same row should merge and expand to fill up to column 2 if they are of the same color. Since there are no such objects in the test input grid, no merging is required. Therefore, the transformation steps appear to have been correctly applied to the test input to create the test output.",
