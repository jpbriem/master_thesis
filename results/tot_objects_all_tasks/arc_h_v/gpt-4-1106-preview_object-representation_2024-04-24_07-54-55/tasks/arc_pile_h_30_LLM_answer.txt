You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern: For each object, check if there is another object with the same color in the same row. If yes, merge them into a single object and locate them at the left-most position of the grid starting from the top row. If no, simply move the object to the left-most position of its respective row. The color and size of the object are preserved unless it merges, in which case the size is the sum of the original sizes.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, determine if there are multiple objects with the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color in a row, merge them into a single object. Calculate the new size by summing the sizes of the merged objects.', 'Position each object, merged or not, at the left-most available position in its respective row.', 'Maintain the original color for each object after the transformation.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [3, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are transformed based on their color. Objects with the same color are merged into single objects. These objects are then aligned to the leftmost side of the grid (column 0), with their size increased to occupy consecutive columns starting from column 0. The objects maintain their original row positions.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each color present in the input, merge all objects of the same color into one object. Place the merged object at the leftmost column of the grid (column 0) and stretch it horizontally to fill consecutive columns. Maintain the row position of the original objects. The size of the new object is the combined size of all merged objects.



transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors of objects within the grid.', 'For each color, find all objects with that color.', 'Merge objects of the same color into a single object, combining their sizes.', 'Place the new merged object in the leftmost column of the grid (column 0).', 'Stretch the merged object horizontally to fill consecutive columns, maintaining the original row position of the topmost object of that color.', 'Repeat the process for each color present in the input grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

overall pattern:

If yes, merge them into a single object and locate them at the left-most position of the grid starting from the top row. If no, simply move the object to the left-most position of its respective row. The color and size of the object are preserved unless it merges, in which case the size is the sum of the original sizes.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, determine if there are multiple objects with the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color in a row, merge them into a single object. Calculate the new size by summing the sizes of the merged objects.', 'Position each object, merged or not, at the left-most available position in its respective row.', 'Maintain the original color for each object after the transformation.']

#############################Sample Prompt:

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [3, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are transformed based on their color. Objects with the same color are merged into single objects. These objects are then aligned to the leftmost side of the grid (column 0), with their size increased to occupy consecutive columns starting from column 0. The objects maintain their original row positions.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each color present in the input, merge all objects of the same color into one object. Place the merged object at the leftmost column of the grid (column 0) and stretch it horizontally to fill consecutive columns. Maintain the row position of the original objects. The size of the new object is the combined size of all merged objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors of objects within the grid.', 'For each color, find all objects with that color.', 'Merge objects of the same color into a single object, combining their sizes.', 'Place the new merged object in the leftmost column of the grid (column 0).', 'Stretch the merged object horizontally to fill consecutive columns, maintaining the original row position of the topmost object of that color.', 'Repeat the process for each color present in the input grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the left-most position in their respective rows. Objects of the same color merge into a single object, increasing their size while maintaining the same color. The merging starts from the top row and moves down.
overall pattern: For each object, check if there is another object with the same color in the same row. If yes, merge them into a single object and locate them at the left-most position of the grid starting from the top row. If no, simply move the object to the left-most position of its respective row. The color and size of the object are preserved unless it merges, in which case the size is the sum of the original sizes.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, determine if there are multiple objects with the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color in a row, merge them into a single object. Calculate the new size by summing the sizes of the merged objects.', 'Position each object, merged or not, at the left-most available position in its respective row.', 'Maintain the original color for each object after the transformation.']

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the left-most position in their respective rows. Objects of the same color merge into a single object, increasing their size while maintaining the same color. The merging starts from the top row and moves down.
overall pattern: For each object, check if there is another object with the same color in the same row. If yes, merge them into a single object and locate them at the left-most position of the grid starting from the top row. If no, simply move the object to the left-most position of its respective row. The color and size of the object are preserved unless it merges, in which case the size is the sum of the original sizes.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid by their color and coordinates.', 'For each row in the grid, determine if there are multiple objects with the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color in a row, merge them into a single object. Calculate the new size by summing the sizes of the merged objects.', 'Position each object, merged or not, at the left-most available position in its respective row.', 'Maintain the original color for each object after the transformation.']

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [3, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are transformed based on their color. Objects with the same color are merged into single objects. These objects are then aligned to the leftmost side of the grid (column 0), with their size increased to occupy consecutive columns starting from column 0. The objects maintain their original row positions.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each color present in the input, merge all objects of the same color into one object. Place the merged object at the leftmost column of the grid (column 0) and stretch it horizontally to fill consecutive columns. Maintain the row position of the original objects. The size of the new object is the combined size of all merged objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify all unique colors of objects within the grid.', 'For each color, find all objects with that color.', 'Merge objects of the same color into a single object, combining their sizes.', 'Place the new merged object in the leftmost column of the grid (column 0).', 'Stretch the merged object horizontally to fill consecutive columns, maintaining the original row position of the topmost object of that color.', 'Repeat the process for each color present in the input grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [4, 4]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_3': {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}}]

The correct output for the objects of color 6 should have filled columns 0, 1, and 2, which it does, but for the objects of color 5, the output should stretch to columns 0, 1, 2, and 3, making a total size of 4 instead of the indicated size of 3.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
