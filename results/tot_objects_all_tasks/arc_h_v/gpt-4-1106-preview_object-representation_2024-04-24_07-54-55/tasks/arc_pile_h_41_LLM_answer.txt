You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost position of their respective rows. If multiple objects are in the same row, they merge into one object that spans the entire row horizontally. Objects that were not leftmost in their row in the input are removed.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the leftmost position in the same row, objects of the same color in a row merge and increase in size according to the number of objects merged, objects of color 9 do not change in size
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in the same row, if there are multiple objects of the same color in the row, merge them into one object starting from the leftmost position and increase the size by the total number of pixels of the merged objects, objects of color 9 do not merge or change size



transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the grid by its color and coordinates.', 'For each row, move all objects to the leftmost position while maintaining their row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, merge these objects into one, starting from the leftmost position.', 'The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects that were merged.', 'Objects of color 9 are moved to the leftmost position but do not merge with other objects of color 9, nor do they change in size.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are aligned to the leftmost position of their respective rows. If objects share the same color, they are merged into a single object starting from the leftmost coordinate of the first object in the row. If an object is of color 7, its size increases by 1. Objects of color 9 remain unchanged in size.
overall pattern: For any input, align each object to the leftmost position of its row. Merge objects of the same color into one object starting from the leftmost position. Increase the size of color 7 objects by 1. Keep the size of color 9 objects unchanged.



transformation steps: ["Step 1: Identify each object's color and coordinates within the grid.", 'Step 2: Align each object to the leftmost position of its respective row.', 'Step 3: If objects share the same color, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost coordinate of the first object in the row.', 'Step 4: If an object is of color 7, increase its size by 1 pixel.', 'Step 5: If an object is of color 9, keep its size unchanged.', 'Step 6: Place the transformed objects back into the grid, maintaining their new positions and sizes.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 1], [5, 2], [5, 3]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1], [5, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are aligned to the leftmost position of their respective rows. If objects share the same color, they are merged into a single object starting from the leftmost coordinate of the first object in the row. If an object is of color 7, its size increases by 1. Objects of color 9 remain unchanged in size.
overall pattern: For any input, align each object to the leftmost position of its row. Merge objects of the same color into one object starting from the leftmost position. Increase the size of color 7 objects by 1. Keep the size of color 9 objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ["Step 1: Identify each object's color and coordinates within the grid.", 'Step 2: Align each object to the leftmost position of its respective row.', 'Step 3: If objects share the same color, merge them into a single object starting from the leftmost coordinate of the first object in the row.', 'Step 4: If an object is of color 7, increase its size by 1 pixel.', 'Step 5: If an object is of color 9, keep its size unchanged.', 'Step 6: Place the transformed objects back into the grid, maintaining their new positions and sizes.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects move to the leftmost position in the same row, objects of the same color in a row merge and increase in size according to the number of objects merged, objects of color 9 do not change in size
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost position in the same row, if there are multiple objects of the same color in the row, merge them into one object starting from the leftmost position and increase the size by the total number of pixels of the merged objects, objects of color 9 do not merge or change size


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the grid by its color and coordinates.', 'For each row, move all objects to the leftmost position while maintaining their row.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color in the same row, merge these objects into one, starting from the leftmost position.', 'The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects that were merged.', 'Objects of color 9 are moved to the leftmost position but do not merge with other objects of color 9, nor do they change in size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [4, 4],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}

According to the transformation steps, objects of the same color in the same row should be merged into one, starting from the leftmost position, and the size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the individual objects that were merged. Object_1 of color 7 initially had a size of 2 and Object_2 of color 7 had a size of 1. When merged, the size should be 2 + 1 = 3, which is correctly represented in the coordinates and size. However, the coordinates for Object_1 of color 7 are incorrectly listed as [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]. Since the initial size was 2 and after merging with another object of size 1, the coordinates should span three positions starting from the leftmost position, which is [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], so this part is correct. For Object_3 of color 3, initially there is one object at [[2, 0]] and another at [[2, 2], [2, 3]]. After moving and merging, the resulting object should have a size of 3, which is also correctly represented in the coordinates and size. For the other objects, the transformation seems to be correctly applied: they are moved to the leftmost position without changing size, except for the merging of objects of the same color.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
