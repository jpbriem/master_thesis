You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down to the lowest empty position if they are not already on the bottom row; objects of the same color merge into a single object increasing in size by their original sizes
overall pattern: Each object of the same color merges and moves to the bottom-most position within the grid that is not already occupied by another object of a different color, maintaining its original color and increasing in size by the sum of the sizes of merged objects



transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is on the bottom row. If not, proceed with the transformation.', 'For objects not on the bottom row, check if there are other objects of the same color.', 'If there are other objects of the same color, merge them into a single object, summing their sizes.', 'Move the merged object, or single object if no merge occurred, to the bottom-most row that is not already occupied by another object of a different color.', 'Maintain the original color of the objects after merging and moving.', 'Perform these steps for all objects in the grid.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color are merged into a single object at the bottom of their initial column if there are multiple objects of that color in the column. Objects that are alone in their row and color remain unchanged. The size of the merged object becomes the sum of the sizes of the original objects
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color in each column. If there is more than one object of the same color in a column, merge them into a single object at the bottommost position of that column. The size of the new object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects with unique colors in their respective columns remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within each column.', 'For each column, group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color in a column:', '  - If there is more than one object, merge them into a single object at the bottom of the column.', '  - Calculate the new size of the merged object as the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', '  - Set the color of the new object to the color of the merged objects.', '  - Remove the original objects from the grid.', 'For objects with a unique color in their respective columns, leave them unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move down to the lowest empty position if they are not already on the bottom row; objects of the same color merge into a single object increasing in size by their original sizes
overall pattern: Each object of the same color merges and moves to the bottom-most position within the grid that is not already occupied by another object of a different color, maintaining its original color and increasing in size by the sum of the sizes of merged objects


transformation steps: ['For each object, determine if it is on the bottom row. If not, proceed with the transformation.', 'For objects not on the bottom row, check if there are other objects of the same color.', 'If there are other objects of the same color, merge them into a single object, summing their sizes.', 'Move the merged object, or single object if no merge occurred, to the bottom-most row that is not already occupied by another object of a different color.', 'Maintain the original color of the objects after merging and moving.', 'Perform these steps for all objects in the grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color are merged into a single object at the bottom of their initial column if there are multiple objects of that color in the column. Objects that are alone in their row and color remain unchanged. The size of the merged object becomes the sum of the sizes of the original objects
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color in each column. If there is more than one object of the same color in a column, merge them into a single object at the bottommost position of that column. The size of the new object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects with unique colors in their respective columns remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within each column.', 'For each column, group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color in a column:', '  - If there is more than one object, merge them into a single object at the bottom of the column.', '  - Calculate the new size of the merged object as the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', '  - Set the color of the new object to the color of the merged objects.', '  - Remove the original objects from the grid.', 'For objects with a unique color in their respective columns, leave them unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [6, 6]
transformed objects: [{'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [5, 2]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 3}, {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[5, 5]], 'size': 1}]

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [4, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color are merged into a single object at the bottom of their initial column if there are multiple objects of that color in the column. Objects that are alone in their row and color remain unchanged. The size of the merged object becomes the sum of the sizes of the original objects
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color in each column. If there is more than one object of the same color in a column, merge them into a single object at the bottommost position of that column. The size of the new object is the sum of sizes of all merged objects. Objects with unique colors in their respective columns remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within each column.', 'For each column, group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color in a column:', '  - If there is more than one object, merge them into a single object at the bottom of the column.', '  - Calculate the new size of the merged object as the sum of the sizes of the original objects.', '  - Set the color of the new object to the color of the merged objects.', '  - Remove the original objects from the grid.', 'For objects with a unique color in their respective columns, leave them unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Value Outputs:
{
    "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid does not seem to follow the transformation steps correctly. The first issue is with Object_1 (color 9), whose coordinates are listed in reverse order in the output; the correct coordinates, according to the transformation steps, should be [[4, 0], [5, 0]], if we assume that the objects fill up from the bottom-most part of the column upwards. However, the order of coordinates is not explicitly stated as a requirement in the transformation steps, so this might not be a critical error. Object_2 (color 3) has correctly merged and moved to the bottom positions. Object_3 and Object_4 (both color 7) should have merged into a single object and then moved to the bottom, which they did. Object_5 and Object_6 (both color 4) correctly merged into a single object with a size of 3 and moved to the bottom. Object_7 and Object_8 (both color 2) also correctly merged and moved to the bottom. Object_9 (color 6) remained in its place as it was already on the bottom row. However, there is a critical issue with the output for Object_4 and Object_5: their coordinates have been inverted. Object_4 (color 4) should occupy the bottom-most positions in column 3, and Object_5 (color 2) should occupy the bottom-most positions in column 4. As a result, the correct output for Object_4 should be {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[5, 3], [4, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}, and for Object_5, it should be {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 2}. Therefore, the output is incorrect due to the misplacement of these objects.",

------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid seems to have correctly applied the transformation steps with one exception. The coordinates of Object_1 are not sorted correctly. The object should have been moved as a whole to the bottom, thus the coordinates should be [[4,0], [5,0]] instead of [[5,0], [4,0]]. All other objects appear to have been correctly merged and moved to the bottom of their respective columns, maintaining their original colors and the sum of their sizes. However, the sorting of coordinates is important and the error in Object_1's coordinates suggests a possible misunderstanding of the object movement rules or a mistake in the transformation process.",
