You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Each object in a row moves to the leftmost positions available. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies consecutive leftmost positions in that row, increasing in size accordingly. Objects that are alone in their color in a row move to the leftmost position without changing size.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost available position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into one object that spans the leftmost positions in that row. Objects that are alone in their color in a row retain their size and simply move to the leftmost position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:

overall pattern:
conditions: Each object in a row moves to the leftmost positions available. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies consecutive leftmost positions in that row, increasing in size accordingly. Objects that are alone in their color in a row move to the leftmost position without changing size.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost available position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into one object that spans the leftmost positions in that row. Objects that are alone in their color in a row retain their size and simply move to the leftmost position.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the same row.', 'For each row, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object occupying consecutive leftmost positions in that row.', 'Increase the size of the merged object by the total number of pixels of all merged objects.', 'If there is a single object of a particular color in a row, move it to the leftmost position without changing its size.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost column. If there are multiple objects of the same color, the largest one increases in size by absorbing the smaller ones which are then removed from the grid.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost column. If an object has the same color as another, only the largest object of that color remains and increases in size by the sum of sizes of the removed objects of the same color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid along with their colors, coordinates, and sizes.', 'Move each object to the leftmost column of the grid while maintaining their respective row positions.', 'For objects of the same color, identify the largest object based on size.', 'Increase the size of the largest object by the sum of sizes of the smaller objects of the same color.', "Extend the largest object's coordinates to the right by the number of pixels equal to the new size.", 'Remove the smaller objects of the same color from the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Each object in a row moves to the leftmost positions available. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies consecutive leftmost positions in that row, increasing in size accordingly. Objects that are alone in their color in a row move to the leftmost position without changing size.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost available position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into one object that spans the leftmost positions in that row. Objects that are alone in their color in a row retain their size and simply move to the leftmost position.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the same row.', 'For each row, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object occupying consecutive leftmost positions in that row.', 'Increase the size of the merged object by the total number of pixels of all merged objects.', 'If there is a single object of a particular color in a row, move it to the leftmost position without changing its size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost column. If there are multiple objects of the same color, the largest one increases in size by absorbing the smaller ones which are then removed from the grid.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost column. If an object has the same color as another, only the largest object of that color remains and increases in size by the sum of sizes of the removed objects of the same color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid along with their colors, coordinates, and sizes.', 'Move each object to the leftmost column of the grid while maintaining their respective row positions.', 'For objects of the same color, identify the largest object based on size.', 'Increase the size of the largest object by the sum of sizes of the smaller objects of the same color.', "Extend the largest object's coordinates to the right by the number of pixels equal to the new size.", 'Remove the smaller objects of the same color from the grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the leftmost column. If there are multiple objects of the same color, the largest one increases in size by absorbing the smaller ones which are then removed from the grid.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost column. If an object has the same color as another, only the largest object of that color remains and increases in size by the sum of sizes of the removed objects of the same color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid along with their colors, coordinates, and sizes.', 'Move each object to the leftmost column of the grid while maintaining their respective row positions.', 'For objects of the same color, identify the largest object based on size.', 'Increase the size of the largest object by the sum of sizes of the smaller objects of the same color.', "Extend the largest object's coordinates to the right by the number of pixels equal to the new size.", 'Remove the smaller objects of the same color from the grid.']

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Each object in a row moves to the leftmost positions available. If multiple objects of the same color are in the same row, they merge into a single object that occupies consecutive leftmost positions in that row, increasing in size accordingly. Objects that are alone in their color in a row move to the leftmost position without changing size.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object to the leftmost available position in its row. If there are multiple objects of the same color in a row, merge them into one object that spans the leftmost positions in that row. Objects that are alone in their color in a row retain their size and simply move to the leftmost position.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the same row.', 'For each row, check if there are multiple objects of the same color.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, merge them into a single object occupying consecutive leftmost positions in that row.', 'Increase the size of the merged object by the total number of pixels of all merged objects.', 'If there is a single object of a particular color in a row, move it to the leftmost position without changing its size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}

The analysis shows that for the most part, these rules were followed correctly in the test case output.\n\nObject_1 and Object_2 which share the same color (9) and row (0) were merged correctly into a single object occupying the leftmost positions ([0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]) with the correct size (3).

Object_6, Object_7, and Object_8 were also correctly merged into Object_6_7_8 with the correct coordinates and size.\n\nHowever, there is a critical issue with Object_3 coordinates. The original coordinates were ([1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]), but the output has them as ([1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]). Since there were no other objects of color 1 in row 1, Object_3 should not have been expanded to the leftmost position, and its size should have remained unchanged. Therefore, the transformation step 'If there is a single object of a particular color in a row, move it to the leftmost position without changing its size' was not followed correctly for Object_3.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].
