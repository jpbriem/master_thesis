You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand to the left until they reach another object or the grid boundary. An object that encounters another object of a different color changes to that color and continues expanding. Objects can absorb other objects that they touch during expansion, resulting in the disappearance of the absorbed object.
overall pattern: For each object, expand to the left by one cell. If during expansion, an object with a different color is encountered, change the color of the expanding object to the encountered color and continue expansion. If an object expands into the space of another object, remove the absorbed object from the grid.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: single pixel objects are removed unless they are the only object of their color, objects of the same color merge if they are on the same row, objects expand or shift to the left to fill all adjacent background pixels in the same row
overall pattern: objects shift to the leftmost position while expanding to fill any adjacent background pixels in the same row, single pixel objects are removed unless they are unique in color, objects of the same color merge if they are on the same row


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color located on the same row', 'Merge objects of the same color into one object starting from the leftmost pixel of the first object', 'Expand merged objects to fill all adjacent background pixels in the same row', 'Remove single pixel objects that are not the only occurrence of their color', 'If objects of the same color are not on the same row, do not merge them, but still shift left to fill adjacent background pixels if any', 'If an object is the only one of its color, do not remove it regardless of its size']

#############################Sample Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand to the left until reaching the grid edge, objects change color to the color of the closest object to the left if it is of a different color, objects disappear if their rightmost pixel is at the grid's edge
overall pattern: Each object expands to the left by the number of empty columns to its left until the grid edge, changing color to the closest object on the left with a different color if there is one, and disappears if it touches the grid's right edge


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', "Determine the position of each object and check whether it is touching the grid's right edge.", "For each object that is not touching the grid's right edge:", '  - Expand the object to the left until reaching the grid edge.', '  - If there is a different colored object immediately to the left, the expanding object inherits its color.', "Remove any objects that are touching the grid's right edge."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: single pixel objects are removed unless they are the only object of their color, objects of the same color merge if they are on the same row, objects expand or shift to the left to fill all adjacent background pixels in the same row
overall pattern: objects shift to the leftmost position while expanding to fill any adjacent background pixels in the same row, single pixel objects are removed unless they are unique in color, objects of the same color merge if they are on the same row


transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color located on the same row', 'Merge objects of the same color into one object starting from the leftmost pixel of the first object', 'Expand merged objects to fill all adjacent background pixels in the same row', 'Remove single pixel objects that are not the only occurrence of their color', 'If objects of the same color are not on the same row, do not merge them, but still shift left to fill adjacent background pixels if any', 'If an object is the only one of its color, do not remove it regardless of its size']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:

According to the transformation steps, objects of the same color should merge if they are on the same row and expand to fill all adjacent background pixels in the same row. This has been correctly applied to the objects of color 9, 6, 4, and 7. The color 9 object has shifted to the left correctly, and the color 7 objects have merged and expanded as expected. The discrepancy is with the objects of color 2. Since there are two single pixel objects of color 2 and no other objects of the same color on their rows, they should not have been removed. Instead, each should have shifted to the leftmost position without merging, resulting in two separate objects of color 2 at coordinates [[4, 0]] and [[4, 1]], each with a size of 1. Instead, the output incorrectly shows a merged object of color 2 with a size of 3, which violates the pattern since the two color 2 objects were on different rows and should not have been merged.",

According to the pattern, single pixel objects should be removed unless they are the only object of their color. In the input, Object_6 and Object_7, both of color 2, are single pixel objects and should be removed since they are not the only occurrences of their color. The test output, however, shows a merged object of color 2 with size 3. This is incorrect as the single pixel objects should not have merged and should have been removed instead.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 4]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 0], [5, 1]], 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand to the left until reaching the grid edge, objects change color to the color of the closest object to the left if it is of a different color, objects disappear if their rightmost pixel is at the grid's edge
overall pattern: Each object expands to the left by the number of empty columns to its left until the grid edge, changing color to the closest object on the left with a different color if there is one, and disappears if it touches the grid's right edge


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input grid.', "Determine the position of each object and check whether it is touching the grid's right edge.", "For each object that is not touching the grid's right edge:", '  - Expand the object to the left until reaching the grid edge.', '  - If there is a different colored object immediately to the left, the expanding object inherits its color.', "Remove any objects that are touching the grid's right edge."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 5}, {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]], 'size': 5}, {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3], [3, 4]], 'size': 5}, {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]], 'size': 5}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were not entirely followed correctly. According to the pattern, objects are supposed to expand to the left until they reach the grid edge. However, objects that are already at the grid's right edge should disappear. In the test case, Object_1, which has a size of 3 and is at the right edge, should have disappeared in the output rather than expanding. Additionally, objects that are not touching the right edge should expand to the left and change color if there is a differently colored object to their left. Object_2 correctly expanded and retained its color since it was already at the left edge. Object_3 and Object_4 expanded correctly, but Object_5, which should have disappeared, incorrectly expanded. Object_6 and Object_7 are single pixels, which should have expanded to the left, but Object_7, being at the right edge, should have disappeared. The test output shows all objects, including those at the right edge, incorrectly expanded and none disappeared, contradicting the specified transformation pattern.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps seem to have been applied incorrectly to the test input grid. According to the overall pattern, objects should expand to the left until reaching the grid edge, and objects that touch the grid's right edge should disappear. In the test case output, Object_1 should have been removed since it touches the grid's right edge, but it is missing from the output. Additionally, Object_6 and Object_7 should have combined into a single object with color 2, as they are adjacent after expansion; instead, they are listed as separate objects. Also, there is a mistake in the transformation of colors. Object_2, Object_4, and Object_6 should all change their color to 9 since Object_1 is the closest different colored object to the left. Instead, they retain their original colors in the output. Object_5 should disappear as it touches the grid's right edge, but it is incorrectly included in the output with an expanded size. Lastly, Object_3 correctly expanded, but its color should have changed to 6, the closest object on the left with a different color. The test output seems to ignore the requirement for objects to inherit the color of the closest different colored object to the left.",
