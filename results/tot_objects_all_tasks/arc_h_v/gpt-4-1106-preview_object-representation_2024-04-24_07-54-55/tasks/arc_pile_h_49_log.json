Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [1, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects at the grid edge (top or left) either expand or shift towards the starting edge\noverall pattern: For each object, if it is at the top edge, it shifts left by the number of cells equivalent to its distance from the left edge; if it is at the left edge, it expands to the right by the number of cells equivalent to its distance from the top edge\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify objects at the top edge or left edge of the grid.', 'For objects at the top edge, shift the object to the left by as many cells as its distance from the left edge.', 'For objects at the left edge, expand the object to the right by as many cells as its distance from the top edge.', 'For objects at the top-left corner, no transformation is applied.', 'Objects not at the edge are not transformed.', 'Ensure that out-of-bounds shifts are not applied.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.
