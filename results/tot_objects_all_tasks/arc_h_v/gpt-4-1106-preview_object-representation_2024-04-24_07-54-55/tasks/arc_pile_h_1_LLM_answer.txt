You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand or shift to fill the leftmost column of their row, objects of the same color on the same row merge, single-color objects disappear if no leftward expansion is possible
overall pattern: For each row, start with the leftmost pixel and expand or merge objects of the same color to occupy the leftmost positions available, objects that cannot expand to the leftmost column or do not merge are removed



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the same row', 'For each object, check if it can expand to the leftmost available position within its row', 'If an object can expand left, extend its leftmost pixel(s) to the first column', 'If an object cannot expand left, it is removed unless it merges with another object', 'Merge objects of the same color in the same row, starting from the leftmost pixel', 'Continue until all objects have been processed']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 0], [4, 1]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [3, 3]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [2, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand or shift to fill the leftmost column of their row, objects of the same color on the same row merge, single-color objects disappear if no leftward expansion is possible
overall pattern: For each row, start with the leftmost pixel and expand or merge objects of the same color to occupy the leftmost positions available, objects that cannot expand to the leftmost column or do not merge are removed


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the same row', 'For each object, check if it can expand to the leftmost available position within its row', 'If an object can expand left, extend its leftmost pixel(s) to the first column', 'If an object cannot expand left, it is removed unless it merges with another object', 'Merge objects of the same color in the same row, starting from the leftmost pixel', 'Continue until all objects have been processed']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [6, 6],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [1, 1]], 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[2, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_9: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Object_3 (color 6) is also correctly placed at the leftmost column ([2, 0]). However, Object_4's transformation seems incorrect. The original input has three separate objects of color 2 in row 3. According to the overall pattern, these should be merged into a single object starting from the leftmost column. The output correctly shows them merged and starting from the leftmost column, but it missed the object at coordinate [3, 4]. Object_5's transformation is correct, as the two objects of color 3 in row 4 are merged starting from the leftmost column. Object_6 (color 1) is correctly positioned at the leftmost column. However, there was a missed opportunity to merge Object_1 (color 8) with the background to effectively move it to the leftmost position as per the rules, but since the background is not considered an object, this may be acceptable. Object_4 should have had four pixels instead of three, as the original input had a third object of color 2 in the same row. The test output fails to account for this object. Hence, the test output grid does not fully comply with the transformation steps.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next, we check if each object can expand to the leftmost available position within its row. If an object can expand left, its leftmost pixel(s) extend to the first column; if not, it is removed unless it merges with another object of the same color. Objects of the same color in the same row are merged, starting from the leftmost pixel. Following these steps, the test output grid should only contain objects that were either able to expand to the leftmost column, merge with other objects, or both. In the provided transformation, Object_1 (color 8) on the first row could not expand to the left and should be removed. Object_2 (color 7) on the second row is already at the leftmost position and remains unchanged. Object_3 (color 6) on the third row could not expand to the left and should be removed. Objects 4, 5, and 6 (all color 2) on the fourth row can merge and expand to the left, which is correctly done in the transformation. Objects 7 and 8 (both color 3) on the fifth row can also merge and expand to the left, which is correctly done. Object_9 (color 1) on the last row could not expand to the left and should be removed. The final output contains only the remaining objects after the transformation, correctly following the pattern and steps.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
