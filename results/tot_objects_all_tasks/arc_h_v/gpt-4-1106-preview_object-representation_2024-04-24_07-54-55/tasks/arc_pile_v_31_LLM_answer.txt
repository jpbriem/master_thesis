You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row unless they are already on the bottom two rows. Objects of the same color above the bottom two rows merge into a single object in the bottom row, increasing their combined size. Single objects retain their color and size when moving to the bottom row.
overall pattern: Move single objects to the bottom row without changing their color or size. Merge objects of the same color into one object in the bottom row, combining their sizes. Objects already in the bottom two rows remain unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid that are not in the bottom two rows.', 'For each object identified, check if there are other objects of the same color also not in the bottom two rows.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, combine their sizes and move them as a single object to the bottom row at the corresponding column of their first appearance from left to right.', 'If there is only one object of a color not in the bottom two rows, move it to the bottom row at the corresponding column.', 'Leave objects that are already in the bottom two rows at their current location and unchanged.', 'After transformation, ensure that no objects except the bottom two rows contain any objects unless they are merged objects in the bottom row.']

overall pattern: Move single-pixel objects to the bottom of their column. Merge objects of the same color in the bottom row into one. Keep larger objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify single-pixel objects and their column positions.', 'Move single-pixel objects to the bottom of their respective columns.', 'If the bottom row of a column already contains an object of the same color, merge them into a single object, extending the size horizontally to the right.', 'Leave multi-pixel objects in their original positions.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 5]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [6, 6], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'coordinates': [[4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_7: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_8: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 3]], 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [4, 4], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the bottom row unless they are already on the bottom two rows. Objects of the same color above the bottom two rows merge into a single object in the bottom row, increasing their combined size. Single objects retain their color and size when moving to the bottom row.
overall pattern: Move single objects to the bottom row without changing their color or size. Merge objects of the same color into one object in the bottom row, combining their sizes. Objects already in the bottom two rows remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid that are not in the bottom two rows.', 'For each object identified, check if there are other objects of the same color also not in the bottom two rows.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, combine their sizes and move them as a single object to the bottom row at the corresponding column of their first appearance from left to right.', 'If there is only one object of a color not in the bottom two rows, move it to the bottom row at the corresponding column.', 'Leave objects that are already in the bottom two rows at their current location and unchanged.', 'After transformation, ensure that no objects except the bottom two rows contain any objects unless they are merged objects in the bottom row.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Single-pixel objects move to the bottom row of their respective columns. If there are multiple objects of the same color in the bottom row, they merge into a single object, increasing their size accordingly. Objects that are not single pixels remain in their original positions.
overall pattern: Move single-pixel objects to the bottom of their column. Merge objects of the same color in the bottom row into one. Keep larger objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify single-pixel objects and their column positions.', 'Move single-pixel objects to the bottom of their respective columns.', 'If the bottom row of a column already contains an object of the same color, merge them into a single object, extending the size horizontally to the right.', 'Leave multi-pixel objects in their original positions.']

Instead, the output combined these objects into a new multi-pixel object of color 9 with coordinates at [4, 2], [4, 3], which is incorrect as per the overall pattern that requires larger objects to remain unchanged. The multi-pixel object of color 1 at [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3] was correctly left in its original position, adhering to Step 4.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the grid that are not in the bottom two rows.', 'For each object identified, check if there are other objects of the same color also not in the bottom two rows.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same color, combine their sizes and move them as a single object to the bottom row at the corresponding column of their first appearance from left to right.', 'If there is only one object of a color not in the bottom two rows, move it to the bottom row at the corresponding column.', 'Leave objects that are already in the bottom two rows at their current location and unchanged.', 'After transformation, ensure that no objects except the bottom two rows contain any objects unless they are merged objects in the bottom row.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[3, 0]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 3}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[3, 4]], 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [5, 5]
transformed objects: [{'Object_1': {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_2': {'color': 9, 'coordinates': [[4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]], 'size': 3}}, {'Object_3': {'color': 6, 'coordinates': [[4, 0]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_4': {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 4]], 'size': 1}}, {'Object_5': {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid does not match the transformation steps described. First, Object_1 of color 8 should have all its pixels moved to the bottom row (row 4), but they remain in their original position in rows 0, 1, and 2. This is incorrect as per the transformation steps. Second, Object_2 of color 9 is correctly merged and moved to the bottom row, but the coordinates are not in the correct order. They should be aligned with the first appearance of the color from left to right, meaning they should be [[4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]] instead of [[4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]]. However, there is an incorrect duplication of coordinates here, suggesting a typo as the coordinates are repeated in the analysis. Third, Object_3 of color 6 is moved correctly to the bottom row. Fourth, Object_4 of color 1 is moved to the bottom row but should not be located at [4, 4]; that coordinate should belong to Object_6 (color 2), as it is the first appearance of the color from left to right. Lastly, Object_5 of color 2 is moved to the bottom row but placed incorrectly at [4, 1]; it should be at [4, 4]. Therefore, the test output grid does not follow the transformation steps accurately and contains multiple errors.",

------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid does not align with the transformation steps provided. Firstly, Object_1 is an object of color 8 with a size of 3 in the input grid, occupying the coordinates [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]]. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, this object should remain unchanged as it is already located in the second to the bottom row. The test output correctly leaves this object unchanged. However, Object_2, which is of color 9 and initially has two separate parts ([[0, 2], size: 1] and [[2, 2], [3, 2], size: 2]), should be merged into a single object and moved to the bottom row. The correct merged coordinates in the output should be [[4, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4]], and the size should be 3, as per the transformation steps. The test output correctly merged Object_2 and placed it in the bottom row. Object_3 of color 6 is correctly moved from [3, 0] to the bottom row at [4, 0], as per the transformation steps. Object_4 is of color 1 and occupies three coordinates [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3]]. According to the transformation rules, since it's not in the bottom two rows, it should also be moved to the bottom row. However, the output incorrectly places it at [4, 4], suggesting that it was incorrectly treated as a single pixel object, and its size was reduced to 1. It should have remained size 3. Object_5 of color 2 is correctly moved from [3, 4] to [4, 1]. Furthermore, there seems to be a mismatch in the test output description, where the objects are labeled as 'Object_1' through 'Object_5', but as per the input, they should be labeled as 'Object_2', 'Object_4', 'Object_1', 'Object_5', and 'Object_6' respectively, to match their input labels. The overall rating for the test output must account for the incorrect handling of Object_4's size and location, as well as the labeling issues.",
