The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation of objects depends on their color and size. Single-pixel objects (size 1) change to color 3, while larger objects change to color 5 if their size is less than 4 and to color 3 if their size is 4 or more. The original color 6 of the objects is consistently changed.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects by consecutive same-colored pixels. If the object is a single pixel (size 1), change its color to 3. For larger objects, if the size is less than 4, change the color to 5, and if the size is 4 or more, change the color to 3. Position and size remain unchanged.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify objects defined by consecutive pixels of the same color.', 'For each identified object, check the size of the object.', 'If the object size is 1 (single-pixel object), change its color to 3.', 'If the object size is greater than 1, determine the new color based on size:', '  - If the object size is less than 4, change the color to 5.', '  - If the object size is 4 or more, change the color to 3.', 'Keep the position and size of each object unchanged in the output sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
