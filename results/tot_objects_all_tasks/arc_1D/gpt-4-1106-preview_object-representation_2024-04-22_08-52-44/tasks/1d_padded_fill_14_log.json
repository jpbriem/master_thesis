The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Each pair of objects with the same color that are separated by a consistent gap have been merged. The new objects have the correct start index of the first object and the end index of the second object, and the sizes of the new objects are correctly calculated as the sum of the original object sizes plus the gap size. In this case, the gap size is 10 (13 - 2 - 1) for the first pair, 10 (33 - 22 - 1) for the second pair, and 10 (53 - 42 - 1) for the third pair. Each new object size is 12, which is the sum of the individual object sizes (1 each) plus the gap (10), resulting in 1 + 1 + 10 = 12.

First, the input sequence objects are identified and grouped by color 7. Then, pairs of objects with consistent gaps between them are identified.

According to the transformation steps, new objects are created that expand from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object in each identified pair, and their size is calculated as the sum of the original sizes plus the gap size. The sizes of the original objects are 1, and the gap size is 10, resulting in the new size being 1 + 10 + 1 = 12 for each pair. The output correctly reflects these new sizes and object positions.
