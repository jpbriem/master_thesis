You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The conditions that determine the changes are based on the presence of an object with color 9. This color 9 object swaps its color with the other object present and switches positions with it. The size of the objects does not change.
overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object with color 9 and another object of a different color, swap the colors of these two objects and their positions. The size of the objects remains the same. The object with color 9 moves to the position immediately after the original position of the other object, and the other object moves to the original position of the object with color 9.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The conditions that determine the changes are based on the presence of an object with color 9. This color 9 object swaps its color with the other object present and switches positions with it. The size of the objects does not change.
overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object with color 9 and another object of a different color, swap the colors of these two objects and their positions. The size of the objects remains the same. The object with color 9 moves to the position immediately after the original position of the other object, and the other object moves to the original position of the object with color 9.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object with color 9 and the other object.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Move the object that was originally color 9 to the position immediately following the original position of the other object.', 'Move the other object to the original position of the object that was originally color 9.', 'Ensure that the sizes of the objects remain unchanged during the transformation.']

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: The conditions that determine the changes are based on the presence of an object with color 9. This color 9 object swaps its color with the other object present and switches positions with it. The size of the objects does not change.
overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object with color 9 and another object of a different color, swap the colors of these two objects and their positions. The size of the objects remains the same. The object with color 9 moves to the position immediately after the original position of the other object, and the other object moves to the original position of the object with color 9.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object with color 9 and the other object.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Move the object that was originally color 9 to the position immediately following the original position of the other object.', 'Move the other object to the original position of the object that was originally color 9.', 'Ensure that the sizes of the objects remain unchanged during the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 15],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 15]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not correctly follow the transformation steps. According to the transformation steps, the object with color 9 should swap colors with the other object and switch positions with it. The object with the original color 9 should be moved to the position immediately following the original position of the other object, and the other object should be moved to the original position of the object with color 9. However, in the test output, the object that was originally color 9 (Object_2) has moved to the correct new position (start_index: 9), but the other object (Object_1) has not moved to the original position of the object with color 9. The original position of the object with color 9 was start_index: 7, end_index: 7. Object_1 should have moved to this position instead of remaining at start_index: 2, end_index: 5. Therefore, the transformation has been applied incorrectly.",

{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly identifies the two objects with their colors and sizes. According to the overall pattern, the colors of the two objects should be swapped, and their positions should switch. The object with color 9 should move to the position immediately after the original position of the other object, and the object with color 7 should move to the original position of the object with color 9. However, in the provided test output, only the colors were swapped, while the positions remained unchanged.

Since the positions did not change, the transformation was not applied correctly.", "value": 4}
