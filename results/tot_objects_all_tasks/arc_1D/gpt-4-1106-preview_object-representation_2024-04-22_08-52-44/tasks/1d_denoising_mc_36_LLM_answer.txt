You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on the presence of outlier colors within a sequence of pixels that form an object. An outlier color is any color that appears less frequently than the predominant color within the object.
overall pattern: For any object in the sequence, identify the predominant color and replace all non-predominant colors with the predominant color to create a uniform object. The predominant color is determined by the color that appears most frequently within the object. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the first color in the sequence takes precedence.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on the presence of different colors within them. All non-background pixels inside an object change to the color that occurs most frequently at the beginning of the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the predominant color at the start of the object and change all the pixels within that object to that color. The size of the object does not change.



transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'For each object, determine the color that occurs most frequently at the start of the object.', 'Replace all non-background pixels within the object with the identified predominant color.', 'Retain the original size and position of each object in the output sequence.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on the presence of outlier colors within a sequence of pixels that form an object. An outlier color is any color that appears less frequently than the predominant color within the object.
overall pattern: For any object in the sequence, identify the predominant color and replace all non-predominant colors with the predominant color to create a uniform object. The predominant color is determined by the color that appears most frequently within the object. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the first color in the sequence takes precedence.



transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each color it contains.', 'Determine the predominant color for each object. In case of a tie in frequency, select the color that appears first within the object.', 'Replace all the pixels of outlier colors within the object with the determined predominant color.', 'The output sequence should reflect the modified objects, with their new uniform color, maintaining the original positions and sizes of the objects.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on the presence of outlier colors within a sequence of pixels that form an object. An outlier color is any color that appears less frequently than the predominant color within the object.
overall pattern: For any object in the sequence, identify the predominant color and replace all non-predominant colors with the predominant color to create a uniform object. The predominant color is determined by the color that appears most frequently within the object. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the first color in the sequence takes precedence.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each color it contains.', 'Determine the predominant color for each object. In case of a tie in frequency, select the color that appears first within the object.', 'Replace all the pixels of outlier colors within the object with the determined predominant color.', 'The output sequence should reflect the modified objects, with their new uniform color, maintaining the original positions and sizes of the objects.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on the presence of outlier colors within a sequence of pixels that form an object. An outlier color is any color that appears less frequently than the predominant color within the object.
overall pattern: For any object in the sequence, identify the predominant color and replace all non-predominant colors with the predominant color to create a uniform object. The predominant color is determined by the color that appears most frequently within the object. If there is a tie for the most frequent color, the first color in the sequence takes precedence.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each color it contains.', 'Determine the predominant color for each object. In case of a tie in frequency, select the color that appears first within the object.', 'Replace all the pixels of outlier colors within the object with the determined predominant color.', 'The output sequence should reflect the modified objects, with their new uniform color, maintaining the original positions and sizes of the objects.']
