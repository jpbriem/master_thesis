Therefore, the first and second objects should not merge (distance is 3), the second and third objects should merge (distance is 4), the third and fourth objects should not merge (distance is 3), the fourth and fifth objects should merge (distance is 4), and the fifth and sixth objects should not merge (distance is 3).
