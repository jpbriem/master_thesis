According to the transformation steps, this object should be moved 2 places to the right, which would change its start index to 6 and its end index to 19, while retaining its color and size. The new size remains 14 as specified. The potential test output matches these expectations, with the object starting at index 6 and ending at index 19, of color 4, and size 14. It seems that the transformation was correctly applied based on the overall pattern and detailed transformation steps provided.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output has been transformed correctly according to the given transformation steps. The input object of color 4 starts at index 4 and ends at index 17, with a size of 14. According to the transformation steps, the object should be moved 2 places to the right. This means the start index should be now 6 and the end index should be 19, which is observed in the test output. The size of the object remains the same at 14, which is also in line with the transformation steps that specify the size and color of the object should be retained.
