According to the transformation steps, these two objects should be merged into a single object spanning from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object. In this test case, the first object starts at index 5 and the second object ends at index 14. Therefore, the merged object should start at index 5 and end at index 14. The size of the new object is calculated by taking the end index of the second object minus the start index of the first object plus one (14 - 5 + 1), which equals 10. The transformed object in the test output is {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 10}, which matches the expected result.
