You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation seems to apply when there are two or more objects of the same color. The distance between objects of the same color does not seem to matter.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color. If there is more than one object of the same color, merge them into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object, filling all intermediate indices with the same color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, find the minimum start_index and the maximum end_index.', 'Create a new object with the color of the group, starting at the minimum start_index and ending at the maximum end_index found. The size of the new object is the difference between the end_index and start_index plus one.', 'Replace the original objects in the group with the new object, filling all positions between the start_index and end_index with the color of the objects.', 'Leave all other pixels at their initial values (either 0 or a different color that is not part of the group).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 18],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 14}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation seems to apply when there are two or more objects of the same color. The distance between objects of the same color does not seem to matter.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color. If there is more than one object of the same color, merge them into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object, filling all intermediate indices with the same color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, find the minimum start_index and the maximum end_index.', 'Create a new object with the color of the group, starting at the minimum start_index and ending at the maximum end_index found. The size of the new object is the difference between the end_index and start_index plus one.', 'Replace the original objects in the group with the new object, filling all positions between the start_index and end_index with the color of the objects.', 'Leave all other pixels at their initial values (either 0 or a different color that is not part of the group).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 18],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 18]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output appears to have been transformed correctly according to the given transformation steps. The input sequence had two objects of the same color (1), with Object_1 starting at index 12 and ending at index 12, and Object_2 starting at index 16 and ending at index 16. Following the steps, these two objects are grouped together by color, and a new object is created with the same color (1), starting at the minimum start_index of Object_1 (12) and ending at the maximum end_index of Object_2 (16). The size of the new object is the difference between the end_index (16) and the start_index (12) plus one, which is 5. The output object matches this description exactly, indicating a correct transformation.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly follows the transformation steps. The original input had two objects of the same color (color 1), with the first object starting at index 12 and ending at index 12 (size 1), and the second object starting at index 16 and ending at index 16 (size 1). According to the transformation steps, these two objects should be merged into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object. In the test output, the objects were correctly merged into a single object with color 1, starting at index 12 and ending at index 16, resulting in a size of 5 (16 - 12 + 1). This matches the expected transformation according to the provided pattern and steps.", "value": 10}
