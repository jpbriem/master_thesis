You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:

transformation steps: ['Recolor the first object to the color value of the second object.', 'Move the first object to the position where the second object is currently located, adjusting all pixels in between as necessary to reflect this movement.', 'Move the second object to the right by a number of positions equal to the size of the first object, ensuring not to overlap with any existing objects or extend beyond the sequence bounds.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change colors with each other and move to the right. The smaller object always moves by a number of positions equal to its size, while the larger object moves by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start position to the start position of the smaller object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify the two objects. Swap their colors. Move the smaller object to the right by a number of positions equal to its size. Move the larger object to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start to the start of the smaller object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Move the smaller object (size 1) to the right by a number of positions equal to its size (1 position).', 'Calculate the original distance from the start position of the larger object to the start position of the smaller object.', 'Move the larger object to the right by a number of positions equal to the calculated distance.', 'Ensure that the rest of the sequence remains filled with the background color, represented by 0.']

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 8}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 8}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change colors with each other and move to the right. The smaller object always moves by a number of positions equal to its size, while the larger object moves by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start position to the start position of the smaller object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify the two objects. Swap their colors. Move the smaller object to the right by a number of positions equal to its size. Move the larger object to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start to the start of the smaller object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Move the smaller object (size 1) to the right by a number of positions equal to its size (1 position).', 'Calculate the original distance from the start position of the larger object to the start position of the smaller object.', 'Move the larger object to the right by a number of positions equal to the calculated distance.', 'Ensure that the rest of the sequence remains filled with the background color, represented by 0.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has incorrectly transformed the input sequence. The sizes of the objects post-transformation are correct, but their positions have been mishandled. According to the transformation rules, the smaller object (size 1) should move to the right by 1 position, starting from its original position index 10, which would place it at index 11. This part is correctly applied in the output. However, the larger object (size 9) should move to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from its original start position to the start of the smaller object, which is 10 - 0 = 10 positions. Therefore, the larger object should start at index 0 + 10 = 10. But in the test output, the larger object starts at index 10, overlapping the new position of the smaller object, and ends at index 19, which is incorrect. The larger object should start at index 10 and end at index 18 to maintain its size of 9. Additionally, there is a logical error, as the smaller object is shown to have moved by more than 1 position, and the larger object has shifted to start where the smaller object should be. The correct transformed positions should be: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}.",
