The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects at the start of the sequence that are large are moved to the right, while small objects at the end remain unchanged\noverall pattern: If an object occupies the beginning of the sequence and is larger than a certain size, move the object towards the right without changing its color or size.

Object_1, which starts at index 2 and has a size of 8, is moved to the right by 5 indices to start at index 7 and end at index 14, without altering its size or color, as per the overall pattern. This movement aligns with the observed behavior in the examples where larger objects at the start are moved towards the right by 4 indices, but in this case, the movement is by 5 indices, which is not consistent with the examples given. Object_2 remains unchanged, meeting the condition for small objects at the end of the sequence. The background is correctly filled with 0 where Object_1 was originally placed. However, since the movement of Object_1 does not match the pattern shown in the examples (it moved by 5 instead of 4), the transformation is slightly off.\",\n    \"value\": \"7\"\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"In the test case, we are given an input sequence with two objects. According to the examples, larger objects at the start of the sequence are moved to the right, while small objects at the end remain unchanged. The transformation steps include identifying objects, checking their sizes, moving large objects to the right without changing their size or color, ensuring no overlap with small objects at the end, and leaving small objects unchanged. For Object_1 in the test case input, it starts at index 2 and ends at index 9 with a size of 8, which qualifies as a large object at the start of the sequence. The transformation correctly moves Object_1 to the right; it now starts at index 7 and ends at index 14, maintaining its size of 8 and color 7. Object_2 is a small object at the end of the sequence and remains unchanged, starting and ending at index 15 with a size of 1 and color 2. The spaces left by the movement of Object_1 are filled with the background color as required. Given that the transformation adheres to the provided examples and overall pattern, and all steps seem to be correctly applied, the test output appears to be correct.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
