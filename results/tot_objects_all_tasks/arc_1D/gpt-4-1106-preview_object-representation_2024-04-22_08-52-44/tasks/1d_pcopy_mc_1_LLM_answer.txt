You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The change occurs to objects of size 1 irrespective of their color or initial position. No other objects are altered.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of size 1 and scale them to size 3. The central pixel of the scaled object should be the original pixel, thus the new start index is the original start index minus one, and the end index is the original start index plus one. Maintain the original color of the object.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The change occurs to objects of size 1 irrespective of their color or initial position. No other objects are altered.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of size 1 and scale them to size 3. The central pixel of the scaled object should be the original pixel, thus the new start index is the original start index minus one, and the end index is the original start index plus one. Maintain the original color of the object.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the sequence with size 1.', 'For each identified object, calculate the new start index by subtracting 1 from the original start index of the object.', 'Calculate the new end index by adding 1 to the original start index of the object.', 'Replace the single pixel of the object with three pixels of the same color, using the new start and end indices determined in the previous steps.', 'Leave objects with size greater than 1 unchanged.', "Ensure that the sequence's dimension remains the same."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern affects objects of size 1, where each object is scaled to size 3 and moved one position to the left.
overall pattern: For any input, objects of size greater than 1 remain unchanged. Objects of size 1 are transformed by increasing their size to 3 and moving their start_index and end_index one position to the left. This rule applies to all objects of size 1, irrespective of their color or initial position.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1, move the start_index one position to the left.', 'Adjust the end_index to be two positions to the right of the new start_index, resulting in a size of 3 for the object.', 'Keep the color of the object the same.', 'Leave objects of size greater than 1 at their original positions and sizes.', 'Apply these steps to all objects of size 1 in the sequence to achieve the output.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.
