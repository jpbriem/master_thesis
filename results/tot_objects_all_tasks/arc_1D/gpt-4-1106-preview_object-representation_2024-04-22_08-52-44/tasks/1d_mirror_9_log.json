The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}.

The first object takes the color of the second object and moves to its original position. The second object takes the original color of the first object and moves to the right side of the first object's original position, separated by a gap of 2 background pixels.\noverall pattern: For any input: Exchange the colors of the first and second objects.

The colors of the objects were swapped correctly, with Object_1 taking the color of Object_2 (color 9) and Object_2 taking the color of Object_1 (color 2). However, the position of Object_1 in the test output is incorrect. According to the transformation pattern, Object_1 should have moved to the position where Object_2 was originally located, which is starting at index 9. However, the output shows Object_1 starting at index 9 which is correct but ending at index 13, which is incorrect as its size should have remained 5, so it should have ended at index 13. Furthermore, Object_2 was supposed to be moved to the right of the original position of Object_1, with a gap of 2 background pixels. This means Object_2 should have started at index 8 (original end index of Object_1 is 5, plus 2 background pixels, equals start index 8), but the output shows Object_2 starting at index 7, which is incorrect. Additionally, the size of Object_2 is correct, but its position is not aligned with the transformation pattern.\",\n  \"value\": 4\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output does not follow the overall transformation pattern correctly. The transformation steps state that the first object should move to the second object's original position with a color swap, and the second object should move to the right of the first object's original position with a gap of two background pixels, also with a color swap. In the test output, the first object (with color 2) should have become color 9 and moved to the position where the second object was originally located (start_index: 9), which is correct. However, the end_index of the first object should have been 9, not 13, since the size should remain unchanged and is given as 1. The second object (with color 9) should have moved to the right of the first object's original position, starting at index 8 (original end_index of the first object plus 2 for the background pixels), but instead, it is incorrectly placed at start_index: 7. Furthermore, the size of the second object is correct, but the placement is wrong. Based on the given pattern, the correct output for the second object should have been {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 5}. Therefore, the object positions and sizes in the test output are incorrect according to the transformation steps.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}"
