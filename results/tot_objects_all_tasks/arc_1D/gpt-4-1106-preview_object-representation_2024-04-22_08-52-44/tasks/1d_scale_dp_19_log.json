The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

In this example, the first object increased from a size of 3 to 5, stopping before the second object, which supports the pattern.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is not precise enough as it does not specify how much the first object should expand.

The first object expands to cover up to the index before the last object.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern lacks precision because it does not explain whether the first object should always expand just before the last object or if it should stop at the second to last index of the entire sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 6\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions correctly refer to the input sequence and are relevant for determining the changes to the objects.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation from input to output for this example, where the first object's size is expanded to the second to last index before the final object, and the final object remains unchanged.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides clear instructions on how to modify the first object and indicates that the last object should remain the same.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are still relevant to the input sequence and necessary for determining the changes to the objects.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern remains valid for this example.
