You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition for the transformation is the presence of an object with at least two different color pixels.
overall pattern: For every object, if the first and last color pixel are different, move the first color pixel to the last position. The object retains the same size and position, but its color sequence is altered by this swap.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9]], 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9]], 'size': 10}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12]], 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12]], 'size': 7}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15]], 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4], 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15]], 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition for the transformation is the presence of an object with at least two different color pixels.
overall pattern: For every object, if the first and last color pixel are different, move the first color pixel to the last position. The object retains the same size and position, but its color sequence is altered by this swap.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the first and last pixel have different colors.', 'If they have different colors, swap the color values of the first and last pixel.', 'Leave the rest of the pixels within the object unchanged.', 'Retain the original size and position of the object in the sequence.', 'Output the transformed sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16]], 'size': 7}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 20]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16]], 'size': 7}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps have been correctly applied to the test input. The object in question has a size of 7 with different color values at the first and last position of the sequence. According to the transformation pattern, the first and last color pixels should be swapped if they are different. In the given test case, the first pixel color is 2, and the last pixel color is 5, which are different. The test output reflects the correct swap of these colors (first color pixel moved to the last position and vice versa), and the rest of the pixels within the object remain unchanged. The object retains the original size and position in the sequence as specified by the transformation steps.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly identifies the input object and assesses that it has at least two different color pixels, satisfying the condition. The transformation swaps the first and last color pixels of the object, as per the overall pattern described. The size and position of the object remain unchanged, and the rest of the pixels within the object are left untouched. The transformation steps have been followed accurately.", "value": 10}
