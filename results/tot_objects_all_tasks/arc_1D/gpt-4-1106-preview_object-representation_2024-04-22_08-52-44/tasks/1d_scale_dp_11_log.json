The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

In this test case, Object_1 should be scaled to the index just before Object_2, which starts at index 22. Therefore, the end index of Object_1 after transformation should indeed be 21, making its size 22, which matches the provided test output. Object_2 remains unchanged as it does not meet another object or the end of the sequence, which is consistent with the transformation rules.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test input consists of two objects: Object_1 with color 5 ranging from index 0 to 19 and Object_2 with color 9 at index 22.

Since the next object (Object_2) starts at index 22 and the sequence ends at index 23, Object_1 should be scaled to index 21, which is the position right before Object_2 begins.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 21}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects are scaled until they encounter another object or the end of the sequence. The presence of another object, regardless of color, prevents further scaling. The scaling direction is towards the closest end of the sequence or the next object, whichever is closer.\noverall pattern: The general rule to transform any input into its output is to identify objects and scale the first object encountered in the sequence until it either reaches another object or the end of the sequence. The object retains its original color and starting position, and only its size and end position change. Objects that do not meet another object or the end of the sequence remain unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the sequence of objects within the input.', 'For each object, determine the direction of scaling based on its position relative to the end of the sequence and other objects.', 'Scale the first object by extending it towards the closest boundary (another object or end of the sequence) without altering its color or starting index.', 'Continue the scaling process until the object reaches either another object or the end of the sequence, which stops the scaling.', 'Leave subsequent objects unchanged if they do not meet another object or the end of the sequence.', 'Repeat the process for each object in the sequence.', 'The output sequence should reflect the scaled size and end index for each object while maintaining the original colors and starting indices.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 20}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 24]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 22}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output seems to have applied the transformation steps correctly, following the overall pattern described.

Given that the next object 'Object_2' starts at index 22, 'Object_1' should scale up to the index right before 22, which is index 21, resulting in a new size of 22.
