You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

There is no indication that the new indices exceed the dimension of the sequence, so no truncation is needed. The background color (0) should fill the positions that were originally occupied by the object, which we assume has been done correctly as there is no explicit sequence to verify. Based on the provided information, the transformation appears to be accurate.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "According to the examples and the overall pattern described, each object in the input sequence is expected to move 2 positions to the right without altering their color or size. The transformation steps provided outline the process to achieve this, including identifying objects, incrementing their start and end indices, ensuring they remain within the sequence dimensions, moving them in the output sequence, and filling the original positions with the background color. For the provided test case, the input object starts from index 11 and ends at index 13 with a size of 3. After applying the transformation, the object's start index should be incremented by 2 to 13, and the end index should also increment by 2 to 15, which matches the provided output. The size remains the same, which is correct. The output does not violate the sequence dimensions and adheres to the described pattern and transformation steps. Therefore, the transformation for the test case has been correctly applied.",

Value Prompt:

system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 9}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 11}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: all objects move 2 positions to the right regardless of their color or size
overall pattern: for any input, move each object 2 positions to the right without altering their color or size


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by scanning for non-zero values that are adjacent.', "For each identified object, increment the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 2 to move the object to the right.", 'Ensure that the incremented indices do not exceed the dimensions of the input sequence.', 'In the output sequence, place each object at its new position according to the updated indices.', 'Maintain the original color and size of each object during the transformation.', "Fill the positions that were originally occupied by the objects with the background color (0) until the new 'start_index'.", 'If the movement of an object causes it to exceed the dimensions of the sequence, truncate the object to fit within the dimensions.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}
