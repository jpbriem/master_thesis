The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change?

However, in the test output, Object_1 is incorrectly placed starting at index 4 and ending at index 6, which gives it a size of 3, but it should only occupy indexes 4 and 5, maintaining the size of 2 as per the original object size. Object_2 is shown to start and end at index 6, which is correct for its new position but incorrect in size; it should maintain the original size of 1, but the output indicates a size of 3.

The first object's color should be swapped with the second object's color, which has been done correctly (7 with 9). However, the placement of the objects after the swap is incorrect. According to the pattern, the first object should be placed at the starting index of the second object, which is index 4. However, the transformed first object starts at index 4 but incorrectly extends to index 6, meaning its size was also increased incorrectly to 3, creating an overlap with the second object. Additionally, the second object should be moved two positions to the right from its original starting index (which would be from index 4 to index 6), but it is placed at index 6, where it should have started at index 6 and end at index 6, maintaining its size of 1. The correct transformed objects should be: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}.
