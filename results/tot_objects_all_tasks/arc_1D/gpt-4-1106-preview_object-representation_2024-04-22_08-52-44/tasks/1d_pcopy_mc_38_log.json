The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4 each had an original size of 1 and were correctly expanded to a size of 3 while maintaining their original colors. The start indices for these objects were also correctly shifted one place to the left, from 8 to 7 for Object_2, from 12 to 11 for Object_3, and from 17 to 16 for Object_4. The end indices were adjusted correctly to reflect the new size of 3, with Object_2 ending at index 9, Object_3 ending at index 13, and Object_4 ending at index 18. Object_1, which already had a size greater than 1, remains unchanged, which is also consistent with the overall pattern and transformation steps.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
