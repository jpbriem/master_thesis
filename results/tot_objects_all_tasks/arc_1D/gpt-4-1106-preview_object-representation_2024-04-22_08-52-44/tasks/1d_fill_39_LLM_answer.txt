You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern is that objects of the same color that are separate in the input sequence merge into a single object in the output sequence. The size of the resulting object is determined by the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object of that color
overall pattern: For any input with objects of the same color, the objects will transform into a single object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the last object of that color. All intermediary pixels between these two indices will be colored with that color, resulting in a larger, single object



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence with the same color.', 'Determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object of that color.', "Color all pixels between and including these indices with the object's color to create a single, larger object in the output sequence.", 'Remove any separate objects of that color that were in the input sequence as they are now part of the larger object.', 'Repeat the above steps for each color with more than one object in the input sequence.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: if there are objects of the same color, they merge into a single object
overall pattern: for objects of the same color, create a single object that starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the last object, filling all positions in between

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

All intermediary pixels between these two indices will be colored with that color, resulting in a larger, single object


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence with the same color.', 'Determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object of that color.', "Color all pixels between and including these indices with the object's color to create a single, larger object in the output sequence.", 'Remove any separate objects of that color that were in the input sequence as they are now part of the larger object.', 'Repeat the above steps for each color with more than one object in the input sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: if there are objects of the same color, they merge into a single object
overall pattern: for objects of the same color, create a single object that starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the last object, filling all positions in between


transformation steps: ['Identify all distinct objects in the input sequence', 'Check if any objects share the same color', 'For objects with the same color, determine the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the last object', 'Create a new object with the same color that spans from the identified start_index to the identified end_index', 'Fill all positions between the start_index and end_index with the color of the merged objects', 'Replace the original objects with the newly created merged object in the output sequence', 'Maintain the background color (0) in all positions not covered by the new object']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 16]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 11}
