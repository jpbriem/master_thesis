You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change is that there is an even number of objects of the same color, and they are paired sequentially.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, pair every two consecutive objects of the same color. The new object will have the color of the original objects, the start index of the first object in the pair, and the end index of the second.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and there is an even number of them. Only consecutive pairs of objects are considered for merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of consecutive objects of the same color. Merge each pair into a single object, where the new object's start_index is the start_index of the first object, the end_index is the end_index of the second object, and the size is recalculated based on the new start and end indices. This merging process occurs for all pairs of consecutive objects of the same color.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change is that there is an even number of objects of the same color, and they are paired sequentially.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, pair every two consecutive objects of the same color. The new object will have the color of the original objects, the start index of the first object in the pair, and the end index of the second. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the distance between them. This transformation is applied only when there is an even number of objects of the same color.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence, noting their color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Check if the number of objects for each color is even. If not, the transformation does not apply to those objects.', 'For each color with an even number of objects, pair the objects sequentially, taking the first and second object as a pair, then the third and fourth, and so on.', 'For each pair of objects, create a new object with the following characteristics:', '  - The color of the new object is the same as the color of the original objects in the pair.', '  - The start index of the new object is the same as the start index of the first object in the pair.', '  - The end index of the new object is the same as the end index of the second object in the pair.', '  - The size of the new object is calculated as the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance (number of background pixels) between them.', 'Remove the original objects that have been paired and replaced by the new objects.', 'The sequence is updated to reflect the new objects and the removal of the original paired objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change is that there is an even number of objects of the same color, and they are paired sequentially.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, pair every two consecutive objects of the same color. The new object will have the color of the original objects, the start index of the first object in the pair, and the end index of the second. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the distance between them. This transformation is applied only when there is an even number of objects of the same color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence, noting their color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Check if the number of objects for each color is even. If not, the transformation does not apply to those objects.', 'For each color with an even number of objects, pair the objects sequentially, taking the first and second object as a pair, then the third and fourth, and so on.', 'For each pair of objects, create a new object with the following characteristics:', '  - The color of the new object is the same as the color of the original objects in the pair.', '  - The start index of the new object is the same as the start index of the first object in the pair.', '  - The end index of the new object is the same as the end index of the second object in the pair.', '  - The size of the new object is calculated as the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance (number of background pixels) between them.', 'Remove the original objects that have been paired and replaced by the new objects.', 'The sequence is updated to reflect the new objects and the removal of the original paired objects.']

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and there is an even number of them. Only consecutive pairs of objects are considered for merging.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of consecutive objects of the same color. Merge each pair into a single object, where the new object's start_index is the start_index of the first object, the end_index is the end_index of the second object, and the size is recalculated based on the new start and end indices. This merging process occurs for all pairs of consecutive objects of the same color.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and identify all objects.', 'Group objects by color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, check if the number of objects is even.', 'If the number of objects is even, proceed to merge objects; otherwise, leave them as they are.', 'Within each color group with an even number of objects, pair up consecutive objects (Object_1 with Object_2, Object_3 with Object_4, and so on).', 'For each pair, create a new object with the following properties:', 'The color of the new object remains the same as the original objects.', 'The start_index of the new object is the start_index of the first object in the pair.', 'The end_index of the new object is the end_index of the second object in the pair.', 'The size of the new object is calculated as the difference between the new end_index and start_index plus one.', 'Replace the original pairs of objects with the newly created merged objects in the output sequence.', 'Fill in the gaps between the merged objects with the background color (0).', 'Ensure that the output sequence has the same dimension as the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 87],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 55, 'end_index': 55, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 60, 'end_index': 60, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 84, 'end_index': 84, 'size': 1}

transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.
