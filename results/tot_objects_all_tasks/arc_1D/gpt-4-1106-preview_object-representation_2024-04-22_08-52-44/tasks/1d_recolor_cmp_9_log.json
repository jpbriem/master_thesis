The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
