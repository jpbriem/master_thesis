You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Example_2:

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The change occurs for every pair of objects of the same color that are separated by a consistent number of background pixels. The distance between objects before merging appears to be consistently one less than the final size of the merged object.
overall pattern: Identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a certain number of background pixels. Merge each identified pair into a single object, with the start index of the first and the end index of the second, such that the size of the new object is equal to the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that separated them.



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Determine the color of each object.', 'Identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by the specific number of background pixels (one less than the final size of the merged object).', 'For each identified pair, merge the objects by creating a new object with the following properties:', "  - The 'color' should be the same as the original objects.", "  - The 'start_index' should be the start index of the first object in the pair.", "  - The 'end_index' should be the end index of the second object in the pair.", "  - The 'size' should be the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that separated them.", 'Remove the original objects that have been merged from the sequence.', 'Insert the new merged object into the sequence at the position of the first object from the pair.', 'Repeat the merge process for all identified pairs.', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'If there are any remaining objects that did not merge, they should remain unchanged in the output sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are merged if they are of the same color and separated by exactly two background pixels (0s)
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have exactly two background pixels between them. Merge each pair into a single object where the new size is the sum of the individual sizes plus two (for the background pixels), the color remains unchanged, and the new start and end indices are those of the first and second object respectively in each pair


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence', 'Check for pairs of objects that have the same color', 'For each pair, verify that there are exactly two background pixels separating them', 'Merge each qualified pair into a single object by doing the following:', '  - The color of the new object remains the same as the original objects', '  - The start_index of the new object is the same as the start_index of the first object in the pair', '  - The end_index of the new object is the same as the end_index of the second object in the pair', '  - The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of both objects plus two (to include the background pixels)', 'Remove the original objects from the sequence, replacing them with the new merged object', 'Repeat this process for all pairs of objects that meet the conditions', 'Output the transformed sequence with the newly merged objects']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The change occurs for every pair of objects of the same color that are separated by a consistent number of background pixels. The distance between objects before merging appears to be consistently one less than the final size of the merged object.
overall pattern: Identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a certain number of background pixels. Merge each identified pair into a single object, with the start index of the first and the end index of the second, such that the size of the new object is equal to the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that separated them.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Determine the color of each object.', 'Identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by the specific number of background pixels (one less than the final size of the merged object).', 'For each identified pair, merge the objects by creating a new object with the following properties:', "  - The 'color' should be the same as the original objects.", "  - The 'start_index' should be the start index of the first object in the pair.", "  - The 'end_index' should be the end index of the second object in the pair.", "  - The 'size' should be the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that separated them.", 'Remove the original objects that have been merged from the sequence.', 'Insert the new merged object into the sequence at the position of the first object from the pair.', 'Repeat the merge process for all identified pairs.', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'If there are any remaining objects that did not merge, they should remain unchanged in the output sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
