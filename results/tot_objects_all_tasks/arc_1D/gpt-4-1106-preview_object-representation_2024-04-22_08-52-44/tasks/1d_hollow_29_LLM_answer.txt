You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their start and end indices, regardless of their size or color. Each object is split into two smaller objects of size 1 at the original start and end indices.
overall pattern: For any input, identify each object, then transform it into two objects with the same color but of size 1, positioned at the original start index and end index of the original object



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object in the input sequence, note its color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Remove all pixels of the object except for those at the start_index and end_index.', 'Set the size of the resulting objects at start_index and end_index to 1.', 'Ensure the color of the new objects at start_index and end_index remains the same as the original object.', 'All other pixels in the sequence that do not correspond to the start_index and end_index of objects become background color (0).']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 8}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to any single contiguous object. The transformation is not dependent on specific colors, positions within the sequence, or the size of the object
overall pattern: For any contiguous object in the input, transform it by hollowing out all but the first and last pixels, effectively reducing its size to 1 pixel at the original start and end indices, and maintaining the original color



transformation steps: ['Identify the contiguous object within the input sequence by finding the start and end indices of the sequence of non-zero values.', 'Retain the first pixel of the object at its original start index, keeping its original color.', 'Retain the last pixel of the object at its original end index, maintaining its original color.', 'Replace all other pixels of the object with the background color (0) to hollow out the object.', 'Leave all other pixels that are already background color (0) unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to any single contiguous object. The transformation is not dependent on specific colors, positions within the sequence, or the size of the object
overall pattern: For any contiguous object in the input, transform it by hollowing out all but the first and last pixels, effectively reducing its size to 1 pixel at the original start and end indices, and maintaining the original color


transformation steps: ['Identify the contiguous object within the input sequence by finding the start and end indices of the sequence of non-zero values.', 'Retain the first pixel of the object at its original start index, keeping its original color.', 'Retain the last pixel of the object at its original end index, maintaining its original color.', 'Replace all other pixels of the object with the background color (0) to hollow out the object.', 'Leave all other pixels that are already background color (0) unchanged.']

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object in the input sequence, note its color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Remove all pixels of the object except for those at the start_index and end_index.', 'Set the size of the resulting objects at start_index and end_index to 1.', 'Ensure the color of the new objects at start_index and end_index remains the same as the original object.', 'All other pixels in the sequence that do not correspond to the start_index and end_index of objects become background color (0).']

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The test output matches this description, showing two objects with color 2, each of size 1, located at the original starting index 1 and the original ending index 7. This is exactly in accordance with the described transformation steps and overall pattern. Therefore, we can conclude that the test input was correctly transformed into the test output.", "value": 10}

{"test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation instructions accurately. The input object of color 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 7, was correctly transformed into an output with two objects of the same color. The first object remains at the start index 1 with a size of 1, and the second object is positioned at the end index 7 with a size of 1. All other pixels between these indices were replaced by the background color (0), hollowing out the object. This transformation adheres to the overall pattern described, which applies to any single contiguous object regardless of its specific attributes. The output maintains the original color and positions for the first and last pixels of the object, with all other pixels turned to the background color, which matches the given conditions and transformation steps.", "value": 10}
