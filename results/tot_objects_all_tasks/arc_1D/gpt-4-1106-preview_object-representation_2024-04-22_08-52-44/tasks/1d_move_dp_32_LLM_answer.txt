You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Only the largest object in the sequence changes position. The change is a move to the right without altering its size or color

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 26}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 26}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 19}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 19}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Only the largest object in the sequence changes position. The change is a move to the right without altering its size or color
overall pattern: For the largest object, count the number of colors including zeros before its start index, then move it to the right by that many positions. Keep the size and color the same. All other objects remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify the largest object in the input sequence.', 'Count the total number of colors including zeros before the start index of the identified largest object.', 'Move the largest object to the right by the number of positions counted in the previous step.', 'Ensure the size and color of the largest object remain the same after the move.', 'Leave all other objects in their original positions with their original colors and sizes.', 'Output the transformed sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 24}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 30]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 24}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output is incorrect. According to the transformation steps, we should identify the largest object in the input sequence, which is Object_1 with a size of 24. We then count the total number of colors including zeros before the start index of Object_1, which is zero since the object starts at index 0. Therefore, Object_1 should not move. However, the transformation pattern specifies that objects should move to the right by the number of positions counted, which suggests there might be an exception for when an object starts at index 0. The given test output shows no movement for Object_1, which is consistent with the transformation steps but contradicts the overall pattern observed in the examples. According to the overall pattern, Object_1 should have moved 3 positions to the right since there are 3 positions (including zero) before the start of Object_1 in Example_2. The test output does not conform to this pattern.",
  "value": 0
}
------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output did not follow the transformation steps correctly. According to the transformation steps, the largest object, which is Object_1 with size 24, should have been moved to the right by the number of positions equal to the sum of colors and zeros before its start index. Since Object_1 starts at index 0, it should have been moved 0 positions to the right. However, the test output shows that Object_1 remained in its original position, which is correct according to the overall pattern. Therefore, there is no error in the transformation of Object_1. Object_2 also remained in its original position, which is correct as per the steps because it is not the largest object and should remain unchanged. The test output is correct.",
