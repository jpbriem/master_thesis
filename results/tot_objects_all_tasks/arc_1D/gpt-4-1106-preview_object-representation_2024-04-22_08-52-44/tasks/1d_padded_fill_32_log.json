The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

The merged objects in the output have sizes of 23, which is the distance from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object in each pair. However, according to the transformation steps, the size should be calculated by adding the consistent distance plus one to the size of the first object. The consistent distance between the objects is 22 (24-2, 51-29, 78-56), and thus the size of each merged object should be 22+1=23. However, the end_index should be the start_index of the second object in the pair, not the end_index. Therefore, the end_index for each merged object should be one less than the value provided (23, 50, 77 instead of 24, 51, 78).

The distances between the start indices of each pair of adjacent objects (Object_1 to Object_2, Object_3 to Object_4, Object_5 to Object_6) are 22, 22, and 22, respectively, which are consistent across the sequence. The merging has been performed correctly, with the start_index of merged objects being the same as the start_index of the first object in the pair, and the end_index being the start_index of the second object in the pair. The sizes of the merged objects are correctly calculated as 23, which is the sum of the size of the first object (1) and the consistent distance (22) plus one.
