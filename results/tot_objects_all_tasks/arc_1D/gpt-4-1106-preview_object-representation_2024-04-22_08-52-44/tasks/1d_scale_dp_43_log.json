The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The first object consistently expands in size while the second object remains unchanged. The expansion size varies, suggesting it is influenced by the initial size of the object or the available space between the objects.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, expand the size of the first object to occupy any available space up to the start index of the second object, while keeping the second object unchanged.
