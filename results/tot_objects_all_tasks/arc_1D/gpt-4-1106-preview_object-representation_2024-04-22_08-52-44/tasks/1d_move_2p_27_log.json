Each step is as follows: 1. The object is correctly identified in the input sequence. 2. The new start index for Object_1 is calculated by adding 2 to the original start index (1 + 2 = 3), which matches the test output. 3. The new end index is similarly calculated by adding 2 to the original end index (3 + 2 = 5), which is also in line with the test output. 4. The new start and end indices do not exceed the dimension limit of 9, as they are within the range [0, 8] for zero-indexing. 5. The output sequence correctly places the object at its new start index and fills up to its new end index with the object's color. 6. All other positions in the output sequence should be filled with the background color (0), and as there is only one object in the input, the rest of the sequence in the output is presumed to be 0, which is consistent with the transformation rules. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation steps were followed correctly based on the overall pattern provided. The object with color 7 starting from index 1 and ending at index 3 was correctly shifted 2 positions to the right. Its new start index is 3 and the new end index is 5, adhering to the transformation rule without exceeding the dimension limit. The size remains the same at 3 and the other positions in the dimension are assumed to be filled with the background color (0).
