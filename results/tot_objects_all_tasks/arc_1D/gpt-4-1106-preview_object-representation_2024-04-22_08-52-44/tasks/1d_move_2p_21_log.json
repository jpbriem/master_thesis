The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 7}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 6}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 6}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 12}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 12}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Based on all examples, objects change position regardless of their color or size. The consistent condition for change is the rightward movement by 2 spaces.\noverall pattern: The type of object that changes is any object present in the input. The reason why it changes is part of the transformation pattern. How it changes is by moving every object's position 2 spaces to the right, maintaining the original color and size.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence. An object is a sequence of adjacent pixels with the same non-zero value.', 'For each identified object, determine its current start_index and end_index.', 'Move each object 2 spaces to the right. This is done by adding 2 to both the start_index and end_index of each object.', \"Ensure that the object's color remains unchanged during the transformation.\", \"Ensure that the object's size (number of pixels) remains the same after the transformation.\", \"If the object's movement to the right introduces new background pixels on the left, fill these with the background color (0).\", \"If the object's movement to the right causes it to extend beyond the original dimension of the sequence, truncate the object to fit within the original boundaries.\", 'The output sequence should maintain the same dimension as the input sequence.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 7}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 16]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 7}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output has correctly identified and transformed Object_1 by moving it 2 spaces to the right.

The transformation steps have been adhered to, including maintaining the original color and size of the object, and keeping the object within the original dimension boundaries.

However, the object's end_index is 8, which implies the object now spans from index 2 to index 8, which is a total of 7 pixels.
