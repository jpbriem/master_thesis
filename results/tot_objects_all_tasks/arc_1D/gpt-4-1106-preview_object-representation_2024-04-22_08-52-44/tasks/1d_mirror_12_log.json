According to the transformation steps, Object_1 should swap its color with Object_2, which has been done correctly. However, Object_1 should move to the original position of Object_2, which was at start_index 7. The size of Object_1 is 6, so Object_2 should move to the right by 6 positions from its original start_index. This means Object_2 should start at index 7 + 6 = 13. The test output correctly places Object_2 starting at index 13, but incorrectly places Object_1 starting at index 7. Object_1 should have started at index 7 and ended at index 12, but according to the overall pattern, it should have been relocated to start at index 7 and end at index 12, which aligns with the given test output. Thus, the test output placement for Object_1 is correct, but the explanation provided in the analysis contradicts the correct result. The size of the objects is maintained correctly, and the color swap is also correct. The final test output object positions are consistent with the transformation rules.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation steps applied to the test input are as follows: Identify the two objects - Object_1 with color 1 and Object_2 with color 9. Swap the colors of the two objects - Object_1 now has color 9 and Object_2 has color 1. Move the first object (Object_1) to the original position of the second object (Object_2) - Object_1 should now start at index 7. Calculate the size of the first object - the size of Object_1 is 6. Move the second object (Object_2) to the right by a distance equal to the size of the first object - since the size of Object_1 is 6, Object_2 should be moved 6 places to the right of its original position, which should start at index 13. The size of the objects remains unchanged. The test output correctly swapped the colors and moved Object_1 to the start index of Object_2. However, Object_1's end_index should be 7 + 5 = 12, which is correctly reflected in the test output. Object_2 was moved to the right by the size of Object_1, which is 6, so its start_index and end_index should be 7 + 6 = 13, which is also correct. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
