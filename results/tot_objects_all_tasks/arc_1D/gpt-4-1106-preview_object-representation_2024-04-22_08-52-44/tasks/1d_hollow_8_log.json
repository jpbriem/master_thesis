The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 19}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: All objects with size greater than 2 are transformed\noverall pattern: For any object with size greater than 2, keep the first and last pixel of the object and set the pixels in between to the background color\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object, check if the object size is greater than 2.', 'If the object size is greater than 2, proceed to transform the object.', 'Keep the first pixel of the object at its original index and color.', 'Keep the last pixel of the object at its original index and color.', 'Set all pixels in between the first and last pixel of the object to the background color, which is 0.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
