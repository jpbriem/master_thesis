You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and if there is a fixed distance between the start indices of every pair of adjacent objects. This fixed distance is consistent within each example
overall pattern: For every pair of adjacent objects of the same color, merge them into one object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object. The new size is the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the distance between them

overall pattern: for any input, find pairs of objects with a consistent separation distance and merge them into a new object extending from the start index of the first object to the start index of the second object, with the size being the sum of the separation distance plus one

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 48, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 54, 'end_index': 54, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 75, 'end_index': 75, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 22}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 22}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 54, 'end_index': 75, 'size': 22}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 56, 'end_index': 56, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 77, 'end_index': 77, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 22}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 22}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 56, 'end_index': 77, 'size': 22}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 58, 'end_index': 58, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 72, 'end_index': 72, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 15}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 58, 'end_index': 72, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and if there is a fixed distance between the start indices of every pair of adjacent objects. This fixed distance is consistent within each example
overall pattern: For every pair of adjacent objects of the same color, merge them into one object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object. The new size is the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the distance between them



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence that are of the same color.', 'Calculate the distance between the start indices of every pair of adjacent objects of the same color.', 'Check if this distance is consistent for all pairs of adjacent objects of the same color.', 'If the distance is consistent, merge each pair of adjacent objects into a new object by performing the following steps:', "a. The new object's color is the same as the original objects.", "b. The new object's start index is the same as the start index of the first object in the pair.", "c. The new object's end index is the same as the end index of the second object in the pair.", "d. The new object's size is calculated by adding the sizes of the two original objects and the distance between the start index of the first object and the start index of the second object.", 'Repeat the merge process for every pair of adjacent objects of the same color with the consistent distance until all possible objects have been merged.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the newly merged objects.']

overall pattern:
conditions: objects are combined into a larger object if they are separated by a fixed distance, which appears to be a multiple of 7 indices

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_2:

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 81], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 58, 'end_index': 58, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 72, 'end_index': 72, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and if there is a fixed distance between the start indices of every pair of adjacent objects. This fixed distance is consistent within each example
overall pattern: For every pair of adjacent objects of the same color, merge them into one object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object. The new size is the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the distance between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence that are of the same color.', 'Calculate the distance between the start indices of every pair of adjacent objects of the same color.', 'Check if this distance is consistent for all pairs of adjacent objects of the same color.', 'If the distance is consistent, merge each pair of adjacent objects into a new object by performing the following steps:', "a. The new object's color is the same as the original objects.", "b. The new object's start index is the same as the start index of the first object in the pair.", "c. The new object's end index is the same as the end index of the second object in the pair.", "d.

overall pattern:

overall pattern: For every pair of adjacent objects of the same color, merge them into one object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object. The new size is the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the distance between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence that are of the same color.', 'Calculate the distance between the start indices of every pair of adjacent objects of the same color.', 'Check if this distance is consistent for all pairs of adjacent objects of the same color.', 'If the distance is consistent, merge each pair of adjacent objects into a new object by performing the following steps:', "a.

transformation steps: ['Identify objects of the same color in the input sequence', 'Determine the distance between the start index of each object and the start index of the subsequent object of the same color', 'If the distance between the objects is a multiple of 7, merge the objects into a single object', "The new object's color remains the same as the original objects", "The new object's start index is the same as the start index of the first object in the series being combined", "The new object's end index is the same as the end index of the last object in the series being combined", 'The size of the new object is the difference between the new end index and the new start index plus one', 'Remove all original objects that were combined from the sequence', 'Retain all other objects and background pixels in their original positions', "The output sequence's dimension remains the same as the input sequence's dimension"]

Secondly, Object_3 and Object_4 should have been combined since they are 27 indices apart, which is a multiple of 7 (27 = 7 * 3 + 6).

Value Prompt:
#####
system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
