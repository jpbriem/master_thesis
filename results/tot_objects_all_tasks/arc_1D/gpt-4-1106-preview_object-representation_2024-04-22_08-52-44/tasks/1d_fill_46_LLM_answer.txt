You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern: The transformation rule is to merge objects of the same color into one larger object. The merged object starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the last object, effectively filling in the background between them.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects undergo a change when they share the same color and are separated by a background. The transformation merges objects of the same color into one.
overall pattern: The transformation rule is to merge objects of the same color into one larger object. The merged object starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the last object, effectively filling in the background between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify all separate objects in the input sequence', 'Check if there are exactly two objects of the same color', "If there are two objects of the same color, merge them by filling the background pixels between their start_index and end_index with the object's color", 'The start_index of the merged object is the start_index of the first object', 'The end_index of the merged object is the end_index of the second object', 'The size of the merged object is the distance from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object plus one', 'Replace the input sequence with the output sequence containing the merged object']

Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects undergo a change when they share the same color and are separated by a background. The transformation merges objects of the same color into one.
overall pattern: The transformation rule is to merge objects of the same color into one larger object. The merged object starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the last object, effectively filling in the background between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify all separate objects in the input sequence', 'Check if there are exactly two objects of the same color', "If there are two objects of the same color, merge them by filling the background pixels between their start_index and end_index with the object's color", 'The start_index of the merged object is the start_index of the first object', 'The end_index of the merged object is the end_index of the second object', 'The size of the merged object is the distance from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object plus one', 'Replace the input sequence with the output sequence containing the merged object']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.
