You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern relies on the size of the objects. The color changes are determined by the size regardless of their initial color or position in the sequence.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, look at the size of each object: size 1 objects become color 2, size 2 objects become color 1, and size 3 objects become color 6. No changes are made to the position or size of the objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change color based on their size; size 1 changes to color 2, size 2 to color 1, size 3 to color 6
overall pattern: the transformation applies a recoloring rule based on the size of the objects. Objects of size 1 change to color 2, objects of size 2 change to color 1, and objects of size 3 change to color 6



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by detecting groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'For each object, apply the recoloring rule based on its size: If the object size is 1, change its color to 2. If the object size is 2, change its color to 1. If the object size is 3, change its color to 6.', 'Maintain the position of each object in the sequence unchanged.', 'Leave background pixels (color 0) unchanged.', 'The output sequence should reflect the recolored objects in their original positions with the background preserved.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern relies on the size of the objects. The color changes are determined by the size regardless of their initial color or position in the sequence.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, look at the size of each object: size 1 objects become color 2, size 2 objects become color 1, and size 3 objects become color 6. No changes are made to the position or size of the objects.


transformation steps: ['For each object in the sequence, determine its size.', 'If the size of the object is 1, change its color to 2.', 'If the size of the object is 2, change its color to 1.', 'If the size of the object is 3, change its color to 6.', 'Leave the positions of the objects unchanged.', 'Leave the size of the objects unchanged.', 'Apply these rules sequentially from the first object to the last in the input sequence.']


Test case:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change color based on their size; size 1 changes to color 2, size 2 to color 1, size 3 to color 6
