You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation rule applies to the largest object in the sequence, moving it exactly 2 positions to the right. Other objects, especially those with a size of 1, are not affected by the transformation.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the largest object in terms of size and move it 2 positions to the right. Leave all other objects, particularly those with a size of 1, in their original positions without any changes to color or size.


transformation steps: ['Identify the largest object in the input sequence by comparing the size of all objects.', 'Shift the start_index and end_index of the largest object by 2 positions to the right.', 'Ensure that the largest object does not overlap with any other objects after the shift.', 'Keep all other objects, especially those with a size of 1, in their original positions, maintaining their color and size.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation rule applies to the largest object in the sequence, moving it exactly 2 positions to the right. Other objects, especially those with a size of 1, are not affected by the transformation.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the largest object in terms of size and move it 2 positions to the right. Leave all other objects, particularly those with a size of 1, in their original positions without any changes to color or size.


transformation steps: ['Identify the largest object in the input sequence by comparing the size of all objects.', 'Shift the start_index and end_index of the largest object by 2 positions to the right.', 'Ensure that the largest object does not overlap with any other objects after the shift.', 'Keep all other objects, especially those with a size of 1, in their original positions, maintaining their color and size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.
