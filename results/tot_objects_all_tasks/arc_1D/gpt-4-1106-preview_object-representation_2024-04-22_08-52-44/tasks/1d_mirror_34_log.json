The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

However, the size of the first object after the transformation has changed from the original size of 3 to a size of 3, which is a discrepancy as the size should remain unchanged. The second object, which was originally of size 1 and color 9, has been moved two indices to the right, which is correct, but its color has been changed to 2, which is also correct. The size of the second object post-transformation is 1, which is consistent with the transformation rule. The positions of the objects have been adjusted to ensure there is no overlap and they do not exceed the sequence boundary. The gaps left by the movement of the second object have been filled with the background color (color 0). The output dimension is maintained at [1, 12], which is correct. Overall, the transformation follows the pattern correctly but fails to maintain the size of the first object.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output has errors. The transformation steps were not correctly followed. According to the transformation pattern, the colors of the two objects should have been swapped since the second object has color 9. This step was performed correctly, as the first object's color changed to 9 and the second object's color changed to 2. However, the size of the first object should have been maintained, which was not the case. The size has been incorrectly listed as 3 in the output, instead of the correct size which should be 3 (size from the input). Additionally, the second object should have been moved two indices to the right from its original position, which would have resulted in a start index of 8 and an end index of 8, which was done correctly. However, since the first object's size was erroneously listed as 3, the output is not consistent with the given pattern. Furthermore, filling the gaps after moving the second object seems to have been done correctly as the background color 0 would have been used to fill the spaces from indices 5 to 7, which is consistent with the correct size of the first object being 3. Finally, the output maintains the original dimension of [1, 12], which is correct.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}"
