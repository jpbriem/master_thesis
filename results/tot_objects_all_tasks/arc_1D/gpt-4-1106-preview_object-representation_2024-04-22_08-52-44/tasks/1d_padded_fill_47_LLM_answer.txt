You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color are merged if they are separated by a specific distance of empty pixels, distance depends on the size increase from input to output
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, find pairs of objects with the same color that have a specific number of background pixels between them (two for a size increase of 3, three for a size increase of 4). Merge these pairs into a single object extending from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object, updating the size accordingly

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: input objects merge into a single object in the output if they are separated by a specific number of pixels; this number is consistent within each example
overall pattern: input objects of the same color that have a separation of n pixels between their end index and the start index of the next object of the same color merge into a single object in the output. The size of the resulting object is the combined size of the merged objects plus n



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Check the separation between adjacent objects of the same color; this separation is the number of background pixels (0) between them.', 'If the separation is consistent among all objects of the same color, proceed to merge the objects.', 'Create a new object in the output sequence with the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object to be merged.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by adding the sizes of all merged objects plus the total number of pixels in the separation(s) between them.', 'Set the color of the new object to the same color as the merged input objects.', 'Repeat the process for all groups of objects that can be merged according to the separation rule.', 'Leave all background pixels (0) unchanged unless they are part of the separation between objects being merged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: when objects of the same color are adjacent in the sequence with exactly two zeros in between, they are merged into a new object with a size increased by the number of zeros plus one
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify sequences of objects with the same color that have exactly two zeros in between and merge them into a single object by extending the size to cover the zeros, with the start_index as the start_index of the first object and the end_index as the end_index of the last object plus the number of zeros


transformation steps: ['Iterate over the input sequence to identify all objects', 'Check for sequences of objects that have the same color', 'For each sequence of objects with the same color, count the number of zeros between adjacent objects', 'If exactly two zeros are found between two objects of the same color, proceed to merge', 'Create a new object with the following properties:', ' - The color remains the same as the original objects', ' - The start_index is the start_index of the first object in the sequence', ' - The end_index is the end_index of the last object in the sequence plus the number of zeros (which is two)', ' - The size is the sum of the sizes of all objects being merged plus the number of zeros (which is two)', 'Replace the original objects and zeros in the sequence with the new merged object', 'Repeat the merging process for all eligible sequences of objects within the input', 'Output the transformed sequence as the final result']

overall pattern: input objects of the same color that have a separation of n pixels between their end index and the start index of the next object of the same color merge into a single object in the output. The size of the resulting object is the combined size of the merged objects plus n


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Check the separation between adjacent objects of the same color; this separation is the number of background pixels (0) between them.', 'If the separation is consistent among all objects of the same color, proceed to merge the objects.', 'Create a new object in the output sequence with the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object to be merged.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by adding the sizes of all merged objects plus the total number of pixels in the separation(s) between them.', 'Set the color of the new object to the same color as the merged input objects.', 'Repeat the process for all groups of objects that can be merged according to the separation rule.', 'Leave all background pixels (0) unchanged unless they are part of the separation between objects being merged.']

overall pattern:
conditions: input objects merge into a single object in the output if they are separated by a specific number of pixels; this number is consistent within each example
overall pattern: input objects of the same color that have a separation of n pixels between their end index and the start index of the next object of the same color merge into a single object in the output. The size of the resulting object is the combined size of the merged objects plus n


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Check the separation between adjacent objects of the same color; this separation is the number of background pixels (0) between them.', 'If the separation is consistent among all objects of the same color, proceed to merge the objects.', 'Create a new object in the output sequence with the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object to be merged.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by adding the sizes of all merged objects plus the total number of pixels in the separation(s) between them.', 'Set the color of the new object to the same color as the merged input objects.', 'Repeat the process for all groups of objects that can be merged according to the separation rule.', 'Leave all background pixels (0) unchanged unless they are part of the separation between objects being merged.']


Test case:
