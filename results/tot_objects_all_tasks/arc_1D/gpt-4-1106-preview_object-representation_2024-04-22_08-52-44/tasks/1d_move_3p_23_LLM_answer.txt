You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are shifted to the right by three positions regardless of their color, size, or original position
overall pattern: For any input, shift each object to the right by three positions while maintaining its original color and size


transformation steps: ['1. Identify objects in the input sequence by detecting adjacent pixels of the same color.', '2. For each object, determine its color, size, and current start and end indices.', '3. Shift the start index and the end index of each object to the right by three positions.', '4. Maintain the original color and size of each object during the shift.', "5. Fill in the new positions in the output sequence with the object's color, ensuring that the object's size remains the same.", '6. Replace the positions where the object was originally located with the background color (0) if they fall outside the boundary of the new shifted position.', '7. If the shift causes the object to exceed the boundary of the sequence, truncate the object to fit within the sequence boundaries.', '8. Ensure that the output sequence has the same dimension as the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 11],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 11]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input sequence is [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0] given the object details provided. Following the transformation steps: 1) Object identification is correct, there is one object of color 3 and size 5. 2) The color, size, and indices have been correctly noted. 3) The object's start index has been shifted to the right by three positions from 2 to 5, and the end index has been shifted from 6 to 9. 4) The color and size of the object have been maintained during the shift. 5) The new positions are correctly filled with the object's color. 6) The original object's positions have been correctly replaced by the background color. 7) The shift does not cause the object to exceed the boundaries of the sequence, so no truncation is needed. 8) The output sequence dimension is the same as the input sequence. The transformation has been applied correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation steps correctly. Step 1 correctly identifies the object in the input sequence. Step 2 correctly determines its color (3), size (5), and current start (2) and end indices (6). Step 3 shifts the start and end indices to the right by three positions, resulting in new indices of 5 and 9, respectively. Step 4 maintains the original color of the object. Step 5 ensures the object's size remains the same in the output sequence. Step 6 is not applicable as there are no positions where the object was originally located that fall outside the boundary of the new shifted position. Step 7 is also not necessary as the shift does not cause the object to exceed the boundary of the sequence. Step 8 is adhered to, as the output sequence has the same dimension as the input sequence. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.",
