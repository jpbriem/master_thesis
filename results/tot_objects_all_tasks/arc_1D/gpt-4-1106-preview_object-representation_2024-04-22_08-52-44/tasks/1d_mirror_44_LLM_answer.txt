You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition across all examples is the presence of a smaller object with color 9 that swaps its position and color with another larger object, without changing the sizes of either object.
overall pattern: Identify the smaller object with color 9 and a larger object. Swap their colors and start_index positions, maintaining their original sizes and ensuring the end_index is adjusted accordingly to preserve the object size after the swap. All other attributes of the objects remain the same.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object of color 9 and size 1 (Object_2), swap the colors of the objects. Object_2 retains its position and size while the other object (Object_1) moves to the right by a number of positions equal to its size



transformation steps: ['Identify Object_1 and Object_2 based on the conditions', 'Swap the colors of Object_1 and Object_2', 'Retain the position and size of Object_2', 'Move Object_1 to the right by a number of positions equal to its own size from its original start position', 'Ensure that the dimensions of the sequence remain unchanged', 'Fill the original positions of Object_1 with the background color (0) as it has moved to a new position']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition across all examples is the presence of a smaller object with color 9 that swaps its position and color with another larger object, without changing the sizes of either object.
overall pattern: Identify the smaller object with color 9 and a larger object. Swap their colors and start_index positions, maintaining their original sizes and ensuring the end_index is adjusted accordingly to preserve the object size after the swap. All other attributes of the objects remain the same.


transformation steps: ['Identify the smaller object with color 9.', 'Identify the larger object with a different color.', 'Swap the start_index of the smaller object with the start_index of the larger object.', 'Change the color of the smaller object to the color of the larger object.', 'Change the color of the larger object to 9, which was the original color of the smaller object.', 'Adjust the end_index of the larger object to maintain its original size after the swap.', 'Leave all other pixels and objects that do not meet the above conditions unchanged.']


Test case:

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition across all examples is the presence of a smaller object with color 9 that swaps its position and color with another larger object, without changing the sizes of either object.
overall pattern: Identify the smaller object with color 9 and a larger object. Swap their colors and start_index positions, maintaining their original sizes and ensuring the end_index is adjusted accordingly to preserve the object size after the swap. All other attributes of the objects remain the same.


transformation steps: ['Identify the smaller object with color 9.', 'Identify the larger object with a different color.', 'Swap the start_index of the smaller object with the start_index of the larger object.', 'Change the color of the smaller object to the color of the larger object.', 'Change the color of the larger object to 9, which was the original color of the smaller object.', 'Adjust the end_index of the larger object to maintain its original size after the swap.', 'Leave all other pixels and objects that do not meet the above conditions unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 18],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 18]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation was not applied correctly. First, the 'size' of the objects was not preserved post-transformation. Object_1, which started as the larger object with a size of 4, should have remained with a size of 4, but the end_index in the output indicates it has a size of 4 (7 to 10 inclusive). However, Object_2, which started as the smaller object with a size of 1, should have remained with a size of 1, but the end_index in the output indicates it has a size of 1 (2 to 2 inclusive). Second, the swapping of positions was incorrect. The start_index of Object_1 should have become 7, and the start_index of Object_2 should have become 2, which is correct, but the end_index should have been adjusted to maintain the object sizes. Object_1 should have an end_index of 10 (7+size-1), which is correct, but Object_2 should have an end_index of 2 (2+size-1), which is also correct. Third, the color swap was done correctly, with Object_1 taking the color 9 and Object_2 taking the color 1. The result is that the transformation steps were followed partially, but the critical error was in preserving the size of both objects.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation was not applied correctly according to the transformation steps. The first object with color 1 starting from index 2 to 5 has been identified as the larger object, and the second object with color 9 at index 7 as the smaller object. The start_index positions appear to be swapped, with the larger object now starting at index 7 and the smaller at index 2. However, the sizes of the objects were not preserved after the swap. The transformed larger object (color 9) has the correct end_index of 10 to maintain its original size of 4, but the transformed smaller object (color 1) is incorrectly sized with a start_index of 2 and end_index of 2, resulting in a size of 1 instead of the original size of 1. The object sizes should have remained unchanged after the swap.",
