You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is conditional upon the objects being of the same color and not immediately adjacent (separated by background pixels).
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with the same color that are separated by background pixels. Merge them into one object by extending the size from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, keeping the color the same. This results in one larger object that encompasses the original objects and the space between them.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 18}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color and separated by any distance will merge
overall pattern: when two objects of the same color are present, they change by merging into a single larger object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object, thus increasing in size accordingly

conditions: The transformation is conditional upon the objects being of the same color and not immediately adjacent (separated by background pixels).
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with the same color that are separated by background pixels. Merge them into one object by extending the size from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, keeping the color the same. This results in one larger object that encompasses the original objects and the space between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Verify that there are exactly two objects in the sequence.', 'Check that the two objects have the same color.', 'Confirm that the objects are not immediately adjacent, meaning there is at least one background pixel (0) between them.', 'Merge the two objects by setting the start index of the merged object to the start index of the first object and the end index to the end index of the second object.', 'Fill all indices from the new start index to the new end index with the color of the original objects, effectively replacing the background pixels between the original objects with the object color.', 'The size of the new object is then the difference between the new end index and the new start index, plus one (to account for zero-indexing).', 'Output the transformed sequence with the new, merged object.']
