You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change when they contain pixels of a color that are in the minority compared to the predominant color of the object. The position or specific colors of the pixels do not matter, only the frequency of the colors within the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects by contiguous pixels of the same color. If an object contains pixels of a different color, count the occurrence of each color. The color that occurs most frequently becomes the color of the entire object, and all other colors are changed to match it.

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for change in all examples is the presence of one or more pixels of a different color within an object that otherwise consists of the same color. These differing pixels are transformed to match the dominant color of the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, examine the sequence for objects. If an object contains pixels of a different color than the majority of the pixels in the object, change those differing pixels to the dominant color to create a uniform object. No changes are made to the positions or size of the objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change when they contain pixels of a color that are in the minority compared to the predominant color of the object. The position or specific colors of the pixels do not matter, only the frequency of the colors within the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects by contiguous pixels of the same color. If an object contains pixels of a different color, count the occurrence of each color. The color that occurs most frequently becomes the color of the entire object, and all other colors are changed to match it.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by detecting contiguous pixels of the same color.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each distinct color present within the object.', 'Determine the predominant color within the object, which is the color with the highest frequency.', 'If there is a tie in frequency, the lowest numerical color value becomes the predominant color.', 'Replace all pixels within the object with the predominant color.', 'Maintain the position and size of the object, only altering the colors of the pixels that do not match the predominant color.', 'Repeat this process for all objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change when they contain pixels of a color that are in the minority compared to the predominant color of the object. The position or specific colors of the pixels do not matter, only the frequency of the colors within the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects by contiguous pixels of the same color. If an object contains pixels of a different color, count the occurrence of each color. The color that occurs most frequently becomes the color of the entire object, and all other colors are changed to match it.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by detecting contiguous pixels of the same color.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each distinct color present within the object.', 'Determine the predominant color within the object, which is the color with the highest frequency.', 'If there is a tie in frequency, the lowest numerical color value becomes the predominant color.', 'Replace all pixels within the object with the predominant color.', 'Maintain the position and size of the object, only altering the colors of the pixels that do not match the predominant color.', 'Repeat this process for all objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

If an object contains pixels of a different color, count the occurrence of each color. The color that occurs most frequently becomes the color of the entire object, and all other colors are changed to match it.

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change when they contain pixels of a color that are in the minority compared to the predominant color of the object. The position or specific colors of the pixels do not matter, only the frequency of the colors within the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects by contiguous pixels of the same color. If an object contains pixels of a different color, count the occurrence of each color. The color that occurs most frequently becomes the color of the entire object, and all other colors are changed to match it.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by detecting contiguous pixels of the same color.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each distinct color present within the object.', 'Determine the predominant color within the object, which is the color with the highest frequency.', 'If there is a tie in frequency, the lowest numerical color value becomes the predominant color.', 'Replace all pixels within the object with the predominant color.', 'Maintain the position and size of the object, only altering the colors of the pixels that do not match the predominant color.', 'Repeat this process for all objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change when they contain pixels of a color that are in the minority compared to the predominant color of the object. The position or specific colors of the pixels do not matter, only the frequency of the colors within the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects by contiguous pixels of the same color. If an object contains pixels of a different color, count the occurrence of each color. The color that occurs most frequently becomes the color of the entire object, and all other colors are changed to match it.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by detecting contiguous pixels of the same color.', 'For each object, count the frequency of each distinct color present within the object.', 'Determine the predominant color within the object, which is the color with the highest frequency.', 'If there is a tie in frequency, the lowest numerical color value becomes the predominant color.', 'Replace all pixels within the object with the predominant color.', 'Maintain the position and size of the object, only altering the colors of the pixels that do not match the predominant color.', 'Repeat this process for all objects in the input sequence to produce the output sequence.']

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
