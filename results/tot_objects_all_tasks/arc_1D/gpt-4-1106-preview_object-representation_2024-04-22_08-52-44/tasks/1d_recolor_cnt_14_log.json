The size determines the new color of the object in the output sequence.\noverall pattern: The transformation rule is that objects in the input sequence change color in the output sequence based on their size. Specifically, objects of size 1 change to color 9, objects of size 2 change to color 3, and objects of size 3 change to color 2. No other attributes of the objects change; their position and size remain the same. This rule applies regardless of the original color of the objects.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['For each object in the input sequence:', '1. Determine the size of the object.', '2. If the object size is 1, change its color to 9.', '3. If the object size is 2, change its color to 3.', '4. If the object size is 3, change its color to 2.', \"5.
