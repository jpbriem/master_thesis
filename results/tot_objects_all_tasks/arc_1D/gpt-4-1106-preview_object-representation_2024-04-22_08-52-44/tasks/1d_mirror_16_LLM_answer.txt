You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation seems to consistently swap the colors of the first and second objects. The first object is moved to the original position of the second object. The second object is moved three indices to the right from its original position. The sizes of the objects do not change.
overall pattern: For any input, swap the colors between the first and second object. Move the first object to the starting position of the second object, and move the second object three indices to the right from its original position. Maintain the original sizes of the objects.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

transformation steps: ['Identify Object_1 and Object_2 based on their start_index', 'Swap the colors of Object_1 and Object_2', 'Calculate the distance between the start_index of Object_1 and Object_2', 'Shift Object_1 to the right by the calculated distance', 'Shift Object_2 to the right by the calculated distance', 'Maintain the size of each object constant during the shift', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The color of each object is swapped. The first object moves to the right by the size of the second object plus a constant value. The second object moves to the left by its size plus a constant value that is the same as for the first object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, swap colors between the first and second objects. Move the first object to the right by the size of the second object plus a constant offset. Move the second object to the left by its size plus the same constant offset. Keep the size of the objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the sequence, noting their colors, sizes, and positions.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects, so the color of the first object becomes the color of the second, and vice versa.', 'Calculate the constant offset value by observing the change in position of the objects between the input and output.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 8}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 7}

overall pattern:
conditions: The color of each object is swapped. The first object moves to the right by the size of the second object plus a constant value. The second object moves to the left by its size plus a constant value that is the same as for the first object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, swap colors between the first and second objects. Move the first object to the right by the size of the second object plus a constant offset. Move the second object to the left by its size plus the same constant offset. Keep the size of the objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the sequence, noting their colors, sizes, and positions.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects, so the color of the first object becomes the color of the second, and vice versa.', 'Calculate the constant offset value by observing the change in position of the objects between the input and output. This value is the same for both objects.', 'Move the first object to the right by the size of the second object plus the constant offset.', 'Move the second object to the left by its own size plus the constant offset.', 'The size of the objects remains unchanged during the transformation.', 'The resulting sequence should maintain the original dimension, filling any gaps with the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 29]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output is incorrect based on the transformation pattern described. According to the pattern, we should swap the colors of Object_1 and Object_2. In the input, Object_1 is of color 1 and spans indices 6 to 12, and Object_2 is of color 9 and is at index 15. After swapping colors, Object_1 should become color 9, and Object_2 should become color 1, which is correctly reflected in the test output. However, the positions of the objects after the transformation are incorrect. The constant offset can be determined from the examples provided. In Example_1, Object_1 moves from starting index 0 to 14, which is a move of 14 places to the right, and Object_2 moves from starting index 10 to 10, which is a move of 0 places to the left. Considering that Object_2 has a size of 1, the constant offset is calculated as 14 - 1 = 13. Applying this to the test case, Object_1 should move to the right by the size of Object_2 (1) plus the constant offset (13), which would result in a new start index of 6 + 1 + 13 = 20. Object_2 should move to the left by its own size (1) plus the constant offset (13), resulting in a new start index of 15 - 1 - 13 = 1. The correct output objects after transformation should therefore be Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 7}, and Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not seem to follow the transformation pattern correctly. According to the overall pattern, the colors of the objects should be swapped, and their positions should be moved accordingly. However, the test output shows that the position of Object_2 has been moved to the left by only 4 positions (from start_index 15 to 11), whereas according to the transformation steps, it should have been moved by its size (1) plus the constant offset. The constant offset can be determined from the given examples: In Example_1, Object_1 moves from end_index 6 to start_index 14 (a shift of 8 positions to the right), and Object_2 moves from start_index 10 to end_index 20 (a shift of 10 positions to the left). Thus, the constant offset is 3, as (8 - size of Object_2) or (10 - size of Object_1) both equal 3. Therefore, Object_2 should have been moved to the left by its size (1) plus the constant offset (3), for a total of 4 positions, ending at start_index 11, which is correct for Object_2. However, Object_1 should have been moved to the right by the size of Object_2 (1) plus the constant offset (3), for a total of 4 positions, starting at index 15 + 4 = 19. But in the test output, Object_1 starts at index 15, which is where Object_2 was originally, and this does not reflect the correct transformation according to the given pattern.",
