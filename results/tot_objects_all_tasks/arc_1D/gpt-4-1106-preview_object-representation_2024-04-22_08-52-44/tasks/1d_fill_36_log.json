The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The input contains two objects of the same color (color 2), which are located at indices 2 and 6 respectively, each with a size of 1. According to the transformation pattern, these two objects should be merged into one object. The transformation steps include calculating the distance between the objects, which is (6 - 2 - 1) = 3. The new object should have the same color as the original objects, which is 2. The start index is correctly set to the start index of the first object, which is 2. The end index is correctly set to the end index of the second object, which is 6. The size of the new object should be the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the distance between them, which is (1 + 1 + 3) = 5. The output object has these exact characteristics, indicating that the transformation was applied correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output appears to be incorrect based on the transformation steps provided. According to the steps, the new object's size should be the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the distance between them. In this case, the sizes of the original objects are both 1, and the distance between them is (6 - 2 - 1) = 3. Hence, the size of the new object should be (1 + 1 + 3) = 5. However, the start_index and end_index of the new object should span from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, which they do correctly. But despite the correct start and end indices, the size of the new object is incorrectly calculated as 5 instead of the correct size which should be (1 + 3 + 1) = 5. This appears to be a discrepancy in the explanation rather than the calculation, as the size is correctly calculated but described incorrectly in the transformation steps. If we follow the pattern as described in the examples, the transformation seems to be correct.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}"
