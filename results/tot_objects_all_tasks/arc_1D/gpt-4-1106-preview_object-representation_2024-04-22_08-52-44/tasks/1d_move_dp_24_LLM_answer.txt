You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern involves moving larger objects to the right. The number of positions moved seems to be half the size of the object, rounded down. Objects of size 1 remain in their original position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object that is larger than 1 pixel in size to the right by an amount equal to half its size, rounded down. Objects that are a single pixel in size should not be moved.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, calculate its size', 'Determine if the object size is greater than 1', 'If the object size is greater than 1, calculate the move distance as half the object size, rounded down', 'Move the object to the right by the calculated distance', 'Repeat the process for each object', 'Ensure objects of size 1 remain in their original position', 'Output the transformed sequence']

input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern involves moving larger objects to the right. The number of positions moved seems to be half the size of the object, rounded down. Objects of size 1 remain in their original position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object that is larger than 1 pixel in size to the right by an amount equal to half its size, rounded down. Objects that are a single pixel in size should not be moved.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, calculate its size', 'Determine if the object size is greater than 1', 'If the object size is greater than 1, calculate the move distance as half the object size, rounded down', 'Move the object to the right by the calculated distance', 'Repeat the process for each object', 'Ensure objects of size 1 remain in their original position', 'Output the transformed sequence']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 26]
transformed objects: [{'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}, {'color': 8, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output appears to be incorrect. According to the transformation pattern, objects larger than 1 pixel in size should be moved to the right by an amount equal to half their size, rounded down. Object_1 has a size of 14, so it should be moved 7 positions to the right. However, the start_index of Object_1 in the output is given as 13, which indicates it was moved by 7 positions (from 6 to 13), but according to the pattern, the end_index should also be shifted by the same amount, which would result in an end_index of 26 (19 + 7). However, in the test output, the end_index of Object_1 is also 26, which is correct. This indicates that there might be a typo or mistake in the start_index of the transformed Object_1. The correct start_index should be 13 (6 + 7), and the end_index is correctly given as 26. Object_2 is of size 1 and remains at its original position, which is consistent with the transformation pattern.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "To analyze the test output, we will follow the transformation steps and apply them to the test input and compare the result with the given test output. The test input has two objects. Object_1 has a size of 14, which means according to the overall pattern it should be moved 7 positions to the right (14 / 2 = 7). The start_index should therefore be 6 + 7 = 13, and the end_index should be 19 + 7 = 26, which matches the given test output. Object_2 has a size of 1, so according to the pattern, it should not be moved. The start_index and end_index of 24 remain the same, which also matches the given test output. Both objects are transformed correctly according to the transformation steps and the overall pattern.",
