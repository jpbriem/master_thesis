You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of any color other than 1 and size greater than 1 shift their starting position to the right by a number of places equal to the difference between their end index and the total dimension minus 10. Objects that are color 1 and size 1 remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the first object that is not color 1 and size 1. Calculate the shift amount by taking the difference between the total dimension (30) and the end index of the first object, subtracting 10 from this difference. Shift the starting and end indices of the first object to the right by the calculated amount, without changing its size or color. Leave any object that is color 1 and size 1 in its original position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Larger objects move to the right while smaller objects remain stationary
overall pattern: If an object is larger than all others, move it to the right by half its size (rounded down), keep smaller objects stationary


transformation steps: ['Identify the largest object(s) in the sequence based on size.', 'For each largest object, calculate half of its size and round down if necessary.', 'Move the largest object(s) to the right by the calculated number of positions.', 'Ensure that other objects remain unchanged in their positions.', 'Maintain the background (0s) and other object colors as they are.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the objects in their new positions, preserving the original sequence length.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 24}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

This implies the end index should be 25 + 12 = 37, which is not possible within a 30-length sequence. Instead, the object should be moved right until the end index lands at the last available position, which is 29. The start index should then be 29 - size + 1 = 29 - 24 + 1 = 6.

Firstly, the size of Object_1 after transformation has decreased from 24 to 16, which should not happen as per the transformation steps that require the object size to remain constant. The object should only move positions. Secondly, the movement of Object_1 is incorrect. Based on the pattern, it should move to the right by half its size, i.e., 12 positions (half of 24, rounded down), but it only moved 12 positions to start at index 14, which is inconsistent with maintaining the object's size. Lastly, Object_2 remains stationary which is correct, but it should not overlap with Object_1 after transformation.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The given test output does not follow the overall pattern and transformation steps correctly. The largest object (Object_1 with color 7, size 24) should have been moved to the right by half its size, which is 12 positions (24/2 rounded down). However, in the test output, Object_1 starts at index 14 and ends at index 29, which indicates it has moved by only 12 positions (14 - 2 where it originally started), and its size has been incorrectly reduced from 24 to 16. The ending index should have been 25 + 12 = 37, which is beyond the dimension limit. Since the output dimension is [1, 30], Object_1 should have been moved to the right in such a way that it ends at index 29, which would make the start index 29 - 24 + 1 = 6. Thus, Object_1 should have started at index 6, not at index 14. Additionally, Object_2 remains stationary, which is correct according to the pattern. However, due to the incorrect transformation of Object_1, the overall test output is incorrect.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input has two objects with one of them being significantly larger than the other. According to the transformation steps, we should only move the largest object to the right by half its size (rounded down), while the smaller object should remain stationary. The largest object (Object_1) has a size of 24, so it should be moved to the right by 12 positions. Since its original start_index is 2, the new start_index after transformation should be 2 + 12 = 14, which is correct. However, the end_index should be 25 + 12 = 37. Since the dimension of the sequence is [1, 30], the object cannot extend beyond the 29th position. Therefore, the end_index of 29 for Object_1 is correct, but the size should still reflect the original size of 24, not the listed size of 16. The smaller object (Object_2) should remain at its original position with start_index and end_index of 28. The test output shows Object_2 correctly unchanged. However, the size of the largest object after transformation is incorrect, which suggests an error in the transformation process.",
