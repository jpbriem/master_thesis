Objects of size 1 are transformed by increasing their size to 3 and moving their start_index and end_index one position to the left. This rule applies to all objects of size 1, irrespective of their color or initial position.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1, move the start_index one position to the left.', 'Adjust the end_index to be two positions to the right of the new start_index, resulting in a size of 3 for the object.', 'Keep the color of the object the same.', 'Leave objects of size greater than 1 at their original positions and sizes.', 'Apply these steps to all objects of size 1 in the sequence to achieve the output.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers\ntransformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"No test case output dimension or transformed objects were provided, thus it is not possible to analyze the test output against the transformation instructions.\", \"value\": 0}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output has not been provided, therefore it is not possible to analyze the transformation and determine if the test input was correctly transformed into the test output.
