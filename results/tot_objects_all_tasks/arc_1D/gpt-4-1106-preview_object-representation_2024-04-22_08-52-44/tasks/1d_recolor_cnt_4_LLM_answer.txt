You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The objects change color based on their size. Objects of size 1 decrease their color value by 1. Objects of size 2 decrease their color value by 4. Objects of size 3 decrease their color value by 2. However, there are inconsistencies or exceptions that aren't explained by the data provided.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the size of each object. If the size is 1, decrease the color value by 1. If the size is 2, decrease the color value by 4. If the size is 3, decrease the color value by 2. This rule may have exceptions or additional conditions not represented by the examples given.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation of objects seems to follow a pattern based on their sequence number. The first object changes to color 4 in the first example, to color 1 in the second and third examples. The second object changes to color 3 in all examples. The third object changes to color 1, 4, and 4 respectively. From the fourth object onwards, the color change is consistent to color 3 in the first example, and to color 4 in the third example.
overall pattern: To transform any input sequence into its output, apply the following rules: The first object changes to a different color not observed in the pattern (possibly the color of the first object minus one, if starting with color 5). The second object changes to color 3. The third object changes to a color that alternates between color 1 and color 4. From the fourth object onwards, change the color to 3 if the third object is color 1, and to color 4 if the third object is color 4. The size and position of the objects do not change.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The change in color for each object depends on its order in the sequence. The first object changes to color 1, the second to color 3, the third to color 4, and this pattern repeats for subsequent objects, resetting after the third object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based only on the input, the following rules apply: The first object in the sequence changes to color 1, the second to color 3, the third to color 4, and this cycle repeats for every group of three objects in the sequence. The size and position of the objects do not change.



transformation steps: ['Iterate over the sequence of objects.', 'Group the objects in sets of three.', 'For each group, apply the following transformations:', 'Change the color of the first object in the group to 1.', 'Change the color of the second object in the group to 3.', 'Change the color of the third object in the group to 4.', 'If the number of objects is not a multiple of three, apply the transformations to the remaining objects in the final group.', 'Maintain the size and position of each object throughout the transformation process.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the sequence', 'For the first object, change its color to 1', 'For the second object, change its color to 3', 'For the third object, change its color to 4', 'For the fourth object, change its color to 1', 'For the fifth object, change its color to 3', 'Continue this color change pattern for subsequent objects, following the sequence 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, ...', 'Maintain the positions and sizes of all objects unchanged']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The change in color for each object depends on its order in the sequence. The first object changes to color 1, the second to color 3, the third to color 4, and this pattern repeats for subsequent objects, resetting after the third object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based only on the input, the following rules apply: The first object in the sequence changes to color 1, the second to color 3, the third to color 4, and this cycle repeats for every group of three objects in the sequence. The size and position of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Iterate over the sequence of objects.', 'Group the objects in sets of three.', 'For each group, apply the following transformations:', 'Change the color of the first object in the group to 1.', 'Change the color of the second object in the group to 3.', 'Change the color of the third object in the group to 4.', 'If the number of objects is not a multiple of three, apply the transformations to the remaining objects in the final group.', 'Maintain the size and position of each object throughout the transformation process.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The change in color for each object depends on its order in the sequence. The first object changes to color 1, the second to color 3, the third to color 4, and this pattern repeats for subsequent objects, resetting after the third object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based only on the input, the following rules apply: The first object in the sequence changes to color 1, the second to color 3, the third to color 4, and this cycle repeats for every group of three objects in the sequence. The size and position of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Iterate over the sequence of objects.', 'Group the objects in sets of three.', 'For each group, apply the following transformations:', 'Change the color of the first object in the group to 1.', 'Change the color of the second object in the group to 3.', 'Change the color of the third object in the group to 4.', 'If the number of objects is not a multiple of three, apply the transformations to the remaining objects in the final group.', 'Maintain the size and position of each object throughout the transformation process.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 30]
transformed objects: [{'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 2}, {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output seems to follow the transformation pattern correctly. The input sequence is broken down into objects based on the color and contiguous indices. According to the pattern, the colors are transformed in sets of three, where the first object turns to color 1, the second to color 3, and the third to color 4, then the pattern repeats. The test input has five objects, and these have been transformed correctly in the test output: Object_1 to color 1, Object_2 to color 3, Object_3 to color 4, Object_4 (which starts a new set of three) to color 1, and Object_5 to color 3. The sizes and positions of the objects have been maintained as per the transformation rules. Therefore, the transformation has been correctly applied.",
