You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are in pairs of the same color, separated by a consistent number of background pixels. The transformation applies uniformly across all examples.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a fixed number of background pixels. Stretch each pair to merge into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object. Maintain the original color, and the size of the new object is determined by the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels between them.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the pairs of objects with the same color.', 'For each pair, calculate the number of background pixels separating the two objects.', 'Check if the distance of background pixels between objects of a pair is consistent across all pairs.', 'Stretch the first object in each pair to merge with the second object.', 'The start index of the new merged object is the start index of the first object in the pair.', 'The end index of the new merged object is the end index of the second object in the pair.', 'Determine the new size of the merged object by adding the sizes of both original objects plus the number of background pixels between them.', 'Preserve the original color of the objects in the merged object.', 'Remove the original pairs of objects and replace them with the new merged objects.', 'Ensure that all other pixels not part of any transformation remain unchanged.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge if there is an odd number of background pixels between them
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify all objects of the same color and check the number of background pixels between consecutive objects; if the number is odd, merge the objects into one, with the new size being the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the distance between them



transformation steps: ['Iterate over the sequence of pixels to identify all objects, characterized by adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'For each identified object, store its color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each group of objects with the same color, iterate over pairs of consecutive objects.', 'For each pair of consecutive objects, calculate the number of background pixels between them.', 'If the number of background pixels between two objects is odd, merge the two objects into one by:', '  - Setting the start index of the merged object to the start index of the first object.', '  - Setting the end index of the merged object to the end index of the second object.', '  - Calculating the new size of the merged object as the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the distance between them.', 'Repeat the merging process for all pairs of objects where the conditions are met.', 'Construct the output sequence by placing the merged objects at their respective start and end indices, filling the gaps with the background pixel (0).', 'Ensure the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are in pairs of the same color, separated by a consistent number of background pixels. The transformation applies uniformly across all examples.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a fixed number of background pixels. Stretch each pair to merge into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object. Maintain the original color, and the size of the new object is determined by the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the pairs of objects with the same color.', 'For each pair, calculate the number of background pixels separating the two objects.', 'Check if the distance of background pixels between objects of a pair is consistent across all pairs.', 'Stretch the first object in each pair to merge with the second object.', 'The start index of the new merged object is the start index of the first object in the pair.', 'The end index of the new merged object is the end index of the second object in the pair.', 'Determine the new size of the merged object by adding the sizes of both original objects plus the number of background pixels between them.', 'Preserve the original color of the objects in the merged object.', 'Remove the original pairs of objects and replace them with the new merged objects.', 'Ensure that all other pixels not part of any transformation remain unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 54],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 51, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a fixed number of background pixels. Stretch each pair to merge into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object. Maintain the original color, and the size of the new object is determined by the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels between them.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are in pairs of the same color, separated by a consistent number of background pixels. The transformation applies uniformly across all examples.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a fixed number of background pixels. Stretch each pair to merge into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object. Maintain the original color, and the size of the new object is determined by the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the pairs of objects with the same color.', 'For each pair, calculate the number of background pixels separating the two objects.', 'Check if the distance of background pixels between objects of a pair is consistent across all pairs.', 'Stretch the first object in each pair to merge with the second object.', 'The start index of the new merged object is the start index of the first object in the pair.', 'The end index of the new merged object is the end index of the second object in the pair.', 'Determine the new size of the merged object by adding the sizes of both original objects plus the number of background pixels between them.', 'Preserve the original color of the objects in the merged object.', 'Remove the original pairs of objects and replace them with the new merged objects.', 'Ensure that all other pixels not part of any transformation remain unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 54],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 51, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
