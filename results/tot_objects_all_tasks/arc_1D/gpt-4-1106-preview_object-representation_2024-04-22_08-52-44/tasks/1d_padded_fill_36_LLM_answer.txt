You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color that have a consistent gap of indices between them are merged and expanded in the output
overall pattern: Identify pairs of objects of the same color with consistent gaps between their positions in the input. In the output, these objects are merged into single objects that span from the starting index of the first to the ending index of the second object in each pair, with their size being equal to the sum of the gap plus the size of one of the original objects



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Group objects by color.', 'Within each color group, identify pairs of objects with consistent gaps between them.', 'For each identified pair, merge the objects into a single object in the output sequence.', 'The start index of the merged object is the same as the start index of the first object of the pair.', 'The end index of the merged object is the same as the end index of the second object of the pair.', 'The size of the merged object is calculated as the sum of the original sizes plus the size of the gap between the original objects.', 'If there are more than two objects in a group with consistent gaps, repeat the merging process for each consecutive pair.', 'Retain the original color for each merged object.', 'Place the merged objects in the output sequence at the corresponding start indices.', 'Fill all other positions in the output sequence with the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [1, 39], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 34, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 39], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 35, 'end_index': 35, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 39], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 36, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 39], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 36, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects are paired and the transformation applies to all objects regardless of color
overall pattern: pair objects sequentially, the first object of the pair defines the new start_index, the second object of the pair defines the new end_index, and the new size is the difference between the end_index and start_index plus 1; maintain the object's original color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Pair objects sequentially, treating the sequence as an ordered list (first with second, third with fourth, and so on).', "For each pair of objects, maintain the color of the 'leading' object.", "Define the start_index of the new object as the start_index of the 'leading' object in the pair.", "Define the end_index of the new object as the end_index of the 'trailing' object in the pair.", 'Calculate the size of the new object by subtracting the new start_index from the new end_index and then adding one.', 'Replace the original paired objects with the new object in the output sequence.', 'Leave all other pixels (including background pixels) unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 39],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 32, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 1}

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The objects are paired with a consistent gap between them: the first and second objects have a gap of 3 indices, the third and fourth objects have a gap of 3 indices, and the fifth and sixth objects also have a gap of 3 indices. According to the overall pattern, these pairs of objects are merged into single objects that span from the start index of the first to the end index of the second object of each pair. The size of each merged object is correctly calculated as the sum of the original sizes (1 pixel each) plus the size of the gap (3 indices), resulting in a size of 5 for each merged object. The start and end indices of the transformed objects match the indices of the original paired objects in the input sequence, and the color is retained as 2. All other positions in the output sequence are filled with the background color (0), which is implied as the output dimension matches the input dimension and only the transformed objects are specified. Therefore, the transformation has been applied correctly.",

  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has correctly identified and transformed the objects following the given transformation steps. The input objects are all of color 2 with a single pixel size and consistent gaps between them. According to the transformation steps, pairs of objects with consistent gaps should be merged into single objects. The test output shows that each pair of objects (Object_1 and Object_2, Object_3 and Object_4, Object_5 and Object_6) has been correctly merged. The start index of each merged object corresponds to the start index of the first object in the pair, and the end index corresponds to the end index of the second object in the pair. The size of each merged object is the sum of the original sizes (1 pixel each) plus the size of the gap (3 pixels), which equals 5 pixels as indicated in the output. The color of the merged objects has been retained as 2, and the output sequence is filled with the background color (0) in all other positions. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.",
