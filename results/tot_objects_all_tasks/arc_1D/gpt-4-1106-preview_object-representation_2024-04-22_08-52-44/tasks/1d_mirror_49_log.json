For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: the presence of an object with color 9 determines the swapping of colors and places with the other object. The object with color 9 always remains first and stationary in position and size\noverall pattern: swap the colors of the objects, the object with color 9 retains its position and size and becomes the first object, the other object moves to the right by a number of positions equal to its size and becomes the second object\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the object with color 9 and note its position and size.', 'Identify the other object(s) and note their colors, positions, and sizes.', 'Swap the colors of the object with color 9 with the color of the other object.', 'Move the object that did not originally have color 9 to the right by a number of positions equal to its size. Its size remains unchanged.', 'Ensure that the object with the new color 9 retains its original position and size in the output sequence.', 'Fill in any gaps between objects with the background color (0).', 'If there are additional objects, leave them unchanged in their position and color.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
