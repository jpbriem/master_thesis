You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects change position by shifting 3 places to the right.
overall pattern: For any input, the type of object that changes is the existing object, it changes by shifting its position 3 places to the right, maintaining its size and color.

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

After the transformation, the object's start_index should be 5 (2+3), and its end_index should be 27 (25+3), maintaining the size of 24. However, the end_index in the test output is 28, which incorrectly increases the size of the object to 25. This is an error as the object size should remain constant after the shift. Moreover, the last positions (28, 29) should have been filled with the background color (0) to maintain the original sequence dimension. The output object's size does not match the input object's size, and it violates the rule of maintaining the object's integrity after the shift.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 10}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects change position by shifting 3 places to the right.
overall pattern: For any input, the type of object that changes is the existing object, it changes by shifting its position 3 places to the right, maintaining its size and color.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence. An object is a sequence of adjacent non-zero pixels of the same color.', 'For each object in the input sequence, calculate its new starting and ending indices by adding 3 to the current start_index and end_index.', 'Shift each object in the input sequence 3 places to the right by moving the sequence of non-zero pixels that represent the object to the new calculated indices.', 'Fill in the vacated positions on the left of the shifted object with the background color (0).', 'Ensure that the shifting of objects does not cause any overlap between objects. If the dimension of the sequence allows, each object should maintain its integrity after the shift.', 'Maintain the original sequence dimension by filling any new positions at the end of the sequence, if needed, with the background color (0) due to the right shift.', 'Verify that each object maintains its original color and size after the shift.', 'Output the transformed sequence as the result.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 24}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 30]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 24}
