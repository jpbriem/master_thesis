The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 5, 'size':

The size of the object remains unchanged at 3, which is consistent with the stated transformation steps and the overall pattern that objects move 2 positions to the right while maintaining their color and size. The transformation steps were followed correctly: the object was identified, its indices were recalculated by adding 2, it was shifted to the new position, and the size was maintained. The sequence's length remained unchanged, and any vacated positions at the beginning of the sequence should have been filled with the background color, which is assumed to be the case since the dimension of the output sequence is the same as the input. Thus, the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test case output does not align with the specified transformation steps. The input object has a size of 3, but an end_index of 7, which suggests an incorrect size calculation, as the start_index is 5. The size should equal the end_index minus the start_index plus one. The correct size is 7 - 5 + 1 = 3. In the output, the object was moved correctly by 2 positions to the right, with a new start_index of 7 and an end_index of 9, which keeps the size at 3. However, the test case input specifies the object size as 3, but the start_index and end_index suggest a size of 2. This inconsistency indicates an error in the input object description. Assuming the input object size should indeed be 3, the correct end_index should have been 8 (5 + 3 - 1), not 7. If the input object description was accurate, then the output object would have a size of 2, not 3, and would also be incorrect. Therefore, the test output is correct relative to the described transformation steps but based on an incorrect input object description.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}"
