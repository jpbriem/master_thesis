You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with a size greater than 1 are moved to the right while objects with a size of 1 remain in the same position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: IF the object size is greater than 1, THEN move the object a certain number of positions to the right, which is determined by a specific rule based on the input. Objects with size 1 do not change their position.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the size is greater than 1.', "If an object's size is 1, do not change its position in the output sequence.", "If an object's size is greater than 1, calculate its new start and end index by adding the determined movement offset to its original start and end indices.", 'Move the object to the right by the calculated offset, ensuring that it does not overlap with stationary objects or go beyond the sequence boundary.', 'Fill the spaces vacated by moved objects with the background color (0).', 'Maintain the original sequence dimension by ensuring that the output sequence length is unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

Assuming that the movement offset for Object_1 is correct based on an unspecified rule, the transformation appears to be applied properly. The output sequence length remains unchanged at 29, satisfying the requirement to maintain the original sequence dimension. Without more information on how the offset is calculated, we cannot definitively rate the accuracy of the transformation. Assuming the offset is correct, the test output would be rated highly.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with a size greater than 1 are moved to the right while objects with a size of 1 remain in the same position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: IF the object size is greater than 1, THEN move the object a certain number of positions to the right, which is determined by a specific rule based on the input. Objects with size 1 do not change their position.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the size is greater than 1.', "If an object's size is 1, do not change its position in the output sequence.", "If an object's size is greater than 1, calculate its new start and end index by adding the determined movement offset to its original start and end indices.", 'Move the object to the right by the calculated offset, ensuring that it does not overlap with stationary objects or go beyond the sequence boundary.', 'Fill the spaces vacated by moved objects with the background color (0).', 'Maintain the original sequence dimension by ensuring that the output sequence length is unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 29]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation seems incorrect. First, the initial size of Object_1 is 16, and after the transformation, its size has changed to 12, which should not happen according to the transformation rules; the size should remain the same. Moreover, the transformation does not specify that the size of objects should change, only their positions. Second, the end index of Object_1 overlaps with the start index of Object_2, which violates the rule of not overlapping stationary objects. The end index of Object_1 should be 27, not 28, to prevent overlap with Object_2, which remains stationary. Lastly, since the size of Object_1 has not been preserved during the transformation, it indicates a fundamental error in applying the transformation steps.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output shows that Object_1 was moved from its initial position starting at index 6 to index 17, and its size was reduced from 16 to 12. According to the transformation steps, objects greater than size 1 should be moved to the right without changing their size, and objects with size 1 should not change their position. Object_2 remains in the same position, which is correct. However, Object_1 should have maintained its original size after being moved. The size reduction indicates an error in the transformation process. Furthermore, the end index of Object_1 in the output sequence should be start_index + size - 1 (in this case, 17 + 16 - 1 = 32), which is beyond the sequence boundary. This suggests the potential issue of the object going beyond the sequence boundary was not handled correctly. Since the sequence boundary cannot be exceeded, the object should have been truncated or the transformation rule adjusted to prevent boundary overflow.",
