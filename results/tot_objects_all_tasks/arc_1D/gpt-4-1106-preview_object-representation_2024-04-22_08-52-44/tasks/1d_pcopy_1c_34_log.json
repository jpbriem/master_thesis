For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects of the same color and size 1 change. The change occurs regardless of the object color.\noverall pattern: If an object has size 1, increase its size to 3 and shift its position one index to the left. All objects of size greater than 1 remain unchanged.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each object of size 1, shift its start_index one position to the left.', 'Expand the size of each object of size 1 to 3 by assigning the same color to the two adjacent pixels on the right.', 'Leave objects of size greater than 1 unchanged.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
