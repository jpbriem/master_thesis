You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

conditions: Objects swap positions. Single-colored objects with color other than 9 change their color to 9. The object with color 9 does not change in color or size and serves as an anchor point for the other object's new position, which is always two positions to the right of the original position of the object with color 9.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: 1. Identify the object with color 9, which will not change. 2. The other object will change its color to 9. 3. Swap positions of the two objects while maintaining their sizes. 4. Move the newly recolored object two positions to the right of the original position of the object with color 9.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition across all examples is the presence of an object with color 9, which seems to trigger the exchange of colors and positions between Object_1 and Object_2.
overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object with color 9, Object_1 and Object_2 exchange colors. Object_1 takes the starting position of the object with color 9, and the object with color 9 moves two positions after the end of Object_1's original position in the input. The size of the objects remains unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition across all examples is the presence of an object with color 9, which seems to trigger the exchange of colors and positions between Object_1 and Object_2.
overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object with color 9, Object_1 and Object_2 exchange colors. Object_1 takes the starting position of the object with color 9, and the object with color 9 moves two positions after the end of Object_1's original position in the input. The size of the objects remains unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first two objects in the input sequence.', 'Confirm that one of the objects has a color value of 9.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Place the object that originally had color 9 at the starting index where the other object was located.', "Move the object that did not originally have color 9 to a new starting index, which is two positions after the end index of the object's original position.", 'Ensure that the sizes of the objects remain unchanged during the transformation.']

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes in objects are based on their colors and positions. An object with color 9 swaps colors with the other object and both objects shift their positions right by 2 places.
overall pattern: For any input, identify the object with color 9 and any other object. Swap their colors and shift each object's position to the right by 2 places.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Check the color of each object to find the object with color 9.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects so that the object which had color 9 takes the color of the other object, and vice versa.', "Shift the position of both objects to the right by 2 places.

output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition across all examples is the presence of an object with color 9, which seems to trigger the exchange of colors and positions between Object_1 and Object_2.
overall pattern: For any input, if there is an object with color 9, Object_1 and Object_2 exchange colors. Object_1 takes the starting position of the object with color 9, and the object with color 9 moves two positions after the end of Object_1's original position in the input. The size of the objects remains unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first two objects in the input sequence.', 'Confirm that one of the objects has a color value of 9.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Place the object that originally had color 9 at the starting index where the other object was located.', "Move the object that did not originally have color 9 to a new starting index, which is two positions after the end index of the object's original position.", 'Ensure that the sizes of the objects remain unchanged during the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 16]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output appears to be in accordance with the overall pattern and transformation steps provided. The steps are: 1. Two objects are identified in the input sequence, Object_1 with color 7 and Object_2 with color 9. 2. Object_2 is confirmed to have color 9. 3. The colors of Object_1 and Object_2 are swapped. 4. The object that originally had color 9 (Object_1 now) is placed at the starting index of where Object_1 was located in the input, which is index 7. 5. The object without color 9 originally (Object_2 now) is moved to a new starting index, which is two positions after the end index of Object_1's original position (end_index: 5 + 2 = 7, so the new start_index is 7 + 2 = 9, but the sequence shows a start_index of 10, which is an error based on the transformation steps). 6. The sizes of the objects remain unchanged, which is correct. However, there is an error in the start index of Object_2; according to the transformation steps, it should be at index 9 instead of 10.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation appears to have been applied correctly. The input sequence has two objects, with Object_2 being colored 9, which matches the condition for the transformation. According to the transformation steps, the colors of Object_1 and Object_2 should be swapped, which has been reflected in the output. Object_1, which originally had the color 7, has taken over the position and color of Object_2, becoming {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}. Furthermore, Object_2, which originally had the color 9, has moved to a new starting index that is two positions after the original end index of Object_1, resulting in {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}. The sizes of both objects remain unchanged, which is also in accordance with the transformation steps. The overall pattern and transformation steps are correctly applied in the test case output.",
