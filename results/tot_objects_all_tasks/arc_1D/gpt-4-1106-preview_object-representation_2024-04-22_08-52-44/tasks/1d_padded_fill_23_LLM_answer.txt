You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

input: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 7}

Example_2:

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change if they are separated by a certain number of background pixels that is specific to the example; this gap seems to be related to the color value of the objects
overall pattern: for any input, objects of the same color merge into a larger object if they are separated by background pixels where the number of background pixels is one less than the color value of the objects. The new size of the merged object is equal to the original size of the two objects plus the number of background pixels between them



transformation steps: ['1. Scan the input sequence from left to right and identify all objects.', '2. For each object, check the number of background pixels separating it from the next object of the same color.', '3. If the number of background pixels between two objects of the same color is exactly one less than the color value, merge the two objects.', '4. The new size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', '5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no further mergers are possible.', '6. The output sequence should reflect the merged objects with updated start and end indices, and sizes, while maintaining the original color value.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color merge into a larger object when they are separated by a number of background pixels equal to the size of the objects minus one. The merged object includes the original objects and the separating background pixels
overall pattern: Pairs of objects of the same color that are separated by a number of background pixels that is exactly one less than their size are merged into a single object that includes the separating background pixels. The color remains the same and the size is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that were in between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, determine if there is an adjacent object of the same color.', 'Check if the number of background pixels between two adjacent objects of the same color is equal to the size of the objects minus one.', 'If the condition is met, merge the two objects and the separating background pixels into a single object.', 'The start index of the merged object is the start index of the first object.', 'The end index of the merged object is the end index of the second object.', 'The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that were in between them.', 'Repeat the merge process for any additional objects that meet the conditions.', 'The color of the merged object remains the same as the original objects.', 'Update the output sequence to reflect the merged objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 36], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change if they are separated by a certain number of background pixels that is specific to the example; this gap seems to be related to the color value of the objects
overall pattern: for any input, objects of the same color merge into a larger object if they are separated by background pixels where the number of background pixels is one less than the color value of the objects. The new size of the merged object is equal to the original size of the two objects plus the number of background pixels between them


transformation steps: ['1. Scan the input sequence from left to right and identify all objects.', '2. For each object, check the number of background pixels separating it from the next object of the same color.', '3. If the number of background pixels between two objects of the same color is exactly one less than the color value, merge the two objects.', '4. The new size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', '5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no further mergers are possible.', '6. The output sequence should reflect the merged objects with updated start and end indices, and sizes, while maintaining the original color value.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 36],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 34, 'end_index': 34, 'size': 1}

conditions: objects change if they are separated by a certain number of background pixels that is specific to the example; this gap seems to be related to the color value of the objects
overall pattern: for any input, objects of the same color merge into a larger object if they are separated by background pixels where the number of background pixels is one less than the color value of the objects. The new size of the merged object is equal to the original size of the two objects plus the number of background pixels between them


transformation steps: ['1. Scan the input sequence from left to right and identify all objects.', '2. For each object, check the number of background pixels separating it from the next object of the same color.', '3. If the number of background pixels between two objects of the same color is exactly one less than the color value, merge the two objects.', '4. The new size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', '5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no further mergers are possible.', '6. The output sequence should reflect the merged objects with updated start and end indices, and sizes, while maintaining the original color value.']

input: Dimension: [1, 36],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 34, 'end_index': 34, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
