The input was scanned and objects were identified with their respective color, start_index, end_index, and size. Objects were grouped by their color, which in this case is only color 1. The object with the largest size, Object_2 with size 15, was correctly identified and kept. All other objects of the same color were marked for removal. The output sequence was then generated by including only the largest object for color 1 and filling the rest of the sequence with the background color (0).
