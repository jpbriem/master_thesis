The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 17}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects are shifted to the right by a number of indices. This shift is determined by the size of the object minus a constant value. The constant value is the same across all examples when compared to the shift.\noverall pattern: The general rule to transform any input into its output based on the input seems to be: for each object, maintain its color and size, and shift its position to the right by a number of indices equal to the size of the object minus a constant value. The constant value is derived from the size of the object and the amount of shift observed.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer to the input object's color, start index, end index, and size, which are relevant to determine the object changes in the output.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output as a shift to the right by the size of the object minus a constant value.
