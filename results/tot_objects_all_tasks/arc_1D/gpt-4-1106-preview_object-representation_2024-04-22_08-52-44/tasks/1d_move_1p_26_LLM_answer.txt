You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 15}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 8}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects move right by 1 position regardless of their color, position, or size
overall pattern: For any input, move each object right by 1 position, increasing start and end indices by 1, keeping the size unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify the start and end index of each object in the input sequence', 'Increment the start index of each object by 1', 'Increment the end index of each object by 1', 'Ensure the size of each object remains the same after the transformation', 'Shift the object to the right by filling the previous start index with 0 (background color)', 'Update the output sequence with the new positions of the objects']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 22}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 30]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 22}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were followed correctly for the given test case. The object's start index was incremented by 1 from 1 to 2, the end index was incremented by 1 from 22 to 23, and the object's size remained the same at 22. The object was shifted to the right, and the previous start index was likely filled with 0, maintaining the input dimension of [1, 30].",

------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output for the given input seems to follow the overall pattern and transformation steps correctly. The object in the input sequence, which is of color 1 and occupies the indices from 1 to 22, was expected to move right by 1 position. The start and end indices in the output are incremented by 1, resulting in a new start index of 2 and end index of 23. The size of the object remains the same, which is 22. No issues with the size or color of the object are observed. The transformation steps appear to have been applied correctly. The previous start index at 1 has been filled with 0, which aligns with the instructions to shift the object to the right by filling the previous start index with the background color.",
  "value": 10
