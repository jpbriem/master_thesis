For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects of size 1 increase in size to 3 and move one position to the left, provided there is sufficient space between them and the preceding object\noverall pattern: For objects of size 1, increase their size to 3 and shift their position one step towards the start index of the preceding object\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1, check the distance between its start index and the end index of the preceding object.', 'If there is at least one pixel of space between the object of size 1 and the preceding object, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, no transformation occurs for this object.', 'Increase the size of the object of size 1 to 3 by adding one pixel with the same color to both sides of the object.', 'Shift the start and end index of the newly sized object one position to the left (towards the start index of the preceding object).', 'Repeat the above steps for each object of size 1 in the sequence.', 'Output the transformed sequence, ensuring all other objects and pixels remain unchanged.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.
