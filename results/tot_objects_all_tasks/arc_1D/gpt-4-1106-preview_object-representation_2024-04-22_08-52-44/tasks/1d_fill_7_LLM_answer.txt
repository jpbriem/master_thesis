You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects:

	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.

output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 17}

output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: when there are multiple objects of the same color, they merge into a single object
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color, keep the start_index of the first object, and extend the end_index to that of the last object of the same color; the size of the new object becomes the inclusive range between the start_index and end_index


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the input sequence.', 'Record the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the last object of this color.', 'Create a new object with the same color.', 'Set the start_index of the new object to the recorded start_index of the first object.', 'Set the end_index of the new object to the recorded end_index of the last object.', 'The size of the new object is calculated as the difference between the new end_index and the start_index plus one, to account for the inclusive range.', 'Replace the original objects with the new merged object in the output sequence.', 'Fill all intermediate indices between the new start_index and end_index with the color of the merged objects.', 'Ensure all other pixels remain the same as in the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output:

transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
