The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The input had two objects of the same color: 7. The transformation steps require merging these objects into a single object, which the test output shows. The new object starts at the start index of the first object (10) and ends at the end index of the last object (14). The size of the new object is the end index minus the start index plus one, which is 5, correctly reflecting the range of indices the new object covers. The dimension of the output sequence remains the same as the input sequence.\", \"value\": 10}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}.

Regardless of the initial size of the objects, they merge to form a single object.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color and merge them into a single object. This new object will retain the color of the original objects and extend from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object, covering the entire range between them.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all the objects in the input sequence.', 'Check the color of each identified object to find objects with matching colors.', 'For each set of objects with the same color, determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object.', 'Create a new object with the same color as the original objects, with the start index from step 3 and an end index that covers all indices between the first and last original objects, inclusive.', 'Replace the original objects and any background pixels between them with the new object, forming a continuous sequence of pixels of the same color.', \"Ensure that the new object's size is equal to the distance from the new start index to the new end index plus one.\", 'Retain the original dimension of the input sequence for the output sequence.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 25]\ntransformed objects: [{'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 5}]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output correctly identifies a single transformed object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object, inclusive.
