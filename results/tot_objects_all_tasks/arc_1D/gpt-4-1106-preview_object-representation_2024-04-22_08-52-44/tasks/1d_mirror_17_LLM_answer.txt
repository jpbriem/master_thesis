You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The presence of an object with color 9 in the input sequence is a key condition for the transformation. This object does not change position.
overall pattern: For all objects that are not color 9, they retain their original size, move to the right side of the object with color 9, and have their colors changed to color 9. The object that initially had color 9 changes its color to that of the first object to its left. The position where the non-color-9 objects are placed seems to be at a fixed offset from the color 9 object's position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 9}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their color and size. A single-pixel object of color 9 remains stationary, while the other object swaps its color with the color of the single-pixel object and moves to a new start index that is determined by the position of the single-pixel object plus the size of the multi-pixel object divided by 2, rounded down if necessary.
overall pattern: For any input, identify the single-pixel object of color 9 and any other object. Swap their colors. The single-pixel object remains stationary. The multi-pixel object moves its start index to the position directly after the single-pixel object plus half of its size, rounded down if needed. The size of the objects does not change.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 9}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their color and size. A single-pixel object of color 9 remains stationary, while the other object swaps its color with the color of the single-pixel object and moves to a new start index that is determined by the position of the single-pixel object plus the size of the multi-pixel object divided by 2, rounded down if necessary.
overall pattern: For any input, identify the single-pixel object of color 9 and any other object. Swap their colors. The single-pixel object remains stationary. The multi-pixel object moves its start index to the position directly after the single-pixel object plus half of its size, rounded down if needed. The size of the objects does not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify the single-pixel object of color 9 within the input sequence.', 'Identify the multi-pixel object(s) within the input sequence.', 'Swap the color of the multi-pixel object(s) with the color of the single-pixel object of color 9.', 'Calculate the new start index for the multi-pixel object(s) by adding the index of the single-pixel object to half the size of the multi-pixel object, rounding down if necessary.', 'Move the multi-pixel object(s) to the calculated start index within the sequence.', 'Keep the single-pixel object of color 9 at its original position.', 'Ensure the size of the multi-pixel object(s) remains unchanged after the transformation.', 'All other pixels in the sequence that are not part of an identified object should remain as the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Adding this to the index of the single-pixel object, which is 15, should result in a new start index of 19 for the multi-pixel object. The end index of this object should be 19 + 7 (since size is 8), which is 26. The output correctly identifies the new start and end indexes for the multi-pixel object. However, the color of the single-pixel object should have been swapped to color 2 and its position should have remained the same, which is 15. The size of each object remains unchanged, which is consistent with the transformation rules. All non-object pixels seem to have been correctly kept at the background color (0).",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 7}

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 9}

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: The pattern involves swapping colors between the two objects and moving Object_1 to the right of Object_2. Object_2 seems to act as a pivot or anchor point, maintaining its position. The size of the objects does not change during the transformation
overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify Object_1 and Object_2. Swap their colors, move Object_1 to the right side of Object_2 without changing its size, ensure Object_2 remains in its original position, and adjust the indices accordingly


transformation steps: ['Identify Object_1 and Object_2 in the input sequence.', 'Swap the colors between Object_1 and Object_2.', 'Retain the position of Object_2 (do not move Object_2).', 'Move Object_1 to the immediate right of Object_2 without changing its size.', 'Update the start_index and end_index of Object_1 to reflect its new position.', 'Fill the original position of Object_1 with background color (0).', 'Ensure that the sequence maintains the same dimension by adjusting the positions of background pixels if necessary.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
