You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern: Each object moves right by 1 position


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object, move its entire range of indices one position to the right.', 'This includes updating the start_index and end_index of each object by adding 1 to their current values.', 'If the object reaches the end of the sequence, ensure that the sequence dimension is respected and that no pixels overflow beyond the dimension limit.', 'Maintain the size of each object; no scaling occurs.', 'Maintain the color of each object; no recoloring occurs.', 'No new objects are created, and no existing objects are removed or split during the transformation.', 'Adjust the background pixels accordingly to fill in the space where the object was originally located and to ensure that the background remains continuous.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 14}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 26]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 14}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test case output seems to follow the transformation steps correctly. Each step is addressed as follows: 1) The object in the input sequence is correctly identified. 2) The entire range of the object's indices has been moved one position to the right, as indicated by the change in both 'start_index' and 'end_index'. 3) The 'start_index' and 'end_index' of the object have been incremented by 1. 4) The object does not overflow beyond the dimension limit after the transformation. 5) The size of the object remains the same, indicating no scaling occurred. 6) The color of the object remains unchanged, indicating no recoloring occurred. 7) There are no new objects created, nor existing objects removed or split. 8) The background pixels are adjusted accordingly to maintain a continuous background and fill the space where the object originally was. Therefore, the transformation appears to be applied correctly.", "value": 10}

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input is a sequence with a single object, which follows the same structure as outlined in the examples. The object has a color value of 7, starts at index 6, ends at index 19, and has a size of 14. According to the transformation pattern, objects should move right by 1 position. In the test output, Object_1's start_index has been correctly increased from 6 to 7, and the end_index has also been correctly increased from 19 to 20, indicating a shift to the right by 1 position. The size of the object remains the same at 14, which is consistent with the transformation steps that specify maintaining the size of each object. The color of the object has also stayed the same, which is correct as per the pattern. No new objects are created, and the dimension limit has been respected with no overflow beyond the sequence limit of 26. The background pixels have been adjusted correctly to fill the space where the object was originally located. Based on the provided transformation steps, the test input has been transformed correctly into the test output.",
