The second object, which is of color 7, remains unchanged in all cases.\noverall pattern: The general rule for transformation is to extend the size of the first object until it is adjacent to the second object. The second object acts as a delimiter and does not change in size, color, or position. The first object retains its original color and start_index but has its end_index adjusted to be directly before the start_index of the second object.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the first and second objects in the input sequence.', 'Calculate the distance between the end_index of the first object and the start_index of the second object.', 'Extend the size of the first object by the calculated distance so that its end_index is now directly before the start_index of the second object.', 'Ensure the first object keeps its original color.', 'Ensure the second object remains unchanged in size, color, and position.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the updated first object and unchanged second object.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 22]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 20}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test input sequence has two objects. According to the transformation steps, the first object should be extended to the point where it is adjacent to the second object, without any gaps in between. Here, the first object originally ends at index 16 and the second object starts at index 21. The distance between the end index of the first object and the start index of the second object is 4. The test output shows that the first object's end index has been updated to 20, which extends the size of the first object by 4 pixels, making the end index directly before the start index of the second object at index 21. The size of the first object is correctly updated to 20. The second object remains unchanged with color 7, start index 21, end index 21, and size 1, which is in accordance with the overall pattern and transformation steps. The first object retains its original color of 2 and its original start index of 1. Thus, the transformation was applied correctly.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"The provided test output correctly follows the transformation steps outlined. The first object, originally with size 16, has its size increased by 4 pixels, making its new size 20. This extends the first object to have its end_index at 20, directly before the start_index of the second object at index 21. The second object remains unchanged in size, color, and position, with a size of 1, color 7, and position at index 21. The output dimension remains the same at [1, 22], and the overall transformation pattern has been correctly applied.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}"
