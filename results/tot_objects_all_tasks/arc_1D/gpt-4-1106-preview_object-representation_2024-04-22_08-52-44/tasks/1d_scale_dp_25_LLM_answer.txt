You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object expands to the right to fill in all background space until the next object is reached. This change is independent of its color and is determined by the distance to the next object
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the first object changes by expanding in size to the right until it reaches the next object. WHY it changes is to minimize the background space between objects, and HOW is by increasing the size of the first object to occupy the background pixels until the start index of the second object

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 21}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 17}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object expands to the right to fill in all background space until the next object is reached. This change is independent of its color and is determined by the distance to the next object
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the first object changes by expanding in size to the right until it reaches the next object. WHY it changes is to minimize the background space between objects, and HOW is by increasing the size of the first object to occupy the background pixels until the start index of the second object


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the sequence.', 'Determine the start index of the second object.', 'Calculate the number of background pixels between the end index of the first object and the start index of the second object.', 'Expand the first object by filling in all the background pixels with the color of the first object until reaching the pixel immediately before the start index of the second object.', 'Adjust the end index of the first object to the new position after expansion.', 'Ensure the second object and any subsequent objects remain unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 23],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 23],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 23]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output shows an attempt to apply the transformation pattern to the input sequence. In this case, Object_1 is expected to expand to the right, filling in the background space until it reaches the start index of Object_2. The start index of Object_1 is 6, and the end index is 18, with the size being 13 indicating that it occupies the pixels from index 6 to 18. Object_2 starts at index 21 and occupies that single pixel. According to the overall pattern, Object_1 should expand from its original end index of 18 to one pixel before the start index of Object_2, which is index 20. The output correctly shows Object_1's end index at 20 and the size adjusted to 15, which includes the original 13 pixels plus the 2 background pixels that were filled. Object_2 remains the same as per the transformation steps. The transformation was correctly applied to Object_1 without affecting Object_2.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has correctly identified the first object and its color. However, the end index of the first object after transformation should be 20, which is one index before the start index of the second object (21), as per the given transformation steps. The size of the first object should therefore be 15, calculated as the end index (20) minus the start index (6) plus one. The second object's position and size remain unchanged. The test output follows the overall pattern and transformation steps accurately.",
