You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

conditions: The first object changes if it is not single-sized. Single-sized objects remain unchanged. The change in the first object's size appears to be determined by the sequence length and the position of the last object.
overall pattern: For any given input, if the first object is not single-sized, increase its size to extend to the second to last occupied position in the sequence. Keep the color and starting position the same. Single-sized objects do not change. This results in the first object being expanded to fill the available space up to one position before the last object.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object changes by expanding its size to fill the space leaving a single pixel gap before the second object. The color and position of the first object remain the same. The second object does not change.
overall pattern: For any input, expand the size of the first object to fill up the space leaving exactly one pixel gap before the second object. The color and starting index of the first object do not change. The second object remains unchanged.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}

input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object changes if it is not single-sized. Single-sized objects remain unchanged. The change in the first object's size appears to be determined by the sequence length and the position of the last object.
overall pattern: For any given input, if the first object is not single-sized, increase its size to extend to the second to last occupied position in the sequence. Keep the color and starting position the same. Single-sized objects do not change. This results in the first object being expanded to fill the available space up to one position before the last object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first non-single-sized object in the sequence.', 'Determine the position of the last pixel of the second object in the sequence.', 'Extend the size of the first object so that it ends one position before the start of the second object.', 'Maintain the color of the first object and its starting position.', 'Leave single-sized objects and all subsequent objects unchanged.']

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object changes by expanding its size to fill the space leaving a single pixel gap before the second object. The color and position of the first object remain the same. The second object does not change.
overall pattern: For any input, expand the size of the first object to fill up the space leaving exactly one pixel gap before the second object. The color and starting index of the first object do not change. The second object remains unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first and second objects in the sequence.', 'Calculate the new end_index for the first object by subtracting 2 from the start_index of the second object.', 'Expand the first object to the new end_index, filling all intermediate pixels with the color of the first object.', 'Ensure the second object stays the same with its original color, start_index, and size.', 'Generate the output sequence with the transformed first object and the unchanged second object.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 10],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:

overall pattern: For any given input, if the first object is not single-sized, increase its size to extend to the second to last occupied position in the sequence. Keep the color and starting position the same. Single-sized objects do not change. This results in the first object being expanded to fill the available space up to one position before the last object.
