The size of the objects remains unchanged during the swap.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify two objects where at least one of them is color 9. Swap the positions and colors of these two objects, keeping the size of the objects the same as in the input sequence. All other aspects of the sequence remain unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Check if one of the objects has the color 9.', 'Record the position and size of both objects.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects, ensuring that the object with color 9 takes the color of the other object and vice versa.', 'Place the object that previously had color 9 (now with the new color) in the position of the second object while maintaining its original size.', 'Place the second object (now with color 9) in the original position of the first object while maintaining its original size.', 'Keep all other pixels in the sequence unchanged.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 26],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers\ntransformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test case output dimension and transformed objects are missing.
