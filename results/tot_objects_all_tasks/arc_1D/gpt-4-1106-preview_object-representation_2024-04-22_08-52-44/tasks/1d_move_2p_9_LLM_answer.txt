You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, the objects change in position but not in size or color. The shift in position is consistent, with each object moving 2 indices to the right.
overall pattern: The general rule for transforming any input into its output is to move each object exactly 2 indices to the right without altering the color or size of the object. This transformation applies to all objects irrespective of their individual characteristics.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', "For each object, increment the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 2, effectively moving the object 2 positions to the right.", 'Maintain the color and size of each object during the transformation.', 'Ensure that no overlaps of objects occur as a result of the shift.', 'Fill any gaps created by the move with the background color (0).']

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 10}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move regardless of their color, position, or size
overall pattern: Each object moves 2 positions to the right while retaining its original color and size


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, shift the start_index 2 positions to the right.', 'For each object, shift the end_index 2 positions to the right.', 'Ensure that the size of the object remains unchanged.', 'Retain the original color of each object.', "Fill the positions between the new start_index and end_index with the object's color.", 'Retain the background color (0) for all other positions.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 14}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 14}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were correctly applied to the test case. The object in the input sequence had a color of 2 and spanned from index 5 to 18 with a size of 14. According to the transformation pattern, each object moves 2 positions to the right while retaining its original color and size. The test output shows that the object now starts at index 7 and ends at index 20, which is exactly 2 positions to the right for both the start and end indices. The size of the object remains 14, and the color remains 2, which adheres to the transformation rules. There are no instructions indicating that the size of the sequence should change or that the background color should be altered, so the background remains 0 as expected.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation steps correctly. The object identified in the input sequence has color 2, starts at index 5, ends at index 18, and has a size of 14. According to the transformation steps, the object should move 2 positions to the right while retaining its original color and size. The test output shows that Object_1 now starts at index 7 and ends at index 20, which is exactly 2 positions to the right for both start and end indices. The size remains 14, as the difference between the end_index and start_index plus one is equal to the size, and the color is unchanged at 2. The background color remains 0 as there's no indication of any change in the background color in the test output. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.",
