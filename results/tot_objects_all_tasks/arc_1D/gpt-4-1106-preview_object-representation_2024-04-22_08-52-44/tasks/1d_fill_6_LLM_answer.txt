You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 22}

output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs when there are exactly two objects of the same color. The first object expands its size to connect with the second object, regardless of the distance between them. The second object is then subsumed into the first
overall pattern: Identify pairs of objects with the same color. Extend the size of the first object to span the distance from its start_index to the end_index of the second object. The second object is then removed, as it becomes part of the first object. This rule applies only if there are exactly two objects of the same color in the sequence



transformation steps: ['Identify the first object (Object_1) and the second object (Object_2) of the same color within the input sequence.', "Set the 'end_index' of Object_1 to the 'end_index' of Object_2.", "Calculate the new size for Object_1 by subtracting the 'start_index' of Object_1 from the 'end_index' of Object_2 and adding 1.", "Fill all indices between the 'end_index' of Object_1 and the 'start_index' of Object_2 with the color of the objects.", 'Remove Object_2 from the sequence, as it is now part of Object_1.']

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 22}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 22}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation occurs when there are exactly two objects of the same color. The first object expands its size to connect with the second object, regardless of the distance between them. The second object is then subsumed into the first
overall pattern: Identify pairs of objects with the same color. Extend the size of the first object to span the distance from its start_index to the end_index of the second object. The second object is then removed, as it becomes part of the first object. This rule applies only if there are exactly two objects of the same color in the sequence


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object (Object_1) and the second object (Object_2) of the same color within the input sequence.', "Set the 'end_index' of Object_1 to the 'end_index' of Object_2.", "Calculate the new size for Object_1 by subtracting the 'start_index' of Object_1 from the 'end_index' of Object_2 and adding 1.", "Fill all indices between the 'end_index' of Object_1 and the 'start_index' of Object_2 with the color of the objects.", 'Remove Object_2 from the sequence, as it is now part of Object_1.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 27],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
