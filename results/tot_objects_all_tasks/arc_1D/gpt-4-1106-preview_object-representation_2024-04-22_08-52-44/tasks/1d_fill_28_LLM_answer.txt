You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Whenever there are multiple objects of the same color, they merge into a single object extending from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with the same color. Merge these objects into one by keeping the start index of the first object and extending its size to reach the end index of the last object of the same color. This rule applies regardless of the distance between the objects.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence. An object is defined as a sequence of adjacent pixels of the same color that is not the background color.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, find the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object.', 'Create a new object that has the same color as the group, starting at the start index of the first object and ending at the end index of the last object, effectively merging all objects of the same color into one continuous object.', 'Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the newly created merged object, filling all intermediate pixels with the same color.', 'Remove any remaining isolated objects of the same color that were not part of the initial group, as they have been merged into the new object.', 'The output sequence should now contain the merged objects, with the background color (0s) in all other positions not covered by the merged objects.']

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Whenever there are multiple objects of the same color, they merge into a single object extending from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with the same color. Merge these objects into one by keeping the start index of the first object and extending its size to reach the end index of the last object of the same color. This rule applies regardless of the distance between the objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence. An object is defined as a sequence of adjacent pixels of the same color that is not the background color.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, find the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object.', 'Create a new object that has the same color as the group, starting at the start index of the first object and ending at the end index of the last object, effectively merging all objects of the same color into one continuous object.', 'Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the newly created merged object, filling all intermediate pixels with the same color.', 'Remove any remaining isolated objects of the same color that were not part of the initial group, as they have been merged into the new object.', 'The output sequence should now contain the merged objects, with the background color (0s) in all other positions not covered by the merged objects.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 9],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 9]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output appears to correctly follow the transformation steps. The initial input had two objects of the same color, 7, positioned at indices 0 and 4, each of size 1. Following the transformation rules, these two objects should be merged into one continuous object stretching from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object. The output shows a single object of color 7, starting at index 0 and ending at index 4, with a size of 5, which is exactly what is expected based on the overall pattern and transformation steps. All intermediate pixels between the original objects have been correctly filled with the color 7, and the object has been properly extended to connect the two original objects. There are no isolated objects of the same color remaining, and the background color is correctly maintained in all other positions.",

}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output shows a transformation where two objects of the same color (color 7) have been merged into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps provided, this merging of objects is the expected behavior. The original objects had start and end indices at positions 0 and 4, respectively. The merged object correctly starts at index 0 and ends at index 4, and has a size of 5, which covers the entire range from the first to the last object, inclusive. This is consistent with the examples provided and follows the transformation rules correctly. There are no other objects of color 7 that would have been left isolated, so no additional steps are required. The transformation seems to have been applied correctly.", "value": 10}
