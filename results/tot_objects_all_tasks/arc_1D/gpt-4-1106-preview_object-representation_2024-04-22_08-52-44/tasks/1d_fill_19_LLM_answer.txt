You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, locate objects of the same color and merge them into a single object, expanding the size to cover the range from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence', 'For each group of objects with the same color, determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object', 'Create a new object of the same color that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object', 'The size of the new object is the difference between the end index of the last object and the start index of the first object plus one', 'Replace the original objects with the new merged object in the output sequence', 'Ensure that all pixels between the start and end index of the new object are of the same color as the objects being merged', "The background pixels (value 0) that were between the original objects should now be colored with the object's color", 'If there are any non-adjacent objects of different colors, they remain unchanged']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 6}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color change regardless of their size or the distance between them
overall pattern: For any input, to transform it into its output, merge all objects of the same color into a single object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the last object of that color



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence', 'Group objects by their color', 'For each group of objects with the same color, find the smallest start index and the largest end index', 'Create a new object for each color group where the start index is the smallest start index found and the end index is the largest end index found from step 3', 'The size of the new object is the difference between the new end index and start index plus one', 'Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the new objects', "Ensure that the pixels between the new start index and end index of the new object are set to the object's color", 'Remove any remaining pixels of the same color that are outside the range of the new start and end indices', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged']

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color change regardless of their size or the distance between them
overall pattern: For any input, to transform it into its output, merge all objects of the same color into a single object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the last object of that color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence', 'Group objects by their color', 'For each group of objects with the same color, find the smallest start index and the largest end index', 'Create a new object for each color group where the start index is the smallest start index found and the end index is the largest end index found from step 3', 'The size of the new object is the difference between the new end index and start index plus one', 'Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the new objects', "Ensure that the pixels between the new start index and end index of the new object are set to the object's color", 'Remove any remaining pixels of the same color that are outside the range of the new start and end indices', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 11],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 11]
transformed objects: [{'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 6}]
