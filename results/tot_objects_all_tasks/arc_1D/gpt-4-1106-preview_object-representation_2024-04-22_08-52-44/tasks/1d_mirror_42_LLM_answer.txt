You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

The color of the first object is correctly changed to match the color of the second object (from 6 to 9). However, there is an issue with the position of the second object in the test output. Based on the transformation pattern, the second object should move to the right by a number of positions equal to the size of the first object minus one (5 - 1 = 4). The original start index of the second object is 9, so adding 4 to this should result in a new start index of 13. The test output correctly places the start index of the second object at 13. However, the color of the second object in the test output is incorrect; it should retain its original color (9), but instead it has been changed to the original color of the first object (6). Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the size of the second object; it should have a size of 1, and the test output correctly represents this, but the end index should be the same as the start index (13), not different as listed in the test output (13).

  "test_output_analysis": "The test output partially follows the transformation steps outlined. According to the pattern, the colors of the two objects should be swapped, which was done correctly. Object_1 originally had color 6 and became color 9 in the output. Object_2 went from color 9 to color 6. However, the positions of the objects after the transformation do not align with the instructions. Object_1, which starts at index 3 and has a size of 5, should be moved to the right by its size plus 1, which means it should start at index 3 + 5 + 1 = 9. Instead, Object_1 starts at index 9, which is correct based on the transformation pattern. However, Object_2, which is a single pixel, should move right by the size of the first object minus its own size (5 - 1 = 4). It should start at index 9 + 4 = 13. The end_index of Object_2 is correctly placed at 13, but it should be the start_index instead of the end_index. The size of Object_2 is correct, but its start_index and end_index should both be 13 as it represents a single pixel, and its current representation suggests it spans multiple pixels. Hence, the transformation was not applied correctly.",

    "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not follow the transformation steps correctly. According to the transformation rules, the first object should move right by its size plus 1, which is 5 + 1 = 6. Therefore, Object_1 should have started at index 3 + 6 = 9. However, the test output shows the first object starting at index 9, which is correct. Its end index should be 9 + 5 - 1 = 13, which matches the test output. The second object should move to the right by the size of the first object minus its own size, which is 5 - 1 = 4. Therefore, Object_2 should have started at index 9 + 4 = 13. This is consistent with the test output. However, the second object's end index should also be 13, as its size is 1, and this is correctly represented in the test output. While the starting position of Object_1 is accurate, it seems there was a misunderstanding about the movement of Object_2 in the instructions. The starting position for Object_2 is correct, but the instructions may have been misinterpreted, leading to the correct output by coincidence rather than by following the steps exactly as described.",
