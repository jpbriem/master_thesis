For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: the pattern applies to objects of any color and size, and it does not matter where the object starts within the sequence\noverall pattern: the general rule is to transform any object into two objects of the same color, both of size 1, located at the original object's start and end indices, regardless of the object's initial size or position\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the start and end indices of the object within the input sequence.', 'Transform the object into two new objects, both having the same color as the original object.', 'Place the first new object at the original start index of the original object, with a size of 1.', 'Place the second new object at the original end index of the original object, with a size of 1.', 'Fill all indices between the new objects with the background color (0).']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
