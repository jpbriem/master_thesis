For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 16}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 16}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 7}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 20}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 20}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: All objects move to the right by 3 units regardless of their color, initial position, or size\noverall pattern: For any input sequence, move each object in the sequence to the right by 3 units without altering the color or size of the object\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence based on adjacent pixels of the same color.', \"For each identified object, increment the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 3 units.\", 'Maintain the color and size of each object.', 'Shift the object within the array, filling the old positions with 0 (background color) and ensuring the new positions are updated with the correct color.', 'Ensure the dimension of the output sequence remains the same as the input sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
