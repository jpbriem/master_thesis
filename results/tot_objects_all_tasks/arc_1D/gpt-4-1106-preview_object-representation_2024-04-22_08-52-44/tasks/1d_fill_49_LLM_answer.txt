You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are merged if they have the same color and are separated by background pixels
overall pattern: For any input sequence, find all objects of the same color that are not adjacent and merge them into one object, spanning from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color, irrespective of the number of background pixels between them



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color:', '  - Find the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object in the group.', '  - Create a new object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object.', '  - Assign the common color to the new object.', '  - Replace the original objects with the new merged object in the sequence.', "  - Fill the background pixels within the new object's range with the object's color.", 'Ensure the dimension of the output sequence is the same as the input sequence.']

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

However, the size should actually be the number of pixels occupied by color 4, which after the transformation should include the background pixel between them, resulting in a size of 3. The size is correctly stated as 3, but the output does not mention filling in the background pixel with the object's color as per the transformation step 8. This suggests that the instructions might have been followed correctly, but the description of the transformed object is incomplete as it does not specify that the background pixel has been filled with the object's color.",

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}

output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are merged if they have the same color and are separated by background pixels
overall pattern: For any input sequence, find all objects of the same color that are not adjacent and merge them into one object, spanning from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color, irrespective of the number of background pixels between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'For each group of objects with the same color:', '  - Find the start index of the first object and the end index of the last object in the group.', '  - Create a new object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object.', '  - Assign the common color to the new object.', '  - Replace the original objects with the new merged object in the sequence.', "  - Fill the background pixels within the new object's range with the object's color.", 'Ensure the dimension of the output sequence is the same as the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 10],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 10]
