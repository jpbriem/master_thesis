For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects larger than size 1 are transformed. The color or the position in the sequence does not seem to be a factor in the transformation\noverall pattern: For each object with a size larger than 1, create two new objects of the same color and a size of 1. Place one object at the original start_index and the other at the original end_index of the original object. Remove the intermediate pixels of the original object\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence with a size larger than 1.', 'For each identified object, create two new objects of the same color.', 'Set the size of each new object to 1.', 'Place the first new object at the start_index of the original object.', 'Place the second new object at the end_index of the original object.', 'Remove all pixels between the new objects that belonged to the original object, effectively hollowing it out and leaving only the start and end pixels.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
