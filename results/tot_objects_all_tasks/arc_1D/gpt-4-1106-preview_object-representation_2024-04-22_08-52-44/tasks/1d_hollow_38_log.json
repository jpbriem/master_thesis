The transformation is consistent across all examples.\noverall pattern: For any given object, create two new objects of the same color. Each new object has a size of 1 and is placed at the start and end index of the original object. All parts of the original object between the new objects are removed, leaving only the first and last pixel of the original object.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object, note the color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Create a new object of the same color at the start_index of the original object with a size of 1 pixel.', 'Create a second new object of the same color at the end_index of the original object with a size of 1 pixel.', \"Remove all the pixels of the original object that are between the new objects' positions.\", 'Repeat the above steps for each object in the input sequence.', \"The output sequence should maintain the same overall dimension as the input sequence, with background color pixels (0) filling the spaces where the original object's middle pixels were removed.\"]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 14}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 15}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: all objects regardless of size, color, or position undergo the same change\noverall pattern: each object is transformed by keeping only the first and last pixel of the original object and removing the rest\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence. An object is defined by a contiguous set of non-zero pixels of the same color.', \"For each identified object, locate the first and last pixel of the object. These are the pixels at the 'start_index' and 'end_index' positions respectively.\", 'Remove all pixels of the object except for the first and last pixels. This is done by setting all intermediate pixels to zero, which represents the background color.', 'The result is a sequence where each original object is represented by only two pixels: the first and the last, with the background color filling the spaces between and within the original objects.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
