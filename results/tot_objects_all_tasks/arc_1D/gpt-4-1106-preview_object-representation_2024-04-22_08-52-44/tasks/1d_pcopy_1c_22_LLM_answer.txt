You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to single-pixel objects (size of 1). These objects are scaled up to match the size of the largest object in the input sequence. If there are no larger objects, they remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, find the largest object size in the input sequence. Then, for each object with a size of 1, scale it up to match the largest size found. Shift the position of these scaled objects to the left by one index to accommodate their new size while maintaining a one-pixel gap between subsequent objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to any object of size 1, regardless of its color. The condition for the transformation is that the object must be of size 1.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, objects of size 1 should be transformed into objects of size 3, keeping their color unchanged, and their starting position should be shifted one index to the left. Objects that are already of size 3 or any other size remain unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects with size 1 change to size 3
overall pattern: for each object in the input, if the object size is 1, increase the size to 3 by adding one pixel of the same color to both the start and end of the object. Other objects remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Iterate over each object in the input sequence', 'Check the size of the current object', 'If the size of the object equals 1:', '  - Add one pixel of the same color to the left (decrease start_index by 1)', '  - Add one pixel of the same color to the right (increase end_index by 1)', 'If the size of the object is greater than 1, do not alter the object', 'Proceed to the next object in the sequence', 'After processing all objects, the output sequence is complete']


Test case:

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to any object of size 1, regardless of its color. The condition for the transformation is that the object must be of size 1.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, objects of size 1 should be transformed into objects of size 3, keeping their color unchanged, and their starting position should be shifted one index to the left. Objects that are already of size 3 or any other size remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1, shift its starting index one position to the left.', 'Expand the identified object of size 1 to an object of size 3 by adding two pixels of the same color, one at its original position and one to the right of its original position.', 'Keep the color of the object the same during the transformation.', 'Any objects in the input sequence that are not of size 1 remain unchanged in the output sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to any object of size 1, regardless of its color. The condition for the transformation is that the object must be of size 1.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, objects of size 1 should be transformed into objects of size 3, keeping their color unchanged, and their starting position should be shifted one index to the left. Objects that are already of size 3 or any other size remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1, shift its starting index one position to the left.', 'Expand the identified object of size 1 to an object of size 3 by adding two pixels of the same color, one at its original position and one to the right of its original position.', 'Keep the color of the object the same during the transformation.', 'Any objects in the input sequence that are not of size 1 remain unchanged in the output sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 33]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}
