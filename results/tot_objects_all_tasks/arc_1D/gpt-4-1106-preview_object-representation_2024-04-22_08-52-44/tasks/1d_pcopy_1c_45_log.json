The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The first object was identified and left unchanged, as per the instructions. Each subsequent object, which was originally of size 1, was correctly scaled up to a size of 3. The start_index of each scaled object was adjusted to be two indices greater than the end_index of the previous object, maintaining the required gap. Object_2's start_index was correctly moved from 8 to 7, which is two indices greater than Object_1's end_index of 4. Similarly, Object_3's start_index was correctly moved from 12 to 11, and Object_4's start_index was moved from 16 to 15, both maintaining the two-index gap from the previous object's end_index. The size and color of the objects were preserved during the transformation, and the overall pattern was correctly applied.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
