You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color based on their size. There seems to be a threshold size that determines whether they change to color 6 or color 8. In these examples, objects of size 1, 3, and 5 change to color 8, while objects of size 2 (and possibly 4) change to color 6.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the size of each object. If the object size is 2, change its color to 6. If the object size is 1, 3, or 5, change its color to 8. It is unclear what happens with other sizes, but if there is a pattern, it may be that even sizes change to color 6 and odd sizes change to color 8.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation of objects from input to output is determined by the size of the objects. If the size is a prime number, the object changes to color 8. If the size is not a prime number, the object changes to color 6.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, evaluate the size of each object. If the size is a prime number (1, 2, 3, 5, 7...), recolor the object to 8. If the size is not a prime number (4, 6, 8, 9...), recolor the object to 6. The position and size of the objects remain unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Check if the size of the object is a prime number.', 'If the size is a prime number, recolor the object to color 8.', 'If the size is not a prime number, recolor the object to color 6.', 'Retain the original start_index, end_index, and size of each object.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the recolored objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation of objects from input to output is determined by the size of the objects. If the size is a prime number, the object changes to color 8. If the size is not a prime number, the object changes to color 6.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, evaluate the size of each object. If the size is a prime number (1, 2, 3, 5, 7...), recolor the object to 8. If the size is not a prime number (4, 6, 8, 9...), recolor the object to 6. The position and size of the objects remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Check if the size of the object is a prime number.', 'If the size is a prime number, recolor the object to color 8.', 'If the size is not a prime number, recolor the object to color 6.', 'Retain the original start_index, end_index, and size of each object.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the recolored objects.']

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the position of each object in the sequence (first object, second object, etc.).', 'Recolor all odd-positioned objects (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) to the color value of 6.', 'Recolor all even-positioned objects (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) to the color value of 8.', 'Maintain the size and position of all objects; only the color attribute is changed.', 'The background color (0) remains unchanged throughout the sequence.']

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, evaluate the size of each object. If the size is a prime number (1, 2, 3, 5, 7...), recolor the object to 8. If the size is not a prime number (4, 6, 8, 9...), recolor the object to 6. The position and size of the objects remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Check if the size of the object is a prime number.', 'If the size is a prime number, recolor the object to color 8.', 'If the size is not a prime number, recolor the object to color 6.', 'Retain the original start_index, end_index, and size of each object.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the recolored objects.']

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output did not follow the transformation pattern correctly. In the test input, there are five objects with sizes 3, 2, 2, 2, and 1 respectively. According to the pattern, objects with sizes that are prime numbers should be recolored to 8, and those with sizes that are not prime numbers should be recolored to 6. The sizes 3, 2, and 2 are prime numbers, so these objects should indeed be recolored to 8, which has been done correctly for Object_1, Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4. However, the size 1 is not considered a prime number; therefore, Object_5 should have been recolored to 8 instead of 6. The output incorrectly assigns color 6 to an object of size 1.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were not applied correctly to the test input. According to the overall pattern, objects of size 1 should be recolored to 8 since size 1 is considered a prime number based on the given examples. However, Object_5, which has a size of 1, was incorrectly recolored to 6 instead of 8. All other objects' sizes (3 and 2) are prime numbers and were correctly recolored to 8. The positions and sizes of the objects were retained correctly as per the transformation steps.",
