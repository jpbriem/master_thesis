You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the first object increases in size while the second object remains unchanged. The change in the first object's size seems to be fixed, leading to a new end_index of 15 regardless of the initial size or color.
overall pattern: The general rule to transform any input into its output: For the first object in the sequence, increase its size such that its end_index becomes 15. The color and initial position remain the same. The second object, if present, remains unchanged in color, position, and size.



transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the sequence', 'Change the end_index of the first object to 15 while keeping its start_index and color unchanged', 'Increase the size of the first object based on the new end_index', 'If a second object exists, keep its start_index, end_index, color, and size unchanged']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

overall pattern:
conditions: The larger object seems to expand to the right by filling the adjacent background pixels until it reaches a certain point or condition, while the smaller object remains the same. There seems to be a pattern where the first object expands to the right until it is separated from the second object by one background pixel.
overall pattern: For any input, the first (and larger) object will expand to the right by filling in the background pixels until it is separated from the second (and smaller) object by one background pixel. The second object will remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first and second objects in the input sequence.', 'Calculate the number of background pixels between the end of the first object and the start of the second object.', 'Expand the first object to the right by filling in the background pixels.', 'Stop the expansion when there is only one background pixel left between the first and second objects.', 'Keep the second and any subsequent objects unchanged in position and size.']

The correct output should have the first object's end_index at 15 without affecting the second object's position, which seems impossible in this test case due to the original positions of the objects. The test case output is incorrect because it does not properly handle the overlap of the two objects.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

conditions: The larger object seems to expand to the right by filling the adjacent background pixels until it reaches a certain point or condition, while the smaller object remains the same. There seems to be a pattern where the first object expands to the right until it is separated from the second object by one background pixel.
overall pattern: For any input, the first (and larger) object will expand to the right by filling in the background pixels until it is separated from the second (and smaller) object by one background pixel. The second object will remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first and second objects in the input sequence.', 'Calculate the number of background pixels between the end of the first object and the start of the second object.', 'Expand the first object to the right by filling in the background pixels.', 'Stop the expansion when there is only one background pixel left between the first and second objects.', 'Keep the second and any subsequent objects unchanged in position and size.']
