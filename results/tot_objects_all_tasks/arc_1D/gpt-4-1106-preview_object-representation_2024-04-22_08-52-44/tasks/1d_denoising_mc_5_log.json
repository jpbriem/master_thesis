The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

If there are any pixels within an object that do not match the majority color of that object, they are recolored to match the majority color.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify each object within the sequence. For each object, determine the majority color. Recolor any pixels within the object that do not match this majority color so that they do. The size and position of the objects remain unchanged; only the color uniformity is affected.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions are relevant as they relate to the transformation of objects based on the color majority within them.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output.
