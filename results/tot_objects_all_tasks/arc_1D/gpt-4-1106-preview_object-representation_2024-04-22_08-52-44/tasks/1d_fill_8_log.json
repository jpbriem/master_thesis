The two objects of color 6 in the input are turned into a single object in the output, spanning from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object. The size of the new object is correctly calculated as the distance from the first object's start_index to the second object's end_index inclusive, which is 14 positions long (from index 1 to index 14). The color remains unchanged at 6. This matches the overall pattern described, where the first object is extended to cover the range up to the second object's end_index, and the second object is removed.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
