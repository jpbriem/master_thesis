You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 66], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 44, 'end_index': 44, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 51, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Pairs of objects of the same color merge if they are separated by a consistent number of background pixels, which can be inferred from the examples provided
overall pattern: Identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a consistent number of background pixels, then merge each pair into one object by expanding the size to span from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, increasing the size to the sum of the original sizes plus the number of background pixels between them



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Check if there is an even number of objects for each color.', 'Group objects by color to form pairs (first with second, third with fourth, etc.).', 'For each pair, count the number of background pixels between the end index of the first object and the start index of the second object.', 'If the number of background pixels between objects of a pair is consistent with other pairs, proceed to merge.', "Merge each pair by extending the first object's size to cover the second object, including the background pixels between them.", 'The color of the merged object remains the same as the original objects.', 'The start index of the merged object is the start index of the first object in the pair.', 'The end index of the merged object is the end index of the second object in the pair.', 'The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', 'Remove the second object from the sequence as it is now part of the merged object.', 'Repeat the merging process for all pairs.', 'Leave all non-paired objects and background pixels unchanged.', 'Output the transformed sequence.']

conditions: objects of the same color combine when separated by exactly 6 background pixels
overall pattern: For each pair of objects with the same color, if they are separated by exactly 6 background pixels, they are combined into a single object.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color combine when separated by exactly 6 background pixels
overall pattern: For each pair of objects with the same color, if they are separated by exactly 6 background pixels, they are combined into a single object. The new object's start index is the start index of the first object, and the end index is the end index of the second object. The size of the new object is the sum of the two original sizes plus the 6 background pixels that were between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if there is another object of the same color exactly 7 pixels away (6 background pixels plus 1 pixel of the second object).', 'If such a pair of objects is found, create a new object with the following properties:', '  - The color of the new object is the same as the original objects.', '  - The start_index of the new object is the same as the start_index of the first object in the pair.', '  - The end_index of the new object is the same as the end_index of the second object in the pair.', '  - The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus 6 (the number of background pixels that were between them).', 'Remove the original pair of objects from the output sequence.', 'Repeat steps 2-5 for all objects until no more qualifying pairs are found.', 'Fill in the background pixels (0s) in the output sequence where objects have been combined.', 'The final output sequence should contain the newly formed objects and any remaining original objects that did not qualify for combination.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 66],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 61, 'end_index': 61, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 66]
transformed objects: No objects have been combined or transformed, so the output sequence contains the same objects as the input sequence: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 61, 'end_index': 61, 'size': 1}
