You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation applies to any object regardless of its color, position, or size
overall pattern: for each object in the input, keep only the first and last pixels and change the rest of the pixels in the object to background color, effectively splitting the original object into two objects of size 1 at the ends of the original object



transformation steps: ['Identify all the objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object identified, locate the first pixel (start_index) and the last pixel (end_index) of the object.', 'Change the value of all the pixels between the first and last pixel of each object to 0, which represents the background color.', 'The first pixel of the original object becomes the first and only pixel of the new Object_1.', 'The last pixel of the original object becomes the first and only pixel of the new Object_2.', 'Retain the original color of the first and last pixels, as they become the individual colors of the new objects.', 'Ensure that the rest of the sequence remains unchanged, preserving the background color for all indexes that are not the first or last pixel of an object.']

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation consistently applies to any single object regardless of color, position, or initial size
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify each object and change it by keeping only the first and last pixel of the original object and set the pixels in between to the background color


transformation steps: ['Iterate through the input sequence to identify each object based on color continuity (non-zero consecutive pixels).', 'For each identified object, record the color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Transform the object by keeping the pixel at the start_index and the pixel at the end_index of the original object, and set all other pixels of the object to the background color (0).', 'Leave all other pixels that were originally the background color unchanged.', 'Construct the output sequence with the transformed objects, ensuring they retain their original start and end positions within the sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 18}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly transformed the input into its output by following the overall pattern and transformation steps. The input object is of color 8, starting at index 6 and ending at index 23. According to the transformation steps, we should keep the pixels at the start_index and end_index of the object and change all other pixels of the object to the background color. The test output shows exactly this, with an object of color 8 at start_index 6 and another at end_index 23, each with a size of 1, and all other pixels of the object set to the background color. This aligns with the transformation pattern observed in the examples given.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly identifies the transformation pattern applied to the test input. The pattern consists of keeping only the first and last pixels of the object, while converting the intermediate pixels to the background color. The test input had one object of color 8 starting at index 6 and ending at index 23. The test output correctly transformed this object into two objects of the same color, each of size 1, positioned at the start and end indices of the original object. No intermediate pixels were left with the object's color, and they were correctly set to the background color. The transformation steps were accurately followed.", "value": 10}
