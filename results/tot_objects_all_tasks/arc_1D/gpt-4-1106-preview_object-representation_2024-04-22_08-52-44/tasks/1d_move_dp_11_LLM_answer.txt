You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation rules apply to larger objects in each sequence, which move to the right, while smaller objects do not move. The movement distance of the larger object correlates with its size.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Instead, the sequence should be truncated to fit the dimension constraint, with the end index at most 23, and the sequence filled with the background color (0) where necessary after the transformation. Furthermore, there should be zeroes padding from index 0 to 4, as the original object is moved to the right. Object_2 remains unchanged as specified, which is correct.",

input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size greater than 1 move to the right, while objects of size 1 remain in place.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move objects larger than size 1 to the right by a number of positions equal to their size plus 1. Objects of size 1 do not move.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object, check its size.', "If the object's size is greater than 1, calculate the number of positions to move by adding 1 to the object's size.", "Shift the object to the right by the calculated number of positions, ensuring that the object's color and size remain unchanged.", 'For any object of size 1, do not move it; keep it in its original position.', 'Fill in the gaps left by the moved objects with the background color, which is 0.', 'After all applicable objects have been moved, the sequence is now transformed into the output.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 24],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 20}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 24]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output is incorrect based on the transformation instructions. According to the pattern, objects of size greater than 1 should move to the right by the number of positions equal to their size plus 1. The input object of color 5 is of size 20, so it should move 21 positions to the right. However, the input sequence's total length is only 24, and moving the object 21 places to the right would exceed the sequence bounds. Thus, the object should actually be at indices 21 to 24, inclusive, and all preceding indices should be filled with the background color 0. The test output incorrectly states that the object of color 5 has a size of 4, but it should retain its original size of 20 after the transformation. The output also violates the sequence bounds, as index 24 is outside the allowed range for a sequence of length 24. The object of color 6 at size 1 is correctly not moved according to the transformation pattern.",

  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation of the test case input to the output is incorrect. According to the overall pattern, objects larger than size 1 should move to the right by a number of positions equal to their size plus 1. In the test case, Object_1 with color 5 and size 20 should have been moved to the right by 21 positions. However, given that the sequence has a fixed dimension of [1, 24], it is not possible to move the object by 21 positions without exceeding the sequence boundary. The correct transformation should maintain the size of Object_1, which should be 20, and shift it to the right within the bounds of the sequence dimension, likely resulting in Object_1 occupying the rightmost positions of the sequence. However, the provided test output shows the size of Object_1 as 4, which is incorrect. Object_2 with color 6 and size 1 is correctly left in place, as per the transformation rules.",
