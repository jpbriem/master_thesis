The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 8}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 19}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: if an object is larger than 1 pixel, it gets split into two objects at its boundaries\noverall pattern: For any input object larger than 1 pixel, create two new objects of the same color at the start and end indices of the original object, each of size 1\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify object(s) in the input sequence that are larger than 1 pixel in size', 'For each identified object, create a new object of the same color at the start index of the original object with a size of 1', 'Create another new object of the same color at the end index of the original object with a size of 1', 'Remove the original object from the sequence', 'Place the new objects at their respective positions, maintaining the overall dimension of the sequence']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
