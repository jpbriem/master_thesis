You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: the largest object changes to color 9, objects with size 2 change to color 9, while all other objects change to color 6
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, for each object, if it is the largest object, change its color to 9, if its size is 2, also change its color to 9, otherwise change its color to 6


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to enumerate all objects and their properties.', 'For each object, compare its size to all other objects to determine the largest one.', 'For each object, if it is the largest object, change its color to 9.', 'If an object has size 2, regardless of whether it is the largest or not, change its color to 9.', 'For all objects that are not the largest and do not have size 2, change their color to 6.', 'Maintain the position of all objects in the sequence.', 'Output the transformed sequence with updated colors as per the above conditions.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 16]
transformed objects: [{'color': 9, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}]

Object_1 is the largest object with a size of 6, and its color correctly changes to 9. Object_2 has a size of 3 and is not the largest, so its color correctly changes to 6. The positions of the objects have been maintained, and the colors have been updated according to the rules. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.",

According to the transformation pattern, the largest object should have its color changed to 9, while any object of size 2 should have its color changed to 9, and all other objects should have their color changed to 6. The test output shows the first object's color correctly changed to 9, as it is the largest object. The second object's color is correctly changed to 6, as it is neither the largest object nor of size 2.
