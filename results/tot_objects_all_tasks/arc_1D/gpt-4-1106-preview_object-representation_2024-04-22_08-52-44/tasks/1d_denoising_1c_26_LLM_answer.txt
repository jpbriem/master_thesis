You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 11}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 10}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects smaller than the largest object of the same color are removed. This is consistent across all examples regardless of the color of the objects.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color, find the largest object by size, remove all other objects of the same color, keep the position and color of the largest object unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Iterate over all objects in the input sequence.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each group, identify the object with the largest size.', 'Remove all other objects of the same color, leaving only the largest object.', 'Keep the position and color of the largest object unchanged in the output sequence.', 'Return the transformed sequence with only the largest objects of each color.']

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects smaller than the largest object of the same color are removed. This is consistent across all examples regardless of the color of the objects.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color, find the largest object by size, remove all other objects of the same color, keep the position and color of the largest object unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Iterate over all objects in the input sequence.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each group, identify the object with the largest size.', 'Remove all other objects of the same color, leaving only the largest object.', 'Keep the position and color of the largest object unchanged in the output sequence.', 'Return the transformed sequence with only the largest objects of each color.']
