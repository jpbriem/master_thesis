The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

The transformation steps have been followed correctly.\", \"value\": 10}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 11}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: All objects, irrespective of their color, size, or initial position, shift to the right by one index position.\noverall pattern: The rule to transform any input into its output is to move every object in the input sequence one position to the right without altering its color or size.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object identified, increment the start_index and end_index by 1.', 'Ensure that the color of the object is preserved during the shift.', 'Ensure that the size of the object remains the same after the shift.', 'Fill the vacated position left by the shifting object with the background color (0).', 'If the shift causes an object to exceed the bounds of the sequence, truncate the object appropriately to fit within the sequence.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers\ntransformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test case output dimension and transformed objects information are missing, which are essential to evaluate if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Without these details, the transformation steps cannot be analyzed for this particular test case.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The provided test case output information is incomplete.
