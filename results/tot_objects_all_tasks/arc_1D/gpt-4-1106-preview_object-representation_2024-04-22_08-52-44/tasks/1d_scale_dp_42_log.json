Following the transformation steps, Object_1's end index should be modified to one less than the start index of Object_2, which is 14. The size should then be adjusted to reflect the new end index, which would be 14 - 2 + 1 = 13. Object_2 remains unchanged as it is the last object in the sequence. The test case output correctly shows Object_1 with an end index of 14 and a size of 13, and Object_2 unchanged with a size of 1.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
