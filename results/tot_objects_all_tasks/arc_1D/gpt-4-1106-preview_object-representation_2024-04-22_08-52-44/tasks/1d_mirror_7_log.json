The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change?

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

According to the pattern, the colors of the two objects should be swapped, and the start index of the first object should be moved to the original start index of the second object. The start index of the second object should then be positioned immediately after the new end index of the first object. In the given test output, the color swap is correct. However, the start index of the first object (now color 9) should be 6, and the end index should be 6 + 2 = 8, which is correct. But the second object (now color 1) should then start at index 9, which is correct, but the end index should be 9, since its size is 1. Therefore, the end index of 9 for the second object is also correct. However, the instructions also specify that all other pixels between and around the objects should remain background color (0), which cannot be determined from the provided information.

According to the transformation steps, the colors of the objects should be swapped, and their positions should be adjusted. For the given input objects, Object_1 should take the color of Object_2 which is 9, and Object_2 should take the color of Object_1 which is 1. The start index of Object_1 should move to the original start index of Object_2 which is 6, and the start index of Object_2 should move to the position immediately after the new end index of Object_1. Given that Object_1 has a size of 3, its new end index would be 6 + 3 - 1 = 8. Therefore, Object_2 should start at index 9. This part of the transformation is done correctly. However, the end index of Object_1 in the output is also 8, which is correct, but the end index of Object_2 is shown as 9, which is incorrect because its size is 1 and therefore, the end index should be the same as the start index, which is 9.
