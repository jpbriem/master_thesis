You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects:

- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 change in size to 3, while objects initially larger than size 1 remain unchanged, regardless of their color or position.
overall pattern: For any given input, if an object is of size 1, it changes to size 3 by moving the start index one position to the left and expanding to the right by two positions. Objects larger than size 1 do not change.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}

Example_2:

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 change in size to 3, while objects initially larger than size 1 remain unchanged, regardless of their color or position.
overall pattern: For any given input, if an object is of size 1, it changes to size 3 by moving the start index one position to the left and expanding to the right by two positions. Objects larger than size 1 do not change.


transformation steps: ['Iterate over each object in the input sequence', 'Check the size of the object', 'If the object size is 1:', '  - Move the start index of the object one position to the left', '  - Expand the object to the right by two positions, making its new size 3', 'If the object size is greater than 1:', '  - Do not change the object', 'Return the transformed sequence as the output']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 change in size to 3, while objects initially larger than size 1 remain unchanged, regardless of their color or position.
overall pattern: For any given input, if an object is of size 1, it changes to size 3 by moving the start index one position to the left and expanding to the right by two positions. Objects larger than size 1 do not change.


transformation steps: ['Iterate over each object in the input sequence', 'Check the size of the object', 'If the object size is 1:', '  - Move the start index of the object one position to the left', '  - Expand the object to the right by two positions, making its new size 3', 'If the object size is greater than 1:', '  - Do not change the object', 'Return the transformed sequence as the output']

input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of size 1 grow to size 3 and shift left by 1 unit regardless of color
overall pattern: single-pixel objects increase to three pixels in size and shift one position to the left while maintaining their original color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if its size is equal to 1.', "If an object's size is 1, shift the object's start_index to the left by 1 position.", "After shifting the start_index, increase the object's size to 3 by extending it to the right, keeping the object's color unchanged.", "If an object's size is greater than 1, do not apply any transformation to this object.", 'Repeat steps 2 to 5 for all objects of size 1 in the sequence.', 'Ensure that no new objects overlap after the transformation.', 'Leave the background pixels (color 0) and any other noise pixels unchanged unless they are part of an object being transformed.', 'The output sequence should maintain the same dimension as the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 33]
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input. Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were followed correctly for the test case input. Each of the single-pixel objects (Object_2 and Object_3) were shifted to the left by one unit and then increased in size to three pixels, maintaining their original color. The multi-pixel object (Object_1) was left unchanged, as specified by the transformation steps. The output sequence dimension remains the same as the input sequence, and there is no object overlap after the transformation. All conditions and steps of the transformation have been met.",

}
------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input. The output shows that Object_1, which was already of size 3, was left unchanged as per the transformation rules. Objects 2 and 3, which were of size 1, were correctly shifted one position to the left and increased in size to 3. The background pixels and dimension remain the same, and no new overlaps between objects were introduced, which is in accordance with the last steps of the transformation rules.",
