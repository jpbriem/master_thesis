You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: The change seems to be consistent across all examples regardless of object color, size, or initial position.
overall pattern: For any input, move each object exactly 3 places to the right while keeping the object's color and size unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the start and end index of each object in the input sequence.', 'For each object, calculate a new start index by adding 3 to the original start index.', 'For each object, calculate a new end index by adding 3 to the original end index.', 'Move each object to the right by updating their start and end index with the new calculated values, ensuring that the color and size remain the same.', 'Replace the original position of the object with background color (0) up to the new start index.', 'Ensure that the dimension of the output sequence remains the same as that of the input sequence.']

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change in position, specifically by moving 3 places to the right, regardless of their initial position, color, or size
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object 3 positions to the right while keeping the color and size of the object unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify the start_index of each object in the input sequence.', 'Add 3 to the start_index of each object to calculate the new start_index in the output sequence.', 'Keep the size of the object the same to calculate the new end_index by adding the same size to the new start_index minus one.', 'Place the object in the output sequence starting at the new start_index and ending at the new end_index, maintaining the same color value.', 'Fill all positions not occupied by an object with the background color, which is 0.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 16}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 21]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 16}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation follows the pattern indicated by the examples and the overall pattern. By moving the object 3 positions to the right, the new start_index for Object_1 in the test case should indeed be 1 + 3 = 4. Since the size of the object remains unchanged at 16, the new end_index should be 4 + 16 - 1 = 19. The color remains the same, which is 7. The background is filled with 0. The output matches the transformation steps and adheres to the pattern given by the examples. Thus, the transformation was applied correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input object has a 'start_index' of 1 and an 'end_index' of 16, making its size 16 units. According to the transformation steps and overall pattern, this object should be moved 3 positions to the right. The new 'start_index' should be 1 + 3 = 4. The 'end_index' should be calculated based on the new 'start_index' and the size of the object. Since the size remains unchanged, the new 'end_index' should be 4 + 16 - 1 = 19. The test output correctly shows the object starting at index 4 and ending at index 19, maintaining its color as 7 and its size as 16. All other positions should be filled with the background color 0. The test output follows the transformation steps accurately.",
