You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: There is a recurring pattern where the smaller object (size 1) with color 9 maintains its position and color, while the larger object changes color to that of the smaller one and moves to a new position that is a certain number of indices away from the smaller object's position. The distance it moves seems to be related to the original size of the larger object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, keep the position and color of the object of size 1 (if its color is 9) unchanged. The larger object should change its color to that of the smaller one and move to a new position that starts a number of indices after the smaller object's position.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [1, 28], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 8}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 28], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap colors and positions. The single-pixel object retains its size but moves to the position immediately after the multi-pixel object's new position. The multi-pixel object keeps its size but moves such that it starts three indices after the single-pixel object's new position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the multi-pixel and single-pixel objects. Swap their colors and reposition them such that the single-pixel object retains its size and is placed immediately after the multi-pixel object's new position, which starts three indices after the single-pixel object.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

output: Dimension: [1, 28], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 8}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [1, 28], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 7}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 28], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap colors and positions. The single-pixel object retains its size but moves to the position immediately after the multi-pixel object's new position. The multi-pixel object keeps its size but moves such that it starts three indices after the single-pixel object's new position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the multi-pixel and single-pixel objects. Swap their colors and reposition them such that the single-pixel object retains its size and is placed immediately after the multi-pixel object's new position, which starts three indices after the single-pixel object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the multi-pixel object and the single-pixel object based on their sizes.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects.', 'Move the single-pixel object to its new position, which is directly after the original position of the multi-pixel object.', 'Move the multi-pixel object to its new position, which is three indices after the new position of the single-pixel object.', 'Ensure that all other pixels in the sequence remain as background color (value 0).', "Adjust the 'start_index' and 'end_index' for both objects to reflect their new positions in the sequence."]

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap colors and positions. The single-pixel object retains its size but moves to the position immediately after the multi-pixel object's new position. The multi-pixel object keeps its size but moves such that it starts three indices after the single-pixel object's new position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the multi-pixel and single-pixel objects. Swap their colors and reposition them such that the single-pixel object retains its size and is placed immediately after the multi-pixel object's new position, which starts three indices after the single-pixel object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the multi-pixel object and the single-pixel object based on their sizes.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects.', 'Move the single-pixel object to its new position, which is directly after the original position of the multi-pixel object.', 'Move the multi-pixel object to its new position, which is three indices after the new position of the single-pixel object.', 'Ensure that all other pixels in the sequence remain as background color (value 0).', "Adjust the 'start_index' and 'end_index' for both objects to reflect their new positions in the sequence."]
