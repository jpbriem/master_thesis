You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 40, 'end_index': 40, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 47, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 8}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 40, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 8}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 48, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 10}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 10}

overall pattern:
conditions: two objects of the same color are merged if they are separated by a uniform gap that is equal to the number of zeros between them
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a consistent number of background pixels between them; merge these pairs into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second, and the size is calculated as the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels between them



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each pair of objects with the same color, check the number of background pixels (zeros) between them.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of same-colored objects is equal to the count of those background pixels, merge the objects.', 'To merge a pair of objects, create a new object with the following properties:', "  - 'color' is the same as the original objects.", "  - 'start_index' is the 'start_index' of the first object in the pair.", "  - 'end_index' is the 'end_index' of the second object in the pair.", "  - 'size' is equal to the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the number of background pixels between them.", 'Remove the original pair of objects from the sequence and replace them with the new merged object.', 'Repeat the process for all pairs of objects that meet the merging condition.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the newly merged objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge if they are paired and there is a consistent gap of pixels between them, which may vary but is consistent within each input sequence
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a consistent gap between them within the input sequence, merge each pair into a single object with the same color, where the new size spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object of the pair

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: two objects of the same color are merged if they are separated by a uniform gap that is equal to the number of zeros between them
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a consistent number of background pixels between them; merge these pairs into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second, and the size is calculated as the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each pair of objects with the same color, check the number of background pixels (zeros) between them.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of same-colored objects is equal to the count of those background pixels, merge the objects.', 'To merge a pair of objects, create a new object with the following properties:', "  - 'color' is the same as the original objects.", "  - 'start_index' is the 'start_index' of the first object in the pair.", "  - 'end_index' is the 'end_index' of the second object in the pair.", "  - 'size' is equal to the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the number of background pixels between them.", 'Remove the original pair of objects from the sequence and replace them with the new merged object.', 'Repeat the process for all pairs of objects that meet the merging condition.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the newly merged objects.']

The gap between Object_1 and Object_2 is 5, between Object_2 and Object_3 is 11, between Object_3 and Object_4 is 5, between Object_4 and Object_5 is 11, and between Object_5 and Object_6 is 5.

The same gap size applies between Object_2 and Object_3 (indices 8-18), Object_3 and Object_4 (indices 20-24), and Object_4 and Object_5 (indices 26-36). Therefore, they should also not be merged. The gap between Object_5 and Object_6 is 5 zeros (indices 38-42), which again is not equal to the size of the objects. Consequently, no objects should be merged, and the output should be identical to the input with respect to the positions and sizes of the objects. Since no specific output was provided to analyze, this analysis cannot be rated.", "value": 0}

  "test_output_analysis": "To determine if the test output is correct, we must apply the transformation steps to the given test input and compare the result with the test output. Each pair of objects of the same color should be merged if they are separated by a number of zeros equal to the size of one of the objects. The test input has six objects of color 2, with consistent gaps of 5 zeros between Object_1 and Object_2, Object_3 and Object_4, and Object_5 and Object_6. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, these pairs should be merged into three objects. The merged objects should have sizes of 7 each, calculated by adding the size of the two objects (1+1) and the 5 zeros between them. The start_index and end_index of the merged objects should be the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the second object in each pair. Without the actual test output provided, it is impossible to compare and rate the transformation. Therefore, without the test output, the given value should be 0.",
