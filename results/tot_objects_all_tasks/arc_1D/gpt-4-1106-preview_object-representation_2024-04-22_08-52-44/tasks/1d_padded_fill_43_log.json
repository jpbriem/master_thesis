The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation steps were followed correctly. The input objects are all of the same color, and there are consistent numbers of background pixels between the objects that qualify them to be merged. In the test case, the distances between the objects' end and start indices are 3, 6, 3, 6, and 3 respectively. From the examples, we can infer that objects with a consistent number of background pixels between them are to be merged. Since Object_1 and Object_2 have 3 background pixels between them, they are merged into a single object with a size of 5. The same applies to Object_3 and Object_4, and to Object_5 and Object_6, where they are separated by 3 background pixels and subsequently merged. The size of each merged object is calculated as the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the intervening background pixels, which is correct. The start and end indices of the merged objects are also correct according to the transformation rules.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output appears to follow the overall pattern and the transformation steps correctly. Given the input sequence, it is clear that the transformation pattern is to merge objects of the same color that have 3 background pixels between them into a single object. This pattern is consistent with the examples provided. In the test input, there are 3 background pixels between Object_1 and Object_2, 6 background pixels between Object_2 and Object_3, 3 background pixels between Object_3 and Object_4, 6 background pixels between Object_4 and Object_5, and 3 background pixels between Object_5 and Object_6. According to the pattern, Object_1 and Object_2 should merge, as well as Object_3 and Object_4, and Object_5 and Object_6, since they have 3 background pixels between them. The output correctly reflects these merges, with each merged object having a size that is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the intervening background pixels. The start and end indexes are also correctly transformed, making the size of each new object equal to 5. Therefore, the output is consistent with the transformation rules and the overall pattern observed in the examples.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
