The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

According to the overall pattern, each object should shift to the right by 3 units. In the provided test case, Object_1 should have a new start_index of 3 and a new end_index of 10, which is correctly applied. However, the size of the object should remain the same. Since the original object had a size of 8, the object in the output should span from index 3 to index 10, which also results in a size of 8, confirming that the size is unchanged. The color is maintained as 2, which is correct. The space between the new start and end indices (3 to 10) is correctly filled with the color 2. The previous position of the object (indices 0 to 7) should be replaced with background color 0 up to the new start_index 3, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as correct if indices 0 to 2 are filled with 0.

The end_index has also been correctly moved from 7 to 10, maintaining the size of the object at 8 units. The color of the object has been maintained as 2. However, there is a critical error in the transformation. The transformation steps specify that the new start_index should be the current start_index plus 3. As the start_index of Object_1 was 0, the new start_index after adding 3 should be 3, which is correctly reflected in the test output. However, the transformation did not account for the fact that the object cannot be shifted right without changing the sequence's length. Since the input sequence starts with the object at index 0, shifting it right by 3 would result in the object's new end_index being 11, not 10.
