You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color based on their size. The size of the object determines the new color according to a set mapping.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the size of each object and then apply the following transformations: objects with size 1 change to color 9, size 2 to color 1, and size 3 to color 6. This rule is consistently applied across all examples, regardless of the original color or position of the objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color based on their size. The size of the object determines the new color according to a set mapping.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the size of each object and then apply the following transformations: objects with size 1 change to color 9, size 2 to color 1, and size 3 to color 6. This rule is consistently applied across all examples, regardless of the original color or position of the objects.



transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence by locating groups of non-zero, matching pixel values', 'Determine the size of each identified object', 'Apply the color transformation to each object based on its size:', '  - Objects with size 1 change their color to 9', '  - Objects with size 2 change their color to 1', '  - Objects with size 3 change their color to 6', 'Leave the position and size of the objects unchanged', 'Replace the colors of the objects in the input sequence with their new colors according to the rules outlined']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Example_2:

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is consistent across all examples: objects change color based on their size, regardless of their original color or position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, change the color of each object based on its size: objects of size 1 change to color 9, objects of size 2 change to color 1, and objects of size 3 change to color 6.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'For objects with a size of 1, change their color to 9.', 'For objects with a size of 2, change their color to 1.', 'For objects with a size of 3, change their color to 6.', 'Leave objects with a size other than 1, 2, or 3 unchanged (if any exist).', 'Output the transformed sequence with the new colors while preserving the positions and sizes of the original objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color based on their size. The size of the object determines the new color according to a set mapping.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the size of each object and then apply the following transformations: objects with size 1 change to color 9, size 2 to color 1, and size 3 to color 6. This rule is consistently applied across all examples, regardless of the original color or position of the objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence by locating groups of non-zero, matching pixel values', 'Determine the size of each identified object', 'Apply the color transformation to each object based on its size:', '  - Objects with size 1 change their color to 9', '  - Objects with size 2 change their color to 1', '  - Objects with size 3 change their color to 6', 'Leave the position and size of the objects unchanged', 'Replace the colors of the objects in the input sequence with their new colors according to the rules outlined']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation is consistent across all examples: objects change color based on their size, regardless of their original color or position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, change the color of each object based on its size: objects of size 1 change to color 9, objects of size 2 change to color 1, and objects of size 3 change to color 6.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'For objects with a size of 1, change their color to 9.', 'For objects with a size of 2, change their color to 1.', 'For objects with a size of 3, change their color to 6.', 'Leave objects with a size other than 1, 2, or 3 unchanged (if any exist).', 'Output the transformed sequence with the new colors while preserving the positions and sizes of the original objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
