You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they contain colors other than the object's predominant color. Non-predominant colors within an object are transformed into the predominant color.
overall pattern: The type of object that changes is any object that contains more than one color. The reason it changes is that the object should be of a uniform color, which is the predominant color present in the object initially. The way it changes is by transforming all pixels within the object to the predominant color.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation rule across all examples seems to involve homogenizing the color of pixels within an object to match the majority color. The majority color is the one that appears most frequently within the object. The position and size of objects remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the majority color within each object and change all other colors within that object to the majority color. Preserve the size and position of each object.



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify distinct objects based on sequences of non-zero pixels separated by zeros.', 'For each identified object, create a count of each color within the object.', 'Determine the majority color for each object by identifying the color with the highest count within that object.', 'Replace all pixels within an object that do not match the majority color with the majority color.', 'Output the transformed sequence with objects now homogenized to their respective majority colors, maintaining their original positions and sizes.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation rule across all examples seems to involve homogenizing the color of pixels within an object to match the majority color. The majority color is the one that appears most frequently within the object. The position and size of objects remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the majority color within each object and change all other colors within that object to the majority color. Preserve the size and position of each object.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify distinct objects based on sequences of non-zero pixels separated by zeros.', 'For each identified object, create a count of each color within the object.', 'Determine the majority color for each object by identifying the color with the highest count within that object.', 'Replace all pixels within an object that do not match the majority color with the majority color.', 'Output the transformed sequence with objects now homogenized to their respective majority colors, maintaining their original positions and sizes.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they contain colors other than the object's predominant color. Non-predominant colors within an object are transformed into the predominant color.
overall pattern: The type of object that changes is any object that contains more than one color. The reason it changes is that the object should be of a uniform color, which is the predominant color present in the object initially. The way it changes is by transforming all pixels within the object to the predominant color.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the sequence by locating contiguous non-zero pixels.', 'For each identified object, determine the predominant color, which is the color that appears most frequently within that object.', 'Transform the color of all pixels within the object to match the predominant color of the object.', 'Ensure that the size and position of the object remain unchanged after transformation.', 'Repeat the process for each object in the sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation rule across all examples seems to involve homogenizing the color of pixels within an object to match the majority color. The majority color is the one that appears most frequently within the object. The position and size of objects remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the majority color within each object and change all other colors within that object to the majority color. Preserve the size and position of each object.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify distinct objects based on sequences of non-zero pixels separated by zeros.', 'For each identified object, create a count of each color within the object.', 'Determine the majority color for each object by identifying the color with the highest count within that object.', 'Replace all pixels within an object that do not match the majority color with the majority color.', 'Output the transformed sequence with objects now homogenized to their respective majority colors, maintaining their original positions and sizes.']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they contain colors other than the object's predominant color. Non-predominant colors within an object are transformed into the predominant color.
overall pattern: The type of object that changes is any object that contains more than one color. The reason it changes is that the object should be of a uniform color, which is the predominant color present in the object initially. The way it changes is by transforming all pixels within the object to the predominant color.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the sequence by locating contiguous non-zero pixels.', 'For each identified object, determine the predominant color, which is the color that appears most frequently within that object.', 'Transform the color of all pixels within the object to match the predominant color of the object.', 'Ensure that the size and position of the object remain unchanged after transformation.', 'Repeat the process for each object in the sequence.']

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation pattern correctly. The input sequence had an object with mixed colors, and after transformation, the object has been changed to have a uniform color, which is the predominant color '7'. The size and position of the object remain unchanged, which is consistent with the transformation steps. No deviations from the transformation pattern or steps are evident.", "value": 10}
------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output adheres to the transformation pattern established by the examples and the detailed transformation steps. The input object contained multiple colors: 7, 8, 5, 2, and 9, with the color 7 being the predominant one. The transformation steps were applied correctly: The object was identified, the predominant color 7 was determined, all non-predominant colors within the object were changed to 7, and the size and position of the object remained the same. The final output object is uniformly colored with the color 7 and matches the input object size and coordinates.",
