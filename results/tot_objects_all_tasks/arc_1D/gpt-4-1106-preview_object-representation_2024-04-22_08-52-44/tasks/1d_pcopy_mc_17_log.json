For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: if an object is a single pixel in size, it increases to size 3 and shifts one position to the left\noverall pattern: Any single pixel object changes by increasing its size to 3 and moving one position to the left, while objects larger than one pixel remain unchanged\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Iterate through the list of objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the size is equal to 1.', 'If the object size is 1, create a new object with the same color, a start_index that is one less than the original start_index, and a size of 3.', 'If the object is larger than 1 pixel, copy it to the output sequence without any changes.', 'Maintain the original sequence dimension for the output.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
