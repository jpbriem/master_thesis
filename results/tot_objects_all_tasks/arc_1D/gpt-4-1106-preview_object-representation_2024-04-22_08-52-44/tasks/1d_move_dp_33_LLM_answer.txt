You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The given test output does not appear to be correct according to the transformation rules provided. The original starting index of Object_1 is 0, and since the size of Object_1 is greater than 1, it should have been moved to the right by 0 positions, which is its starting index value. However, since the starting index is not greater than 5, no additional shift modification (such as subtracting 2) should be applied. Therefore, Object_1 should have remained in the original position, which it does according to the provided output. However, it's important to note that the shift value suggests no movement would occur regardless, so this object is not a definitive test of the transformation rules. Object_2 has a size of 1, which means it should not move, and according to the output, it has not been moved. The output shows both objects unchanged, which is partially consistent with the transformation steps. However, without a test case that includes an object with a starting index greater than 5, we cannot fully validate the exception rule. Given the information and the test case provided, the transformation seems to be applied correctly, but the test case is not comprehensive enough to fully test the transformation pattern.",

According to the transformation pattern, objects larger than size 1 should shift to the right by a number of indices equal to their original starting index, and if the starting index is greater than 5, the shift should be reduced by 2. Object_1 has a size greater than 1 and an original starting index of 0, so it should have been shifted to the right by 0 positions — which correctly matches the output. However, since the starting index is 0, it means there's no need for any adjustment (such as subtracting 2), and therefore it seems the output is indeed correct for Object_1. Object_2 has a size of 1, so it correctly remains unchanged in the output. Given these considerations, the transformation appears to have been applied correctly.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.
