You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 2, 2, 2, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [7, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects as a whole, independent of their size
overall pattern: For any object, move the first pixel color to the end of the object



transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence based on the continuity of pixel colors.', 'For each object, take note of the color of the first pixel.', 'Move the first pixel color to the end of the object while maintaining the order of the other pixels within the object.', 'Keep the position of the object within the sequence unchanged.', 'Ensure that the background color (0) remains unaffected and in its original position throughout the transformation.']

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Value Prompt:

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 2, 2, 2, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 2, 2, 2, 8], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [7, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [5, 5, 5, 5, 7], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9]], 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8], 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9]], 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects as a whole, independent of their size
overall pattern: For any object, move the first pixel color to the end of the object


transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence based on the continuity of pixel colors.', 'For each object, take note of the color of the first pixel.', 'Move the first pixel color to the end of the object while maintaining the order of the other pixels within the object.', 'Keep the position of the object within the sequence unchanged.', 'Ensure that the background color (0) remains unaffected and in its original position throughout the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 13],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': [7, 6, 6, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 4}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 13]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 6, 6, 7], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]], 'size': 4}

The size of the object remains unchanged, the coordinates are consistent, and the rest of the sequence remains unaffected, indicating that the transformation was applied correctly and the background color remained unchanged.", "value": 10}
