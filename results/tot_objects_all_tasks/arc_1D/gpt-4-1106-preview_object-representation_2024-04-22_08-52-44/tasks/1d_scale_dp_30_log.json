The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change?

The correct 'end_index' for the first object after transformation should therefore have been either 9 (leaving two positions before the second object) or 10 (leaving one position before the second object). However, the test output incorrectly indicates that the first object has an 'end_index' of 10, which is only one position before the second object, rather than considering the possibility of stopping two positions before. The size of the first object is also incorrectly given as 11 when it should be 10 if stopping one position before or 9 if stopping two positions before. Since the possibility of stopping two positions before was not considered, the transformation does not fully adhere to the given overall pattern.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The pattern dictates that the first object should expand to the right up to either one or two positions before the start of the second object. In the test case, the first object starts at index 0 and ends at index 8, and the second object is at index 11. After applying the transformation, the first object should end either at index 9 or 10, as both would satisfy the condition of being one or two positions before the second object. The test output shows the first object expanded to index 10, which is correct. The second object remains unchanged, which also follows the pattern. The test output correctly transformed the input sequence based on the provided transformation steps and overall pattern.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
