You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes solely affect the first object in the sequence, increasing its size by a constant amount, regardless of its initial size, color, or position. The second object, which is the same across all examples (color 4, size 1, and in a fixed position), does not change.
overall pattern: For any given input sequence, increase the size of the first object by 2 (for Example_1) or 3 (for Examples_2 and 3), while keeping all other attributes the same. All subsequent objects remain unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are larger than size 1 but not exceeding a certain upper limit seem to increase in size by 3 units. Objects of size 1 do not change.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, check each object's size. If an object's size is greater than 1, increase its size by 3 units, extending its end_index accordingly. The color and start_index of objects remain unchanged. Objects of size 1 do not change.


transformation steps: ['Iterate through each object in the input sequence.', "If an object's size is greater than 1, increase its size by 2 units.", "Adjust the 'end_index' of the object by adding 2 to the current 'end_index'.", "Keep the 'color' and 'start_index' of the object unchanged.", "If an object's size is 1, do not perform any transformations on it."]

input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are larger than size 1 but not exceeding a certain upper limit seem to increase in size by 3 units. Objects of size 1 do not change.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, check each object's size. If an object's size is greater than 1, increase its size by 3 units, extending its end_index accordingly. The color and start_index of objects remain unchanged. Objects of size 1 do not change.


transformation steps: ['Iterate through each object in the input sequence.', "If an object's size is greater than 1, increase its size by 2 units.", "Adjust the 'end_index' of the object by adding 2 to the current 'end_index'.", "Keep the 'color' and 'start_index' of the object unchanged.", "If an object's size is 1, do not perform any transformations on it."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 23}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 29]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 25}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps are not consistent with the overall pattern. The overall pattern specifies that the size of objects larger than 1 should be increased by 3 units, but the transformation steps state to increase the size by 2 units. In the test case, the size of Object_1 has been increased by 2 units, from 23 to 25, which follows the transformation steps but contradicts the overall pattern that indicates an increase by 3 units. The output is consistent with the transformation steps provided but not with the overall pattern. Therefore, the test output is not entirely correct as it does not adhere to the overall pattern observed in the examples.", "value": 4}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output suggests that the transformation was applied, but there is a discrepancy between the described overall pattern and the detailed transformation steps. According to the overall pattern, objects of size greater than 1 should have their size increased by 3 units. However, the transformation steps indicate an increase of 2 units to the size of objects greater than 1. The test output reflects the transformation steps and not the overall pattern, as the size of Object_1 increased from 23 to 25 instead of the expected 26 based on the overall pattern. Therefore, the transformation steps were followed, but they are not consistent with the overall pattern described, creating an incorrect output when considering the intended pattern.", "value": 4}
