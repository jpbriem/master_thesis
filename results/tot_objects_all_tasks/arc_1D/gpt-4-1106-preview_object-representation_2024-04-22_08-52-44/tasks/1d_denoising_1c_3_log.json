For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 14}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects are removed if their size is 1\noverall pattern: remove all objects of size 1, regardless of their color or position, and leave objects with size greater than 1 unchanged\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Iterate over each object in the input sequence.', 'Check the size of each object.', 'If the object size is greater than 1, keep the object unchanged.', 'If the object size equals 1, remove this object from the sequence.', 'The output sequence should now contain only objects with size greater than 1, preserving their original color and position.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
