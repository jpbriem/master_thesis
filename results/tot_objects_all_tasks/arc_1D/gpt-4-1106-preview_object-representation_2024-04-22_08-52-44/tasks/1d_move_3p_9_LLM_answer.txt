You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.

The background between indices 0 to 7 should be filled with 0, and indices 22 to 24 should remain as background color 0. Since the color, size, and indices after the transformation are correct, it appears that the test output has been correctly transformed according to the given steps.",

Value Prompt:

system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 10}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 14}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 7}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects change position by moving 3 spaces to the right. There are no conditions related to the color or size of the objects.
overall pattern: For any input, the transformation involves moving any existing object exactly 3 spaces to the right, without altering the color or size of the object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the start and end indices of each object in the input sequence.', 'Calculate the new start index for each object by adding 3 to the original start index.', 'Calculate the new end index for each object by adding 3 to the original end index.', 'Ensure that the new indices do not exceed the bounds of the sequence dimension. If they do, wrap around or truncate as per the defined behavior (not specified here).', "Fill the range between the new start index and new end index with the object's color.", 'Fill the range between the original start index and the new start index with background color (0).', 'Repeat the steps for each object in the sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 14}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 14}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were followed correctly. The object in the input sequence starts at index 5 and ends at index 18 with the color 2. Following the transformation steps, the start index is moved 3 spaces to the right, resulting in a new start index of 8. Similarly, the end index is moved 3 spaces to the right, resulting in a new end index of 21. The size of the object remains the same at 14, indicating that no pixels were added or lost in the transformation. The output sequence respects the original color of the object and adheres to the overall pattern of moving objects 3 spaces to the right without altering their size or color. There is no indication of exceeding the bounds of the sequence, so wrapping or truncation is not an issue in this case.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input indicates an object of color 2 starting at index 5 and ending at index 18, which is a size of 14. The transformation steps indicate that objects should move three spaces to the right. The test output shows the object starting at index 8 and ending at index 21, which correctly maintains the size of 14 and reflects a movement three spaces to the right. No wrapping or truncation was specified or needed, as the new indices are within the bounds of the sequence dimension. The color of the object remains unchanged, as per the transformation pattern. Therefore, the transformation appears to have been applied correctly to the test input.",
