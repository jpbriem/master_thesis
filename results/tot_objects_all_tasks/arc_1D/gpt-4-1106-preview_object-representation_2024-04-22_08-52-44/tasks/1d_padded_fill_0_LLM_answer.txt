You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and are separated by a consistent number of background pixels. The number of background pixels that determine merging seems to vary with the color of the objects or another pattern not discernible from the given examples.
overall pattern: Two objects of the same color merge into a single object if they are separated by a fixed number of background pixels, which may be related to the color of the objects or another unknown rule. The new object extends from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, and its size is the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance between them.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the input sequence.', 'For each pair of objects with the same color, calculate the number of background pixels separating them.', 'Determine the potential combined size of each pair of objects after merging, which is the sum of their individual sizes plus the number of background pixels between them.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of objects is one less than their potential combined size after merging, proceed with merging.', 'To merge a pair of objects, create a new object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object.', 'The color of the merged object remains the same as the original objects.', 'The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of both original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', 'Replace the original pair of objects with the newly merged object in the output sequence.', 'Repeat this process for all pairs of objects with the same color that meet the merging condition.', 'If an object does not have a pair that meets the condition, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.', 'After processing all objects, output the transformed sequence with merged and unchanged objects.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 48], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 35, 'end_index': 35, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 48], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 9}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 35, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 9}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 48], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 36, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 46, 'end_index': 46, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 48], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 46, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 48], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 37, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 48], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge if they are separated by a consistent number of background pixels
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a consistent gap; merge them into a single object where the size is the sum of their indices adjusted by the fixed gap value



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence', 'Calculate the gap between the first and second object of the same color', 'Check if all subsequent objects of the same color are separated by the same gap', 'If the gap is consistent for all pairs, merge each pair of objects into a single object', 'The start index of the merged object is the start index of the first object in the pair', 'The end index of the merged object is the end index of the second object in the pair', 'The size of the merged object is the distance from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object inclusive', 'Remove the individual objects that were merged', 'Repeat this process for all pairs of objects with the same color and consistent gaps throughout the sequence', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge together if they are separated by a number of background pixels that is one less than the combined size of the two objects after merging
overall pattern: find pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a specific number of background pixels, where the number of background pixels is one less than what their combined size would be after merging; merge these objects into a single object that spans the entire distance from the start of the first object to the end of the second object


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the input sequence.', 'For each pair of objects with the same color, calculate the number of background pixels separating them.', 'Determine the potential combined size of each pair of objects after merging, which is the sum of their individual sizes plus the number of background pixels between them.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of objects is one less than their potential combined size after merging, proceed with merging.', 'To merge a pair of objects, create a new object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object.', 'The color of the merged object remains the same as the original objects.', 'The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of both original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', 'Replace the original pair of objects with the newly merged object in the output sequence.', 'Repeat this process for all pairs of objects with the same color that meet the merging condition.', 'If an object does not have a pair that meets the condition, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.', 'After processing all objects, output the transformed sequence with merged and unchanged objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

{
  "test_output_analysis": "To analyze the test output, we should follow the transformation steps and apply them to the test input. According to the overall pattern, we identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a consistent gap and merge them into a single object. The size of the merged object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the fixed gap value. From the test input, we have six objects of color 4. The gaps between the objects are as follows: 14 - 5 = 9, 21 - 14 = 7, 30 - 21 = 9, 37 - 30 = 7, 46 - 37 = 9. The gaps are not consistent, as they alternate between 9 and 7. According to the pattern, objects should only merge if they are separated by a consistent number of background pixels. Since the gap is not consistent, none of the objects should merge. Thus, the output should have the same objects as the input, with no change in their size, start_index, or end_index. Without the specific transformed objects being described in the test output, it is not possible to give a rating for the test output accuracy.",
