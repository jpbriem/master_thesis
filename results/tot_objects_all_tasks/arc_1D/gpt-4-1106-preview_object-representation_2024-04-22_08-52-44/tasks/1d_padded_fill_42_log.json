The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

According to the pattern, the objects should expand to fill the space between them only when they are a consistent number of indices apart. In the test case input, the objects are 5 indices apart, and thus the size of the expanded objects should be 6 to fill the gap of 5 zeros plus one for the object itself. However, the described test output claims that the transformed objects have a size of 5, which indicates that they only cover a gap of 4 zeros instead of 5. Therefore, the transformation was not applied correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation steps were not correctly applied to the test input. According to the overall pattern, objects expand to fill the space between them when they are a consistent number of indices apart. The input objects are separated by consistent gaps of 4 zeros (background pixels) between them: Object_1 is followed by 4 zeros before Object_2, Object_2 is followed by 4 zeros before Object_3, and so on. The transformation rules specify that the objects should expand to fill these gaps, such that each object's size becomes the gap size plus one. Therefore, Object_1 should expand to cover indices 1 to 6 (inclusive), Object_2 should expand to cover indices 6 to 11, Object_3 should expand to cover indices 11 to 16, Object_4 should expand to cover indices 16 to 21, and Object_5 should expand to cover indices 21 to 26. However, this would result in overlapping objects, which is not accounted for in the transformation steps provided. The correct transformation according to the rules should result in each object having a size of 6 and spanning 6 indices. The test output indicates that each object has a size of 5 instead of the expected size of 6, and the objects' start indices are correctly identified but the end indices are off by one. The objects should span from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object in each consecutive pair, leading to a size of 6 for each transformed object.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}"
