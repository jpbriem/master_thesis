The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 13}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects are removed except for the one with the largest size\noverall pattern: Identify the object with the largest size and remove all other objects, leaving the largest object unchanged\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Compare sizes of all identified objects to find the object with the largest size.', 'Remove all objects except for the one with the largest size from the sequence.', 'Leave the largest object unchanged in its original position within the sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input sequence has four objects of color 5, with the sizes of 14, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. According to the transformation steps, we identify all objects and calculate their sizes. Object_1 is the largest object, with a size of 14. The transformation steps then require us to remove all objects except for the one with the largest size, which is Object_1. The output sequence correctly reflects this, containing only Object_1 with a size of 14, maintaining its original color (5), start_index (3), and end_index (16). The remaining objects, which are smaller, have been removed, and the positions and sizes of the retained object are unchanged, as required by the overall pattern.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n###########################################################\nNo Valuation - Duplicate candidate#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
