You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, the determining condition for the change is the size of the objects. Positions of objects do not affect the transformation.
overall pattern: The general rule to transform any input into its output is by changing the color of the objects based on their size: objects of size 3 change to color 3, objects of size 2 change to color 6, and objects of size 1 change to color 9. This pattern applies regardless of the objects' original color or position within the sequence.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the objects change color based on their size, regardless of their initial color or position.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, change the color of each object based on its size: size 3 objects to color 3, size 2 objects to color 6, and size 1 objects to color 9.



transformation steps: ['For each object in the input sequence:', '1. If the size of the object is 3, change its color to 3.', '2. If the size of the object is 2, change its color to 6.', '3. If the size of the object is 1, change its color to 9.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the new colors for each object while maintaining their original positions.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change based on their size, independent of their initial color or position. The size of the object is the sole determinant of the color change in the output.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, to transform it into its output, identify the objects by size. If an object has a size of 3, change its color to 3. If an object has a size of 2, change its color to 6. If an object has a size of 1, change its color to 9. The position and size of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify objects.', 'For each identified object, determine its size by counting the number of adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Apply the following color transformation rules based on the size of the object:', "   - If the object's size is 3, change its color to 3.", "   - If the object's size is 2, change its color to 6.", "   - If the object's size is 1, change its color to 9.", 'Maintain the original position and size of each object in the output sequence.', 'Leave the background color (0) unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change based on their size, independent of their initial color or position. The size of the object is the sole determinant of the color change in the output.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, to transform it into its output, identify the objects by size. If an object has a size of 3, change its color to 3. If an object has a size of 2, change its color to 6. If an object has a size of 1, change its color to 9. The position and size of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify objects.', 'For each identified object, determine its size by counting the number of adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Apply the following color transformation rules based on the size of the object:', "   - If the object's size is 3, change its color to 3.", "   - If the object's size is 2, change its color to 6.", "   - If the object's size is 1, change its color to 9.", 'Maintain the original position and size of each object in the output sequence.', 'Leave the background color (0) unchanged.']

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.
