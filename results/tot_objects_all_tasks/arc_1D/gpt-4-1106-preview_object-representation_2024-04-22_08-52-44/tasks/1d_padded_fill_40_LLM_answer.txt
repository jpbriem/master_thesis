You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color are combined if they are separated by an even number of background pixels, specifically two background pixels in these examples
overall pattern: for objects of the same color that are separated by two background pixels, merge them into one object that starts at the start_index of the first and ends at the end_index of the second, thus increasing their size to encompass the span of both original objects and the background pixels between them



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence that are of the same color.', 'Check the distance between adjacent objects of the same color.', 'If the distance between the end_index of one object and the start_index of the next object of the same color is exactly two pixels, proceed with the combination.', "Replace the sequence of pixels starting from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object with pixels of the object's color, effectively merging the two objects and including the background pixels between them.", 'Remove any original separate object entries from the list of objects, and update the list to include only the newly combined objects.', 'Repeat the combination process for every pair of objects where the condition is met.', 'Ensure that no further combinations can be made, and that all objects not involved in any combination remain unchanged.', 'The output sequence is now the original sequence with the specified objects combined as described.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

input: Dimension: [1, 75], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 42, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 48, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 67, 'end_index': 67, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 73, 'end_index': 73, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 75], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 42, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 52, 'end_index': 52, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 67, 'end_index': 67, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color expand to the next object of the same color if the distance between them is less than or equal to (2 * size of the objects - 1)
overall pattern: for each object, calculate the distance to the next object of the same color. If this distance is less than or equal to (2 * size of the objects - 1), the objects merge into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object in the sequence



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check the color and measure the distance to the next object of the same color.', 'If the distance to the next object of the same color is less than or equal to (2 * size of the object - 1), merge the two objects.', 'To merge two objects: set the start index of the merged object to the start index of the first object and the end index to the end index of the last object, the size becomes the sum of individual sizes plus the distance between them.', 'Continue merging objects of the same color that satisfy the distance condition until no further merging is possible.', 'Repeat the process for all objects of the same color in the sequence.', 'The output sequence should only contain the merged objects according to the above rules.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color are combined if they are separated by an even number of background pixels, specifically two background pixels in these examples
overall pattern: for objects of the same color that are separated by two background pixels, merge them into one object that starts at the start_index of the first and ends at the end_index of the second, thus increasing their size to encompass the span of both original objects and the background pixels between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence that are of the same color.', 'Check the distance between adjacent objects of the same color.', 'If the distance between the end_index of one object and the start_index of the next object of the same color is exactly two pixels, proceed with the combination.', "Replace the sequence of pixels starting from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object with pixels of the object's color, effectively merging the two objects and including the background pixels between them.", 'Remove any original separate object entries from the list of objects, and update the list to include only the newly combined objects.', 'Repeat the combination process for every pair of objects where the condition is met.', 'Ensure that no further combinations can be made, and that all objects not involved in any combination remain unchanged.', 'The output sequence is now the original sequence with the specified objects combined as described.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.
