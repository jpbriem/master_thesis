The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 17}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: All objects shift to the right by one position regardless of their color, size, or initial position.\noverall pattern: For any input sequence, each object is transformed by shifting its position one index to the right. The type of object that changes is any object, the reason it changes is the transformation rule, and the way it changes is a shift to the right by one position.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', \"For each object, increase the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 1 to shift the object to the right by one position.\", 'Ensure that the dimension of the output sequence remains the same as the input sequence.', 'Fill in the background color (0) in the positions that become unoccupied after the shift.', 'If an object is at the end of the sequence and shifting it would exceed the dimension limit, truncate the object to fit within the sequence bounds.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
