The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The test case input sequence has the following objects: Object_1 with size 3, Object_2 with size 2, Object_3 with size 1, Object_4 with size 1, and Object_5 with size 2. According to the overall pattern, objects of size 1 should change to color 3, size 2 to color 1, and size 3 to color 4. The expected test output should be a sequence with Object_1 of color 4, Object_2 of color 1, Object_3 of color 3, Object_4 of color 3, and Object_5 of color 1. The provided test output should match this expected sequence. If it does, the test output is correct, and the transformation was applied correctly.
