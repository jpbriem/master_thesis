For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 5}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 4}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The change of color for each object is determined by the object's position in the sequence. Specifically, the first object changes color to 1, and the following objects alternate colors between 6 and 1, starting with 6 for the second object.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the following rules apply: The first object in the sequence changes color to 1. Subsequent objects alternate between colors 6 and 1, starting with 6 for the second object. All objects retain their original position and size.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all the objects in the input sequence.', 'Change the color of the first object to 1.', 'For each subsequent object, determine its position in the sequence (second, third, etc.).', 'If the object is in an even position (second, fourth, etc.), change its color to 6.', 'If the object is in an odd position (third, fifth, etc.), change its color to 1.', 'Retain the original position and size of each object throughout the transformation.', 'Apply these steps sequentially from the first object to the last object in the sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

Specifically, the first object changes color to 1, and the following objects alternate colors between 6 and 1, starting with 6 for the second object.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the following rules apply: The first object in the sequence changes color to 1. Subsequent objects alternate between colors 6 and 1, starting with 6 for the second object. All objects retain their original position and size.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all the objects in the input sequence.', 'Change the color of the first object to 1.', 'For each subsequent object, determine its position in the sequence (second, third, etc.).', 'If the object is in an even position (second, fourth, etc.), change its color to 6.', 'If the object is in an odd position (third, fifth, etc.), change its color to 1.', 'Retain the original position and size of each object throughout the transformation.', 'Apply these steps sequentially from the first object to the last object in the sequence.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 3}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 25]\ntransformed objects: [{'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}, {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, {'color': 6, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 3}]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output follows the overall pattern as described. The first object changes its color to 1, which is correct. The second object's color changes to 6, the third to 1, and the fourth to 6. This correctly follows the alternating color pattern between 6 and 1 for even and odd positions respectively, after the first object. The positions and sizes of the objects in the output match those in the input, in accordance with the transformation steps. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation appears to be applied correctly. The test input has four objects, and the transformation rules are followed: the first object's color is changed to 1, the second to 6, the third to 1, and the fourth to 6, in accordance with the alternating color change pattern. Each object retains its original position and size, as required.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
