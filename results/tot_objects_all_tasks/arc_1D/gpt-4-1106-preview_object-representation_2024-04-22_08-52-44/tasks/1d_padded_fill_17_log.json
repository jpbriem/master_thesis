The test output also accurately combines adjacent objects based on the uniform distance identified in the input, which is consistent with the observed pattern from the examples. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of the size of the combined objects. The size should be calculated as 'end_index - start_index + 1', but instead, it seems the size of an individual object was added to the 'end_index - start_index', which is incorrect. For example, for Object_1, the size should be 11 - 0 + 1 = 12, which is correct. But for the other objects, the same logic should result in sizes of 27 - 16 + 1 = 12 and 43 - 32 + 1 = 12, not 12 as stated. This suggests an error in the transformation process.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output seems to have been transformed correctly according to the provided transformation pattern and steps. The input objects are all of color 6 and are uniformly separated by a distance of 11 indices between their starting points (Object_2 starts at index 11, which is 11 indices away from Object_1 starting at index 0; Object_3 starts at index 16, which is 5 indices away from Object_2 starting at index 11, which does not follow the pattern; however, Object_4 starts at index 27, which is 11 indices away from Object_3 starting at index 16; and so on). The output objects have been merged accordingly, with the new objects spanning from the start_index of the first object to the start_index of the second object in each identified pair, and the sizes have been calculated correctly as the distance plus the size of an individual object. The size of each new object is 12, accounting for the 11 indices between the starting indices plus the original size of 1. All these transformations adhere to the pattern observed in the examples.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
