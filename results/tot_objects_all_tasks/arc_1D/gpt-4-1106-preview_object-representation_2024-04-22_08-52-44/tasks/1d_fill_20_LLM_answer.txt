You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 9}

input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change only when there are two objects of the same color; these objects are merged into one, extending from the start of the first object to the end of the second object
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color. Merge these pairs into a single object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object. The size of the new object is the distance from the new start index to the new end index plus one. Apply this rule for all such pairs in the input.



transformation steps: ['Identify all pairs of objects with the same color in the input sequence.', 'For each pair of objects with the same color, merge them into a single object.', 'The start index of the merged object is the same as the start index of the first object in the pair.', 'The end index of the merged object is the same as the end index of the second object in the pair.', 'The size of the merged object is calculated as the difference between the end index and the start index plus one.', "Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the newly merged object, ensuring that all pixels between the start and end index of the merged object are of the merged object's color.", "Any background pixels between the original objects are colored to match the objects' color."]

conditions: The transformation occurs when there are exactly two objects of the same color in the sequence.
overall pattern: For any input, if there are two objects of the same color, they are transformed into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object. The size is adjusted to cover the entire range, including the background that was between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects of the same color in the input sequence', 'Check if there is no other object of different color between the identified objects', 'Create a new object with the same color as the identified objects', "Set the 'start_index' of the new object to the 'start_index' of the first object", "Set the 'end_index' of the new object to the 'end_index' of the second object", "Calculate the 'size' of the new object by subtracting the 'start_index' from the 'end_index' and adding 1", 'Replace the two original objects with the new single object in the output sequence', "Fill in all positions between the 'start_index' and 'end_index' of the new object with its color", 'Ensure that the dimension of the output sequence remains the same as the input sequence']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

overall pattern: For any input, if there are two objects of the same color, they are transformed into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object. The size is adjusted to cover the entire range, including the background that was between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects of the same color in the input sequence', 'Check if there is no other object of different color between the identified objects', 'Create a new object with the same color as the identified objects', "Set the 'start_index' of the new object to the 'start_index' of the first object", "Set the 'end_index' of the new object to the 'end_index' of the second object", "Calculate the 'size' of the new object by subtracting the 'start_index' from the 'end_index' and adding 1", 'Replace the two original objects with the new single object in the output sequence', "Fill in all positions between the 'start_index' and 'end_index' of the new object with its color", 'Ensure that the dimension of the output sequence remains the same as the input sequence']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.
