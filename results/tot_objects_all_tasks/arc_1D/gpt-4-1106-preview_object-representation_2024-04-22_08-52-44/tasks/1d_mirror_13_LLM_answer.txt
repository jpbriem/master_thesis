You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the condition for changes seems to be based on the size of the objects and their colors. The smaller object always takes the color of the larger object, and the larger object takes the color of the smaller object.
overall pattern: The general rule for the transformation is to exchange the positions and colors of the two objects, with the smaller object (size 1) taking the color of the larger object (size greater than 1), and the larger object taking the color of the smaller object. The sizes of the objects remain unchanged. The new position of the smaller object is at its original position, while the larger object moves to occupy the space immediately after the new position of the smaller object.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the condition for changes seems to be based on the size of the objects and their colors. The smaller object always takes the color of the larger object, and the larger object takes the color of the smaller object.
overall pattern: The general rule for the transformation is to exchange the positions and colors of the two objects, with the smaller object (size 1) taking the color of the larger object (size greater than 1), and the larger object taking the color of the smaller object. The sizes of the objects remain unchanged. The new position of the smaller object is at its original position, while the larger object moves to occupy the space immediately after the new position of the smaller object.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

overall pattern:
conditions: The color and position of Object_2 in the input determine the changes. The color of Object_2 becomes the new color for both objects in the output. The position of Object_2 determines the new starting position of Object_1 after the transformation

transformation steps: ['Identify Object_1 and Object_2 in the input sequence.', 'Record the color of Object_2; this will be the new color for both objects in the output sequence.', 'Record the start_index of Object_2; this will determine the new start_index for Object_1 in the output sequence.', 'Change the color of Object_1 to match the color of Object_2.', 'Change the color of Object_2 to match the new color of Object_1 (which is now the same as the original color of Object_2).', 'Move Object_1 to a new position starting 3 indices forward from the original start_index of Object_2.', 'The size of Object_1 remains unchanged.', 'Place Object_2 at its original position in the input sequence.', 'Fill the rest of the sequence with the background color (0) to maintain the original dimension.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

transformation steps: ['Identify Object_1 and Object_2 in the input sequence.', 'Record the color of Object_2; this will be the new color for both objects in the output sequence.', 'Record the start_index of Object_2; this will determine the new start_index for Object_1 in the output sequence.', 'Change the color of Object_1 to match the color of Object_2.', 'Change the color of Object_2 to match the new color of Object_1 (which is now the same as the original color of Object_2).', 'Move Object_1 to a new position starting 3 indices forward from the original start_index of Object_2.', 'The size of Object_1 remains unchanged.', 'Place Object_2 at its original position in the input sequence.', 'Fill the rest of the sequence with the background color (0) to maintain the original dimension.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
