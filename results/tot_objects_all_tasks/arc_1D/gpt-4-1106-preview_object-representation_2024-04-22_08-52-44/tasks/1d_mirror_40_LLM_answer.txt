You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation involves swapping colors and positions between two objects, where one object has a fixed color (9). The object with the fixed color moves to the position where the first object started, and the first object moves to the right by a distance equal to its size. The size of the objects does not change.
overall pattern: For any input with two objects where one object has the color 9: Swap the colors of the two objects. Move the object that originally had color 9 to the starting position of the other object. Move the other object to the right by a distance equal to its size. Keep the sizes of the objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Check which object has the color value of 9.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects, so the object that did not initially have color 9 now has color 9, and vice versa.', 'Calculate the size of the object that initially had a color other than 9.', 'Move the object that now has color 9 to the starting position of the original first object.', 'Move the other object (which initially had color 9) to the right by a distance equal to its size.', 'Keep the sizes of both objects unchanged during the transformation.']

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 6}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation involves swapping colors and positions between two objects, where one object has a fixed color (9). The object with the fixed color moves to the position where the first object started, and the first object moves to the right by a distance equal to its size. The size of the objects does not change.
overall pattern: For any input with two objects where one object has the color 9: Swap the colors of the two objects. Move the object that originally had color 9 to the starting position of the other object. Move the other object to the right by a distance equal to its size. Keep the sizes of the objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Check which object has the color value of 9.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects, so the object that did not initially have color 9 now has color 9, and vice versa.', 'Calculate the size of the object that initially had a color other than 9.', 'Move the object that now has color 9 to the starting position of the original first object.', 'Move the other object (which initially had color 9) to the right by a distance equal to its size.', 'Keep the sizes of both objects unchanged during the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 23],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 23]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}

The colors were correctly swapped between the two objects, but the positions were not updated as per the instructions. The object that originally had color 9 and then received color 7 should have been moved to the right by a distance equal to its size, which is 6. Therefore, the start_index of Object_2 should have been 1 + 6 = 7, and the end_index should have been 7 + 6 - 1 = 12, which is correct. However, the object that now has color 9 should have remained at the starting position of the original first object, which should be start_index 1 and end_index 1, which is also correct. The sizes of the objects were kept unchanged, which aligns with the transformation pattern.

However, the position of the object with the new color 9 (originally color 7) is correctly placed at the start index of the original first object, fulfilling step 5. But the other object, which should now have color 7 and should move to the right by a distance equal to its size (6 places from the original position of the first object starting at index 1), is incorrectly placed. According to the transformation steps, it should start at index 1 + 6 = 7, which is correct, but it should end at index 7 + 6 - 1 = 12, as the size is 6. Therefore, the end index should be one less than the sum due to zero-indexing, but the test output has correctly calculated this as 12. Hence, only the initial placement of the second object is not following the transformation rules.",
