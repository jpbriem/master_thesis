You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object in each example increases in size by expanding to the right and stops one position before the second object, which remains unchanged.
overall pattern: The transformation rule is that the first object extends its size towards the right until it reaches one position before the second object. The color and position of the first object's start_index remain the same, while the end_index changes based on the position of the second object. The second object is unaffected by the transformation.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: Any object that is not the rightmost object expands towards the right until it is one index before the next object, regardless of color or initial size.
overall pattern: For any object that is not at the end of the sequence, increase the size of the object so its end_index is one less than the start_index of the object to its right. Maintain the original color of the object. The rightmost object remains unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, except for the rightmost object, determine the start index of the next object to the right.', 'Expand the end index of each object (except the rightmost) to be one less than the start index of the next object.', 'Ensure that the color of the object remains the same after expansion.', 'Leave the rightmost object unchanged in terms of size, position, and color.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the newly calculated end indices for the expanded objects and the original rightmost object.']

overall pattern: For any object that is not at the end of the sequence, increase the size of the object so its end_index is one less than the start_index of the object to its right. Maintain the original color of the object. The rightmost object remains unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, except for the rightmost object, determine the start index of the next object to the right.', 'Expand the end index of each object (except the rightmost) to be one less than the start index of the next object.', 'Ensure that the color of the object remains the same after expansion.', 'Leave the rightmost object unchanged in terms of size, position, and color.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the newly calculated end indices for the expanded objects and the original rightmost object.']

Value Prompt:

system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object in each example increases in size by expanding to the right and stops one position before the second object, which remains unchanged.
overall pattern: The transformation rule is that the first object extends its size towards the right until it reaches one position before the second object. The color and position of the first object's start_index remain the same, while the end_index changes based on the position of the second object. The second object is unaffected by the transformation.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first and second objects in the sequence.', 'Record the start_index and color of the first object.', 'Record the start_index of the second object.', 'Calculate the new end_index for the first object by subtracting one from the start_index of the second object.', 'Extend the first object to the right by filling the spaces between the old end_index and the new end_index with the color of the first object.', 'Ensure that the second object remains the same in terms of color, size, and position.', 'Update the size of the first object to reflect the new end_index.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 19],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 19]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
