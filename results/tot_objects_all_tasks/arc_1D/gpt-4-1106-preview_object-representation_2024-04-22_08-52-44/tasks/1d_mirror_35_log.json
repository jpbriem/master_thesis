However, there are discrepancies when considering the transformation steps in detail. According to the transformation pattern, the second object should move to a new starting index which is two positions to the right of its original starting index. In the test case, the second object's original starting index was 11. Therefore, the new starting index should be 11 + 2 = 13. The test output correctly reflects this change with the second object starting at index 13. However, the size of the transformed second object is given as 7, which is supposed to match the original size of the first object. The original size of the first object was 7, thus the test output correctly extends the size of the second object to 7. The test output is consistent with the transformation steps and the overall pattern, with the first object taking the color and position of the second object while shrinking to a size of 1, and the second object taking the color of the first object and moving to a new index two positions to the right of its original starting index, with its size matching the original size of the first object.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.

The second object takes the color of the first object and moves to a new position further to the right, taking the size of the first object.\noverall pattern: The transformation pattern involves a swap of colors and positions between two objects, with the first object shrinking to a size of 1 and the second object taking the original size of the first object.

According to the transformation steps, Object_1 should swap colors with Object_2, so Object_1 should become color 9. This is done correctly in the test output. Then, Object_1 should move to the starting index of Object_2, which is index 11, and its size should change to 1. This is also done correctly in the test output. Object_2 should take the color of the original Object_1, which is color 2, and move to a new starting index which is two positions to the right of its original starting index.
