You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects expand to fill the space between them when they are a consistent number of indices apart
overall pattern: if two objects are separated by a consistent gap of n zeros, they expand to fill the gap, increasing their size to n+1 and covering the range from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'Check the number of zero pixels (background pixels) between consecutive objects', 'If the gap of zeros between any two consecutive objects is consistent, proceed to the next step; otherwise, do not transform these objects', 'For each pair of consecutive objects with a consistent gap, expand both objects to cover the entire range from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object', 'The size of the expanded object is set to the gap size plus one', 'The color of the expanded object remains the same as the original objects', 'Repeat this expansion process for all pairs of objects with a consistent gap', 'Leave any objects that do not have a consistent gap of zeros between them unchanged', 'Output the transformed sequence with the expanded objects']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge if they are separated by a constant number of empty spaces that is one less than their original size
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a separation of empty spaces one less than their size, merge these objects to form a new object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, inclusive


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if there is another object of the same color with the required separation.', 'If the separation between two objects matches the condition (equal to one less than their original size), merge the two objects.', "The new object's color remains the same as the original objects.", "The new object's start index is the start index of the first object in the pair.", "The new object's end index is the end index of the second object in the pair.", 'The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the separation spaces.', 'Remove the original objects from the sequence and replace them with the new merged object.', 'Repeat the process for all pairs of objects that meet the condition.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the merged objects.']

overall pattern:
conditions: objects expand to fill the space between them when they are a consistent number of indices apart
overall pattern: if two objects are separated by a consistent gap of n zeros, they expand to fill the gap, increasing their size to n+1 and covering the range from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'Check the number of zero pixels (background pixels) between consecutive objects', 'If the gap of zeros between any two consecutive objects is consistent, proceed to the next step; otherwise, do not transform these objects', 'For each pair of consecutive objects with a consistent gap, expand both objects to cover the entire range from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object', 'The size of the expanded object is set to the gap size plus one', 'The color of the expanded object remains the same as the original objects', 'Repeat this expansion process for all pairs of objects with a consistent gap', 'Leave any objects that do not have a consistent gap of zeros between them unchanged', 'Output the transformed sequence with the expanded objects']

input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were not correctly applied to the test input. According to the overall pattern, objects expand to fill the space between them when they are a consistent number of indices apart. The input objects are separated by consistent gaps of 4 zeros (background pixels) between them: Object_1 is followed by 4 zeros before Object_2, Object_2 is followed by 4 zeros before Object_3, and so on. The transformation rules specify that the objects should expand to fill these gaps, such that each object's size becomes the gap size plus one. Therefore, Object_1 should expand to cover indices 1 to 6 (inclusive), Object_2 should expand to cover indices 6 to 11, Object_3 should expand to cover indices 11 to 16, Object_4 should expand to cover indices 16 to 21, and Object_5 should expand to cover indices 21 to 26. However, this would result in overlapping objects, which is not accounted for in the transformation steps provided. The correct transformation according to the rules should result in each object having a size of 6 and spanning 6 indices. The test output indicates that each object has a size of 5 instead of the expected size of 6, and the objects' start indices are correctly identified but the end indices are off by one. The objects should span from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object in each consecutive pair, leading to a size of 6 for each transformed object.",
