You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern involves swapping the colors of the two objects and moving their positions. The smaller object (size 1) seems to always move to the initial position of the larger object. The larger object moves to the right, with its new starting index being after the new position of the smaller object, with a consistent gap that matches the original size of the larger object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence with two objects, the output sequence will have the same number of objects with their colors swapped. The smaller object (always with size 1) will move to the original starting index of the larger object. The larger object will move to a new starting index that is after the new position of the smaller object, offset by a distance that equals the original size of the larger object. The original size of the larger object also appears to inform how far to the right the larger object moves from the smaller object's new position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 9 remain in place, while objects with other colors swap their color with the color of the object with color 9 and move to the right by a number of indices equal to the size of the object with a different color.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: if an object has color 9, it retains its position and color. The other object swaps its color with the object that has color 9 and moves to the right by a number of indices equal to its own size.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern involves swapping the colors of the two objects and moving their positions. The smaller object (size 1) seems to always move to the initial position of the larger object. The larger object moves to the right, with its new starting index being after the new position of the smaller object, with a consistent gap that matches the original size of the larger object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence with two objects, the output sequence will have the same number of objects with their colors swapped. The smaller object (always with size 1) will move to the original starting index of the larger object. The larger object will move to a new starting index that is after the new position of the smaller object, offset by a distance that equals the original size of the larger object. The original size of the larger object also appears to inform how far to the right the larger object moves from the smaller object's new position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 9}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 9 remain in place, while objects with other colors swap their color with the color of the object with color 9 and move to the right by a number of indices equal to the size of the object with a different color.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: if an object has color 9, it retains its position and color. The other object swaps its color with the object that has color 9 and moves to the right by a number of indices equal to its own size.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object with color 9 and note its position and size', 'Identify the object with a color other than 9, note its color, position, and size', 'Leave the position and size of the object with color 9 unchanged in the output sequence', 'Change the color of the non-color-9 object to 9', 'Move the non-color-9 object to the right by a number of indices equal to its original size', 'Change the color of the object that was originally color 9 to the original color of the non-color-9 object', 'The size of the objects remains unchanged throughout the transformation']

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern involves swapping the colors of the two objects and moving their positions. The smaller object (size 1) seems to always move to the initial position of the larger object. The larger object moves to the right, with its new starting index being after the new position of the smaller object, with a consistent gap that matches the original size of the larger object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence with two objects, the output sequence will have the same number of objects with their colors swapped. The smaller object (always with size 1) will move to the original starting index of the larger object. The larger object will move to a new starting index that is after the new position of the smaller object, offset by a distance that equals the original size of the larger object. The original size of the larger object also appears to inform how far to the right the larger object moves from the smaller object's new position.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence and determine their colors, sizes, and starting indices.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Move the object of size 1 to the starting index of the originally larger object.', 'Calculate the new starting index for the originally larger object, which will be the starting index of the object of size 1 after swapping plus the original size of the larger object.', 'Move the originally larger object to its new starting index, ensuring it does not overlap with the smaller object.', 'If necessary, adjust the positions of the objects to maintain the same sequence dimension and to ensure no new objects are created in the process.', 'The output sequence should reflect the changes in color and position, with all other pixels remaining as the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation pattern involves swapping the colors of the two objects and moving their positions. The smaller object (size 1) seems to always move to the initial position of the larger object. The larger object moves to the right, with its new starting index being after the new position of the smaller object, with a consistent gap that matches the original size of the larger object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence with two objects, the output sequence will have the same number of objects with their colors swapped. The smaller object (always with size 1) will move to the original starting index of the larger object. The larger object will move to a new starting index that is after the new position of the smaller object, offset by a distance that equals the original size of the larger object. The original size of the larger object also appears to inform how far to the right the larger object moves from the smaller object's new position.
