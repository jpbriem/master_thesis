For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 8}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The objects change when there are two separate objects of the same color. The change involves merging these objects into a single object\noverall pattern: For any input, if there are two objects of the same color, they are merged into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object, thereby changing its size to cover the range between the two original objects\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the first object and record its color and start_index.', 'Identify the second object of the same color and record its end_index.', 'Create a new object of the same color that starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the second object.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by subtracting the start_index of the first object from the end_index of the second object and adding 1.', 'Replace the sequence between the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the second object with the color of the objects to form the new object.', 'Leave the rest of the sequence unchanged.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
