The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

Since Object_1 is the largest with a size of 2, its color is correctly changed to 8. Object_2 and Object_3 are both the smallest with a size of 1, so their colors are correctly changed to 2. The start and end indices, as well as the sizes of the objects, remain unchanged, which is also in line with the transformation rules.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"In the given test case, there are three objects with the original color 5, which according to the transformation steps should be changed based on their size. Object_1 is the largest with a size of 2, and Object_2 and Object_3 are the smallest with a size of 1. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, Object_1's color should be changed to 8, and Object_2 and Object_3's colors should be changed to 2. The test output shows that the transformation was correctly applied, as Object_1 is now color 8, and both Object_2 and Object_3 are now color 2. The start and end indices and sizes of the objects are unchanged, which is consistent with the rules. Therefore, the test output has been transformed correctly from the test input.\", \"value\": 10}"
