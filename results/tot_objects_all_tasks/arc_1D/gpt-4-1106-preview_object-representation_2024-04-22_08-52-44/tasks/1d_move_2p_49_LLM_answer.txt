You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

{"test_output_analysis": "After examining the test case, it appears that the transformation has a discrepancy. The input object starts at index 6 and ends at index 21, which means it should be moved 2 positions to the right to start at index 8 and end at index 23, as per the transformation rule. However, this would result in an object size of 16, which exceeds the sequence dimension of [1, 29]. An object that starts at index 8 and ends at index 23 has a size of 16, which is correct, but it would mean the object overflows beyond the limit of the sequence dimension, which is not accounted for in the transformation steps. The sequence dimension should constrain the object such that it cannot exceed the last index of 28. Therefore, the correct end_index should be 22, not 23, to maintain the object size of 16 within the sequence boundary. The test output does not address this constraint.", "value": 0}

input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 9}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 11}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 8}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation of objects is independent of color, initial position, and size. All objects are treated the same.
overall pattern: For any input, each object shifts 2 positions to the right while maintaining its original color and size.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object in the input sequence.', 'Shift the entire object exactly 2 positions to the right within the sequence.', 'Keep the color of the object unchanged during the shift.', 'Ensure the size of the object remains constant after the transformation.', "Fill any positions left by the object's shift with the background color (0).", 'Retain the dimension of the input sequence in the output sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 16}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 29]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 16}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly follows the transformation steps. The object in the input sequence, which is of color 2 and size 16, begins at start_index 6 and ends at end_index 21. According to the overall pattern, the object should shift 2 positions to the right. The test output shows that the start_index is now 8 and the end_index is 23, which is exactly 2 positions to the right of the original indices, maintaining the object's size of 16. The color of the object remains the same, and the dimension of the output sequence is unchanged at [1, 29]. Thus, all transformation steps appear to have been correctly applied.", "value": 10}

  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation instructions were followed correctly. The initial object with color 2, starting at index 6 and ending at index 21, was shifted two positions to the right, resulting in a start index of 8 and an end index of 23, maintaining the object's color and size of 16. The transformation preserved the dimension of the sequence, and the positions left by the object's shift were filled with the background color (0).",
