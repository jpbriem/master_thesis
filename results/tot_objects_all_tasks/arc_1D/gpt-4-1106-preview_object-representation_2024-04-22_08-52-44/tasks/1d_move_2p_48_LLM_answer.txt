You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition for the change across all examples is the movement of the object two positions to the right. This is independent of the object's color and size.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, to transform it into its output, each object should be moved two positions to the right, maintaining their original color and size. This is the only transformation applied, regardless of the object's initial position, color, or size.



transformation steps: ['Identify the object in the input sequence by finding consecutive non-zero pixels.', 'Note the original color and size of the object.', 'Move the object two positions to the right by changing the start_index and end_index of the object by adding 2 to both.', 'Ensure the object maintains its original color and size during the move.', 'Fill any gaps left by the original position of the object with the background color, represented by 0.']

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved to the right based on a fraction of their size. The fraction appears to be one-third of the size, rounded down.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each object in the input, move it to the right by a distance equal to one-third of its size rounded down. Maintain the object's color and size unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence by locating consecutive pixels of the same color that are not background (color value 0).', 'Calculate the size of each object by subtracting its start_index from its end_index and adding one.', 'Compute the move distance for each object by taking one-third of its size and rounding down to the nearest integer.', "Move each object to the right by the calculated move distance, ensuring that the object's color and size remain unchanged.", 'Fill the space the object occupied before moving with the background color (0) up to the new start_index of the object.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the objects in their new positions.']

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: The consistent condition for the change across all examples is the movement of the object two positions to the right. This is independent of the object's color and size.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, to transform it into its output, each object should be moved two positions to the right, maintaining their original color and size. This is the only transformation applied, regardless of the object's initial position, color, or size.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object in the input sequence by finding consecutive non-zero pixels.', 'Note the original color and size of the object.', 'Move the object two positions to the right by changing the start_index and end_index of the object by adding 2 to both.', 'Ensure the object maintains its original color and size during the move.', 'Fill any gaps left by the original position of the object with the background color, represented by 0.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 27],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 27]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 7}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output shows that the object originally from index 5 to 11 of color 7 and size 7 has been moved two positions to the right, resulting in a new position from index 7 to 13, maintaining its original color and size. This change adheres to the described transformation pattern and steps. The object has been correctly identified, its original color and size noted, and it has been moved two positions to the right without altering its color or size. The transformation steps have been correctly applied.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the overall pattern and the transformation steps correctly. The object in the test input has been moved two positions to the right without changing its color or size, as required by the transformation pattern. The start_index and end_index have both been incremented by 2, and the object's size remains unchanged at 7. This indicates that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.", "value": 10}
