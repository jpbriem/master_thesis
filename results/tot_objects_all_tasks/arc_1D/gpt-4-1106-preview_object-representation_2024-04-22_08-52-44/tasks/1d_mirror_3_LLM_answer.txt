You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: An object with color 9 stays in its original position and swaps color with the other object. The other object, which does not have color 9, moves to the right by a distance that appears to be related to a function of its size
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the object with color 9 and any additional objects. Keep the object with color 9 stationary, swap its color with the other object. Move the non-color-9 object to the right by a distance that is a function of its size. This function seems to be either adding 2 or subtracting 4 from the size of the object to determine the distance to move. The specific function applied may depend on additional conditions not illustrated by the examples provided

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to sequences with two objects: one single-pixel object and one multi-pixel object. The single-pixel object remains stationary while the multi-pixel object moves to the right by the size of the stationary object plus a number of indices that could be related to the size of the multi-pixel object. The objects swap colors.
overall pattern: For any input, identify the single-pixel and multi-pixel objects. The multi-pixel object moves to the right by an offset determined by the size of the single-pixel object plus a certain number of indices. The objects swap colors. The specifics of the offset need to be determined by additional examples or rules.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:

overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify the objects; swap their colors; move the object that had color 9 to the starting position of the other object with an offset equal to the difference in their original starting positions; move the other object to the starting position of the object that had color 9 with an offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects.', 'Calculate the distance between the starting positions of the two objects.', 'Move the object that originally had color 9 to the starting position of the other object plus the distance calculated in the previous step.', 'Move the other object to the starting position of the object that originally had color 9, with an additional offset equal to the size of the object that originally had color 9 (which is 1).', 'Ensure that the objects retain their original sizes after the swap.']

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap their positions and colors with each other; the color of each object changes to the color of the other object; the object that had color 9 retains its size but shifts its starting position to the original starting position of the other object with an offset that is equal to the difference between the original starting positions of the two objects; the object that did not have color 9 retains its size and shifts its starting position to the original starting position of the object that had color 9, plus an offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9
overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify the objects; swap their colors; move the object that had color 9 to the starting position of the other object with an offset equal to the difference in their original starting positions; move the other object to the starting position of the object that had color 9 with an offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects.', 'Calculate the distance between the starting positions of the two objects.', 'Move the object that originally had color 9 to the starting position of the other object plus the distance calculated in the previous step.', 'Move the other object to the starting position of the object that originally had color 9, with an additional offset equal to the size of the object that originally had color 9 (which is 1).', 'Ensure that the objects retain their original sizes after the swap.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 6}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 5}

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap their positions and colors with each other; the color of each object changes to the color of the other object; the object that had color 9 retains its size but shifts its starting position to the original starting position of the other object with an offset that is equal to the difference between the original starting positions of the two objects; the object that did not have color 9 retains its size and shifts its starting position to the original starting position of the object that had color 9, plus an offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9
overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify the objects; swap their colors; move the object that had color 9 to the starting position of the other object with an offset equal to the difference in their original starting positions; move the other object to the starting position of the object that had color 9 with an offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Swap the colors of the two objects.', 'Calculate the distance between the starting positions of the two objects.', 'Move the object that originally had color 9 to the starting position of the other object plus the distance calculated in the previous step.', 'Move the other object to the starting position of the object that originally had color 9, with an additional offset equal to the size of the object that originally had color 9 (which is 1).', 'Ensure that the objects retain their original sizes after the swap.']

transformed objects: [{'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, {'color': 4, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 5}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not follow the transformation pattern correctly. According to the pattern, the object that originally had color 9 should move to the starting position of the other object plus the distance between their starting positions. The distance between the starting positions of Object_1 and Object_2 is 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, the object that originally had color 9 should move to position 2 + 7 = 9. This part is correct, as we can see that the object with color 9 in the output starts at index 9. However, the second object, which originally had color 4, should move to the starting position of the object that had color 9, with an additional offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9, which is 1 in this case. Since the original starting position of the object with color 9 is 9, Object_1 should be moved to index 9 + 1 = 10. This is correctly reflected in the output, as the object with color 4 starts at index 10. However, the end index of Object_2 should be 10 + 5 - 1 = 14, as it retains its original size of 5. The output correctly shows the end index of Object_2 as 14. The transformation seems to be applied correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not match the overall pattern described. According to the transformation pattern, the object that originally had color 9 should move to the starting position of the other object with an offset equal to the difference in their original starting positions. In the test case, the original starting positions of the objects are 2 for Object_1 and 9 for Object_2. The distance between them is 7. Therefore, the new starting position for the object that originally had color 9 should be 2 + 7 = 9, which is correct. However, the other object, which originally had color 4, should move to the starting position of the object that had color 9 (which is 9), with an additional offset equal to the size of the object that had color 9 (which is 1). This means the object that originally had color 4 should start at position 9 + 1 = 10. The test output correctly places the start of the object that originally had color 4 at position 10. However, the end_index is incorrect. If the object starts at position 10 and has a size of 5, the end_index should be 10 + 5 - 1 = 14. The end_index in the test output is 14, which is correct. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.",
