The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

According to the transformation steps, each object should be moved to the right by an amount equal to half its size. For an object of size 5, this means moving it to the right by 2 places (since half of 5 is 2.5, which is rounded down to 2). The test case output shows the object moved to the right by the correct number of places, starting at index 2 and ending at index 6, maintaining its size of 5 and color 4. The dimension of the sequence has been maintained as [1, 12], and the spaces left by the moved object are correctly filled with the background color (0). Furthermore, the boundary condition does not apply here since the object can be moved without exceeding the dimension boundary.

This means the object should move by 2 places to the right. The start index of the object in the input is 0, so adding 2 to this value gives us the correct start index of 2 in the output. The end index in the input is 4, and after moving the object by 2 places, the new end index should be 6, which matches the given test case output. The color remains 4, and the size remains 5, both of which are correct according to the transformation steps. The dimension of the input and output sequence is maintained as [1, 12]. Spaces left by the moved object are filled with the background color (0), which is implied, though not explicitly given in the test case output.
