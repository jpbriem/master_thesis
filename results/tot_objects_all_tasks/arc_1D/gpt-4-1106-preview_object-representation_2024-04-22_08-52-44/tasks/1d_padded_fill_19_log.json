The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

The first and second objects merge, as do the third and fourth, and the fifth and sixth.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects that are separated by a consistent number of background pixels and merge them into a single object. The new object's start_index is the start_index of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is the end_index of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the distance of background pixels between them. This rule applies regardless of the color of the objects.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Group objects into pairs: first and second, third and fourth, fifth and sixth.', 'For each pair, calculate the distance between the end_index of the first object and the start_index of the second object.', 'Merge each identified pair of objects into a new object where:', '  - The color of the new object is the same as the original objects.', '  - The start_index of the new object is the start_index of the first object in the pair.', '  - The end_index of the new object is the end_index of the second object in the pair.', '  - The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance of background pixels between them.', 'Remove all original objects that were part of a pair from the sequence.', 'Insert the new merged objects into the sequence at the position of the first object in each pair.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers\ntransformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output was not provided, therefore it is not possible to analyze the transformation steps and evaluate if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.
