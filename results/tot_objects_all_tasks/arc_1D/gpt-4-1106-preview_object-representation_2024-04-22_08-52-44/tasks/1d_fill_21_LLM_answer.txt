You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: if objects of the same color are separated by background, they are subject to merging
overall pattern: merge objects of the same color into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Check if there are exactly two objects of that color.', 'If condition is met, merge the two objects into a single object.', 'Set the start index of the new object to the start index of the first object.', 'Set the end index of the new object to the end index of the second object.', 'Fill all indices between the new start and end index with the color of the merged objects.', 'Remove the original two objects from the sequence.', 'Replace the sequence span of the original objects with the new merged object.']

output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation applies to pairs of objects of the same color
overall pattern: merge objects of the same color into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object, thereby increasing its size to cover the entire range between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each pair of objects with the same color, check if there are only background pixels between them.', 'If the condition is met, create a new object with the same color.', 'Set the start_index of the new object to the start_index of the first object in the pair.', 'Set the end_index of the new object to the end_index of the second object in the pair.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by subtracting the start_index from the end_index and adding 1.', 'Replace the two original objects with the new object in the output sequence.', "Fill in all indices between the new start_index and end_index with the object's color.", 'Maintain the same dimension for the output sequence as the input sequence.', 'Leave all other pixels unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 17],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: if objects of the same color are separated by background, they are subject to merging
overall pattern: merge objects of the same color into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the last object of that color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Check if there are exactly two objects of that color.', 'If condition is met, merge the two objects into a single object.', 'Set the start index of the new object to the start index of the first object.', 'Set the end index of the new object to the end index of the second object.', 'Fill all indices between the new start and end index with the color of the merged objects.', 'Remove the original two objects from the sequence.', 'Replace the sequence span of the original objects with the new merged object.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 17],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.
