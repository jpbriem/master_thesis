Step 1 identified the object in the input sequence. In step 2, the size of the original object was changed to 1 while retaining its original color and start_index, resulting in Object_1 with the specified properties. In step 3, a new object of size 1 with the same color as the original object was created at the original end_index of the object, resulting in Object_2. Step 4 ensured that all other pixels that were part of the original object were set to 0, which is implied as there are only two objects of size 1 in the output and the dimension remained unchanged. Step 5 confirms that the output contains two objects of size 1 for the original object, one at the original start_index and one at the original end_index. Since the test output aligns with the described transformation pattern and steps, it is correct.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output correctly identifies the two objects that result from the transformation of the input sequence. The pattern observed from the examples provided indicates that for any object, its size should be reduced to 1 at the start_index, and a new object of size 1 should be created at the original end_index. The test output follows this pattern accurately. Object_1 retains its color 6 and is correctly reduced to size 1 at the original start_index 4. A new Object_2 of color 6 and size 1 is correctly created at the original end_index 20. All other pixels that were part of the original object are presumably set to 0, as per the transformation steps, although the exact state of all pixels in the sequence is not described. Based on the information provided, the transformation appears to have been applied correctly.\", \"value\": 10}"
