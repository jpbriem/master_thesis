The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change?

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 2}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 2}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change color based on their sizes and/or their relative positions; larger objects change to color 7 and smaller objects to color 1\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output: For each object, if it is the largest object, change its color to 7. If it is not the largest object, change its color to 1. Keep the position and size of the objects the same.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Find the largest object size in the sequence.', 'For each object, compare its size to the largest object size found:', \" - If the object size is equal to the largest object size, change the object's color to 7.\", \" - If the object size is smaller than the largest object size, change the object's color to 1.\", 'Maintain the positions and sizes of all objects in the output sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
