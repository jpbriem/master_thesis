The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The first object with color 4 starts at index 0, and based on the overall pattern, it needs to start at index 3. The object is correctly shifted to the right by 3 positions without changing its size or color. The object then starts at index 3 and ends at index 5, which is consistent with maintaining its size of 3. The second object with color 8 is already at the correct position, starting at index 6, and remains unchanged. All transformation steps are applied correctly, and the output maintains the dimension, object color, and object size as per the instructions. The background is implicitly filled with 0, as no specific action is required for that part of the sequence.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"The given test output matches the transformation pattern and steps exactly. The first object, which is colored 4 and spans indices 0 to 2 (size 3), has been correctly shifted to the right to start at index 3, now spanning indices 3 to 5, while maintaining its size and color. The second object, which is colored 8 and at index 6 (size 1), has been correctly left unchanged, as specified by the transformation steps. The output sequence dimension remains [1, 7], which is also correct. There are no gaps in the sequence, as the first object's shift fills the previous positions of the first object with the background color, which is also correct according to the transformation steps.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n###########################################################\nNo Valuation - Duplicate candidate"
