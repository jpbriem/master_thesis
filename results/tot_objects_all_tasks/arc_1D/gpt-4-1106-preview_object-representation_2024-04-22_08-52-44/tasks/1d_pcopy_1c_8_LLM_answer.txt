You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects with size 1, which are scaled to size 3, regardless of their color. Their position is also shifted to the left by one
overall pattern: Objects with size greater than 1 remain unchanged. Objects with size 1 are scaled up to size 3, their start_index is decreased by 1, and their end_index is increased by 2, effectively making them 3 pixels long and moving them one position to the left

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to single-sized objects of the same color following an object of larger size. The color of the objects does not change.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects with size 1, which are scaled to size 3, regardless of their color. Their position is also shifted to the left by one
overall pattern: Objects with size greater than 1 remain unchanged. Objects with size 1 are scaled up to size 3, their start_index is decreased by 1, and their end_index is increased by 2, effectively making them 3 pixels long and moving them one position to the left


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1:', '  Increase the size of the object to 3.', '  Move the start_index of the object to the left by 1, if possible.', '  Extend the end_index of the object to the right by 2.', 'Leave all objects of size greater than 1 unchanged in their original positions.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects with size 1, which are scaled to size 3, regardless of their color. Their position is also shifted to the left by one
overall pattern: Objects with size greater than 1 remain unchanged. Objects with size 1 are scaled up to size 3, their start_index is decreased by 1, and their end_index is increased by 2, effectively making them 3 pixels long and moving them one position to the left


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of size 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object of size 1:', '  Increase the size of the object to 3.', '  Move the start_index of the object to the left by 1, if possible.', '  Extend the end_index of the object to the right by 2.', 'Leave all objects of size greater than 1 unchanged in their original positions.']

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object of size 1, check if there is a preceding object of the same color that is larger.', 'If such a preceding object exists, expand the size 1 object to size 3.', "Shift the expanded object's position one index to the left.", 'Keep the color of the object unchanged.', 'Repeat the process for all eligible size 1 objects in the sequence.', 'Maintain the sequence dimension and background color.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 33]
transformed objects: [{'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, {'color': 5, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}]

  "test_output_analysis": "The test output shows that the transformation was applied correctly based on the given pattern. Each single-sized object (size 1) following a larger object of the same color in the input sequence has been expanded to size 3 and shifted left by one position, while maintaining the original color. The dimensions of the sequence have not changed, and the background remains the same. The transformation steps have been correctly followed for all eligible size 1 objects.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has correctly followed the transformation steps. All objects in the input sequence were identified. Each object of size 1 was checked for a preceding object of the same color that is larger, which in this case was Object_1. The size 1 objects (Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4) were correctly expanded to size 3, and their positions were shifted to the left by one index. The color of the objects remained unchanged. The sequence dimension and background color were maintained in the output. The transformation was performed correctly for all eligible size 1 objects in the sequence.",
