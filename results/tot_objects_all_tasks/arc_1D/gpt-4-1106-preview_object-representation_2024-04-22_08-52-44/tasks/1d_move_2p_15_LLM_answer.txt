You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Value Prompt:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move to the right by a number of places equal to half their size (rounded down if the size is odd).
overall pattern: Each object, regardless of color, is moved to the right by an amount equal to half its size. There are no changes to the color or size of the object, and no new objects are created.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence by detecting consecutive non-zero pixels.', 'Calculate half the size of each object. If the size is odd, round down the result.', 'Move each object to the right by the calculated number of places.', 'Ensure that the original size and color of the object remain unchanged after the move.', 'Maintain the dimension of the input sequence in the output sequence.', 'Fill in the spaces left by the moved objects with background color (0).', 'If an object cannot be moved the calculated number of places without exceeding the dimension boundary, move the object as far as possible without exceeding the boundary.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 12],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 12]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The given test case input describes a single object of color 4 with a size of 5, starting at index 0 and ending at index 4. According to the transformation steps, each object should be moved to the right by an amount equal to half its size. For an object of size 5, this means moving it to the right by 2 places (since half of 5 is 2.5, which is rounded down to 2). The test case output shows the object moved to the right by the correct number of places, starting at index 2 and ending at index 6, maintaining its size of 5 and color 4. The dimension of the sequence has been maintained as [1, 12], and the spaces left by the moved object are correctly filled with the background color (0). Furthermore, the boundary condition does not apply here since the object can be moved without exceeding the dimension boundary. All transformation steps appear to have been correctly applied.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case input has an object of size 5 (odd number), which according to the overall pattern should be moved to the right by half its size, rounded down. This means the object should move by 2 places to the right. The start index of the object in the input is 0, so adding 2 to this value gives us the correct start index of 2 in the output. The end index in the input is 4, and after moving the object by 2 places, the new end index should be 6, which matches the given test case output. The color remains 4, and the size remains 5, both of which are correct according to the transformation steps. The dimension of the input and output sequence is maintained as [1, 12]. Spaces left by the moved object are filled with the background color (0), which is implied, though not explicitly given in the test case output. The object has been moved correctly without exceeding the dimension boundary. All transformation steps have been followed correctly.",
