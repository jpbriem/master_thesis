The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The second object, which is a single-pixel object, remains the same in all examples. The expansion of the first object does not seem to depend on its color or initial size.\noverall pattern: The general rule for transforming any input into its output based on these examples is to expand the size of the first object in the sequence by a specific number of units to the right, while leaving single-pixel objects and other subsequent objects unchanged.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The pattern states that the largest object should increase in size by the difference between its current size and the index following its end index. For the test case input, Object_1 is the largest object with a size of 11 and an end_index of 11. According to the pattern, the size should increase by the difference between the size (11) and the index following the end index (11 + 1 = 12), which is 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, the correct new size should be 11 + 1 = 12 and the end_index should be updated to 11 + 1 = 12. However, this is exactly what has been done in the test output. The output has correctly transformed Object_1's end_index to 12 and size to 12, and Object_2 remains unchanged with an end_index of 14 and size of 1. The output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence as required. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly, and the test output should be rated highly.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"To evaluate the test output, let's apply the transformation steps to the test input. First, we scan the sequence and identify two objects. Object_1 has a color of 5, starts at index 1, ends at index 11, and has a size of 11. Object_2 has a color of 6, starts and ends at index 14, and has a size of 1. Object_1 is the largest object. According to the pattern, we should increase its size by the difference between its size (11) and the index following its end index (11 + 1 = 12). The difference is 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, we should increase the size of Object_1 by 1, changing its end index to 11 + 1 = 12 and its size to 11 + 1 = 12. Object_2 remains unchanged. The dimension of the output sequence is correct. However, the test output incorrectly extends Object_1's size only by 1 instead of 5, which would have made the size 16 and the end_index 16, considering the next index after the end_index is 17, and the difference is 17 - 11 = 6.
