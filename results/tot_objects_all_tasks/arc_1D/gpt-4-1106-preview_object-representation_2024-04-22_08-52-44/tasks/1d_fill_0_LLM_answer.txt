You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 9}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color merge into a single object regardless of the distance between them.
overall pattern: When two objects have the same color, they transform into one object whose start_index is the start_index of the first object and whose end_index is the end_index of the second object, thereby increasing the size to cover the entire range between the two objects, including their original positions.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color.', 'For each color with more than one object, select the object with the smallest start_index as the starting point.', 'Select the object with the largest end_index of the same color as the ending point.', 'Create a new object with the same color that stretches from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the last object.', 'Replace all original objects of that color with the new, extended object.', 'Ensure that the size of the new object is equal to the difference between the end_index and start_index plus one.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

In this test case, the objects of color 4 should have combined into a single object with a start_index of 5 and an end_index of 14. The size of this object should be 14 - 5 + 1, which is equal to 10.

According to the transformation steps, the size of the new object should be equal to the difference between the end_index and start_index plus one. In the test case, the start_index is 5 and the end_index is 14, which should result in a size of 14 - 5 + 1 = 10. However, the size is correctly calculated as 10 in the test output. The issue is that the transformation steps indicate that the new object should stretch from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the last object, which means that all indices between them should be of the same color. The original input sequence is not provided, but assuming a correct transformation, the sequence would have all indices from 5 to 14 inclusive set to color 4. Therefore, without additional context indicating an error in the sequence transformation, the test output appears to be correct in terms of the size attribute of the transformed object.",
