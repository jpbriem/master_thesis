You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to a sequence with a single object. The change seems independent of the object's color or initial position.
overall pattern: If there is only one object in the input sequence, move that object three indices to the right, maintaining its original color and size.

Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 26}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 19}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are shifted to the right regardless of their color or size.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, shift the position of each object by 3 places to the right while keeping their color and size unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object, calculate the new start index by adding 3 to the current start index.', 'Calculate the new end index by adding 3 to the current end index.', 'Ensure the size of the object remains the same during the transformation.', 'Recolor the original position of the objects to the background color (0) from the original start index to the original end index.', 'Place the object with the same color at the new start and end index positions.', 'If the new end index exceeds the input dimension, truncate the object to fit within the dimension.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 26}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 26}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 19}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 19}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformations are not dependent on the object's color, initial position, or size.
overall pattern: For any given input, the type of object that changes is the one present, regardless of its attributes. The reason for the change is a transformation rule applied to all objects. The transformation is a positional shift of the object 3 spaces to the right.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object(s) in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check the starting and ending index of the object.', 'Move the entire object 3 positions to the right within the sequence.', 'Ensure that the size of the object remains unchanged after the transformation.', "Maintain the object's color during the transformation.", "If the object's shift reaches beyond the dimension of the sequence, wrap around or truncate as per the sequence's constraints (if applicable).", 'Fill the previous location of the object with background color (0) if the object has been moved away from that position.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 24}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.
