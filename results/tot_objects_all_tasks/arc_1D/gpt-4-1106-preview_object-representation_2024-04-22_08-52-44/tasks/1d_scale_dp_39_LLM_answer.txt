You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change in size based on their position and the distance to the next object. The first object grows to approach the next object while leaving a gap of one or two pixels, depending on its initial position.
overall pattern: If the first object does not start at index 0, it grows to leave a two-pixel gap before the next object; if it starts at index 0, it leaves only a one-pixel gap. The last object in the sequence does not change. This rule applies regardless of the color of the objects.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change in size based on their position and the distance to the next object. The first object grows to approach the next object while leaving a gap of one or two pixels, depending on its initial position.
overall pattern: If the first object does not start at index 0, it grows to leave a two-pixel gap before the next object; if it starts at index 0, it leaves only a one-pixel gap. The last object in the sequence does not change. This rule applies regardless of the color of the objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the sequence.', 'Check the starting index of the first object.', 'If the starting index of the first object is 0, expand the object until there is a one-pixel gap before the next object.', 'If the starting index of the first object is greater than 0, expand the object until there is a two-pixel gap before the next object.', 'Keep the last object in the sequence unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 12],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand to fill the space before the next object if they are not at the end of the sequence; objects at the end of the sequence remain unchanged.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each object that is not at the end of the sequence, increase its size to extend up to one position before the next object, maintaining its color and starting position. Objects that are at the end of the sequence do not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if it is immediately followed by another object or if it is the last object in the sequence.', 'If the object is immediately followed by another object, expand the size of the current object so that it ends one position before the start of the next object.', 'Maintain the color and starting position of the expanding object.', 'If the object is the last one in the sequence, do not change its size, color, or position.', 'Apply these steps sequentially from the first to the last object, ensuring that each object is processed in the context of its position relative to others.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the expanded objects and unchanged last objects.']

transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the sequence.', 'Check the starting index of the first object.', 'If the starting index of the first object is 0, expand the object until there is a one-pixel gap before the next object.', 'If the starting index of the first object is greater than 0, expand the object until there is a two-pixel gap before the next object.', 'Keep the last object in the sequence unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 12],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 12]
transformed objects: [{'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, {'color': 8, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}]

Value Outputs:
{
    "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not follow the transformation steps correctly. According to the transformation steps, if the first object's starting index is greater than 0, it should expand until there is a two-pixel gap before the next object. In the test case, Object_1 starts at index 5 and should therefore expand to leave a two-pixel gap before Object_2, which starts at index 10. This means Object_1 should expand to an end_index of 7, not 8 as shown in the test output. The correct end_index for Object_1 should be 7, and the size should be 3. The transformation has incorrectly increased the size of Object_1 to a size of 4, with an end_index of 8. Object_2 is correctly unchanged.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not follow the transformation pattern and steps correctly. The first object should be expanded to leave a two-pixel gap before the next object since its starting index is greater than 0. According to the pattern, the first object should expand from index 5 to index 7 (original size of 3) up to index 8, which will leave a gap of only one pixel before the next object starting at index 10. However, according to the transformation steps, the first object should have expanded until index 9, leaving a two-pixel gap before the next object at index 10. Therefore, the proper end index for the first object after transformation should be 9, not 8, resulting in a size of 5, not 4. The second object is correctly left unchanged.",
