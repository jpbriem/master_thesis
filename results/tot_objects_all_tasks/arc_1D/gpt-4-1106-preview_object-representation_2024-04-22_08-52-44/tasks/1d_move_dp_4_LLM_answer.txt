You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects larger than a certain size are moved to the right, the distance they are moved seems to be conditional based on their size and maybe their initial position. Objects of size 1 remain unchanged
overall pattern: For any input sequence, if an object's size is greater than 1, move the object to the right by a number of positions possibly determined by its size and/or initial position. Objects of size 1 do not change

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects other than those of color 6 are moved to the right. The distance moved seems not directly related to the size or color of the object, but it consistently changes position. Color 6 objects remain unaffected.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects (except those of color 6) to the right by a number of positions that could be determined by the object's size, color, or a combination of its characteristics.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects other than those of color 6 are moved to the right. The distance moved seems not directly related to the size or color of the object, but it consistently changes position. Color 6 objects remain unaffected.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move all objects (except those of color 6) to the right by a number of positions that could be determined by the object's size, color, or a combination of its characteristics. The exact rule for the amount of movement is not clear from the examples provided. Objects of color 6 do not change position, size, or color.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the input sequence.', 'For each object that is not of color 6, determine the number of positions it needs to be moved to the right. This number is not specified and should be inferred from the pattern or given as a rule.', 'Move the identified objects to the right by the determined number of positions. The background (0) should be filled in where the object was originally located.', 'Keep the objects of color 6 in their original positions.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not cause any overlap of objects, unless specified by the pattern.', 'Output the transformed sequence, maintaining the same dimension as the input.']

The transformation steps have been followed correctly: identifying objects, determining the move for non-color 6 objects, moving objects to the right without causing overlap, and keeping the dimension the same. However, the number of positions moved for Object_1 is not specified in the pattern, and based on the examples, it's unclear if moving by 3 positions is correct. There is no rule provided to infer the number of positions to move the object, so it's impossible to definitively rate the accuracy of the movement. However, the transformation seems to be in line with the general pattern provided.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were applied to the test input sequence, but there seems to be an inconsistency with the examples provided. From the examples, it appears that objects of colors other than 6 are moved by a certain number of positions to the right, but the exact rule for the number of positions is not clear. In the provided test case, Object_1, which is of color 7, was moved 3 positions to the right. However, this movement does not match the movement observed in the example cases. In Example_1, the object moved 2 positions; in Example_2, the object moved by 2 positions; and in Example_3, the object moved by 5 positions. There is no clear pattern in the number of positions moved based on the examples given. The object of color 6 remains unchanged, which is consistent with the transformation steps. However, without a clear rule for the number of positions to move the non-color 6 objects, we cannot accurately evaluate the correctness of the movement of Object_1. It is possible that the movement should have been different based on the unspecified rule. Therefore, the rating reflects the uncertainty in the transformation rule applied.",
