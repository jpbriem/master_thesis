You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation occurs when there are exactly two objects of the same color in the input
overall pattern: if there are two objects of the same color, they are merged into one object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, while the size is adjusted to cover the entire range between the two original objects


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects that meet the conditions.', 'Record the color of the identified objects.', 'Determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the second object.', 'Create a new object with the same color.', 'Set the start index of the new object to match the start index of the first object.', 'Set the end index of the new object to match the end index of the second object.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by subtracting the start index from the end index and adding 1.', 'Replace the two original objects with the new object in the output sequence.', 'Fill all positions between the start index and the end index of the new object with the color of the new object.']

overall pattern: For any objects of the same color that are not adjacent, merge them into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the last object, inclusive of the background pixels between them


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence', 'Check the color of each object', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color, proceed with the transformation', 'Find the first and the last object of the same color', 'Create a new object starting at the start_index of the first object', 'Extend the new object to the end_index of the last object of the same color', 'The size of the new object is the difference between the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the last object plus one', 'Replace the original objects and the background pixels between them with the new object', 'All other pixels remain unchanged']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 17],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

Value Outputs:
{
    "test_output_analysis": "The test output is incomplete and does not provide the necessary information such as the output dimension and description of the transformed objects. Without this information, it is impossible to determine if the transformation was applied correctly. The transformation steps indicate that objects of the same color that are not adjacent should be merged into a single object, which suggests that Object_1 and Object_2 in the input should have been merged into one object in the output, spanning from index 13 to index 15 with a size of 3. However, due to the lack of provided output data, this cannot be confirmed.",
