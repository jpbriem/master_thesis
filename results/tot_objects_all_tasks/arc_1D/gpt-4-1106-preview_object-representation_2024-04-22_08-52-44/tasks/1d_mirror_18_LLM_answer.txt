You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects:

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap positions if there is an object with color 9 present. The first object moves to the right, and the object with color 9 takes the position of the first object. The movement of the first object is such that it maintains a distance of two indices from the original position of the object with color 9.
overall pattern: For any input with two objects, where one of the objects is color 9, swap the positions of the objects. The object with color 9 goes to the initial position of the first object, and the first object moves to a new position maintaining a distance of two indices from the original position of the object with color 9. The sizes and colors of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects within the input sequence.', 'Check that one of the objects is of color 9 and has a size of 1. If this condition is not met, the pattern does not apply.', 'Swap the positions of the two objects, with the following specifics:', 'The object with color 9 moves to the starting index of the first object.', 'The first object moves to a new starting index that is exactly two places to the right of the original starting index of the object with color 9.', 'The ending index of the first object is adjusted to maintain its original size after the move.', 'The output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'All other pixels that are not part of the objects remain the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}

The object with color 9 goes to the initial position of the first object, and the first object moves to a new position maintaining a distance of two indices from the original position of the object with color 9. The sizes and colors of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects within the input sequence.', 'Check that one of the objects is of color 9 and has a size of 1. If this condition is not met, the pattern does not apply.', 'Swap the positions of the two objects, with the following specifics:', 'The object with color 9 moves to the starting index of the first object.', 'The first object moves to a new starting index that is exactly two places to the right of the original starting index of the object with color 9.', 'The ending index of the first object is adjusted to maintain its original size after the move.', 'The output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'All other pixels that are not part of the objects remain the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 20]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects swap positions if there is an object with color 9 present. The first object moves to the right, and the object with color 9 takes the position of the first object. The movement of the first object is such that it maintains a distance of two indices from the original position of the object with color 9.
overall pattern: For any input with two objects, where one of the objects is color 9, swap the positions of the objects. The object with color 9 goes to the initial position of the first object, and the first object moves to a new position maintaining a distance of two indices from the original position of the object with color 9. The sizes and colors of the objects do not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects within the input sequence.', 'Check that one of the objects is of color 9 and has a size of 1.

output:
test case output dimension: [1, 20]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

The object with color 9 should be moved to the starting index of the first object, which was correctly done. However, the first object was moved to the wrong starting index. According to the transformation steps, the first object should move to a new starting index that is exactly two places to the right of the original starting index of the object with color 9. The original starting index of the object with color 9 was 10, so the first object should have been moved to index 12. The ending index should also be adjusted accordingly to maintain its original size. In the test case output, the first object's starting index is given as 12, which is correct, but the ending index is given as 16, which maintains the correct size of 5.
