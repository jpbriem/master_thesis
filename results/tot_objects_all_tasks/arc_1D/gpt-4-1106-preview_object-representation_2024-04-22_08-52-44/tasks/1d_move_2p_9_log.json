This transformation applies to all objects irrespective of their individual characteristics.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', \"For each object, increment the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 2, effectively moving the object 2 positions to the right.\", 'Maintain the color and size of each object during the transformation.', 'Ensure that no overlaps of objects occur as a result of the shift.', 'Fill any gaps created by the move with the background color (0).']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 10}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 10}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 14}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects move regardless of their color, position, or size\noverall pattern: Each object moves 2 positions to the right while retaining its original color and size\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, shift the start_index 2 positions to the right.', 'For each object, shift the end_index 2 positions to the right.', 'Ensure that the size of the object remains unchanged.', 'Retain the original color of each object.', \"Fill the positions between the new start_index and end_index with the object's color.\", 'Retain the background color (0) for all other positions.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
