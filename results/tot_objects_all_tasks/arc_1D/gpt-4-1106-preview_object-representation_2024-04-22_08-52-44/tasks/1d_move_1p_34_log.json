The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size':
