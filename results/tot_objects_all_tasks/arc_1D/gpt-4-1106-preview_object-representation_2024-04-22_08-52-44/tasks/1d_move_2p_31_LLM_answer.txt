You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

conditions: The changes seem to be based on the position of the object's starting index. Objects are moved 2 positions to the right regardless of their color or size.
overall pattern: The general rule for transforming any input into its output is to move any object 2 positions to the right in the sequence. The type of object does not change, as the color and size remain the same. The transformation is not dependent on color or size but solely on the object's presence.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The test output shows the object starting at index 7 and ending at index 17, which is exactly 2 positions to the right of the original start and end indices. The size of the object remains the same at 11 pixels, fulfilling the requirement to maintain the original size after the move. The object has been correctly truncated to fit within the sequence dimension, without exceeding the given dimension of [1, 25]. The vacated positions by the moved object (indices 5 and 6) should be filled with the background color (0), and it is assumed that this step has been correctly applied as well. There is no evidence of incorrect transformation in the details provided.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 20}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 20}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 10}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 20}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 20}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved 2 positions to the right regardless of their color, position, or size
overall pattern: Move any object in the input 2 positions to the right to get its output


transformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, determine its color, start index, end index, and size', 'Move each object 2 positions to the right by changing its start and end index, increasing each by 2', 'Fill the vacated positions left by the moved object with the background color (0)', 'Ensure that the object does not exceed the sequence dimension after the move', "If the object's movement reaches or exceeds the sequence dimension, truncate the object to fit within the sequence", 'Maintain the original size of the object after the move', 'Output the transformed sequence with the moved objects in their new positions']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 11}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 11}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were correctly applied to the test input. Each step is analyzed as follows: 1) The object in the test input was correctly identified. 2) The color, start index, end index, and size of the object were accurately determined. 3) The object was moved 2 positions to the right, increasing its start and end index by 2. 4) The vacated positions (indices 5 and 6) were not explicitly mentioned, but should logically be filled with the background color (0). 5) The object did not exceed the sequence dimension after the move, which complies with the overall pattern and conditions. 6) Truncation was not necessary as the object still fit within the sequence dimension. 7) The original size of the object was maintained after the move. 8) The output sequence correctly reflects the moved object in its new position.", "value": 10}
