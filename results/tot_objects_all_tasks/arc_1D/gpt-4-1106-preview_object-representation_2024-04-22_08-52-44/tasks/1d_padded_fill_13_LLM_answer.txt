You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge if there is exactly one object of the same color separating them
overall pattern: starting from the first object, merge every second object of the same color with the one before it, so that the first object in the pair starts at its original start index and the last object in the pair ends at its original end index, filling all intermediate pixels with the same color



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Starting from the first object, locate the next object of the same color that is exactly one object away.', "For each pair of objects identified in step 2, merge the second object into the first by filling all background pixels between the 'start_index' of the first object and the 'end_index' of the second object with the object's color.", 'Remove the standalone object that was between the merged objects from the output sequence.', 'Repeat steps 2 to 4 for all objects of the same color until no eligible pairs for merging are left.', 'If there are any objects of the same color without a pair, they remain unchanged in the output sequence.']

Merge each pair into a single object in the output, with the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the second object of the pair. The size of the new object is the distance between the start_indices of the original objects plus one. The color remains unchanged

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge if there is exactly one object of the same color separating them
overall pattern: starting from the first object, merge every second object of the same color with the one before it, so that the first object in the pair starts at its original start index and the last object in the pair ends at its original end index, filling all intermediate pixels with the same color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'Starting from the first object, locate the next object of the same color that is exactly one object away.', "For each pair of objects identified in step 2, merge the second object into the first by filling all background pixels between the 'start_index' of the first object and the 'end_index' of the second object with the object's color.", 'Remove the standalone object that was between the merged objects from the output sequence.', 'Repeat steps 2 to 4 for all objects of the same color until no eligible pairs for merging are left.', 'If there are any objects of the same color without a pair, they remain unchanged in the output sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: two objects of the same color that have a certain distance between their start_indices are merged into one object in the output. The size of the new object is equal to the distance between the start_indices of the two original objects plus one
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects with the same color where the distance between their start_indices is either 6 or 16 pixels. Merge each pair into a single object in the output, with the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the second object of the pair. The size of the new object is the distance between the start_indices of the original objects plus one. The color remains unchanged


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all the objects. An object is defined by a sequence of non-zero pixels bordered by zeros or sequence ends.', 'Group objects by color to facilitate processing.', 'Within each color group, identify pairs of objects where the distance between their start_indices is either 6 or 16 pixels.', 'For each identified pair, create a new object with the following properties:', '  - The color of the new object is the same as the original objects.', '  - The start_index of the new object is the same as the start_index of the first object of the pair.', '  - The end_index of the new object is the same as the end_index of the second object of the pair.', '  - The size of the new object is the distance between the start_indices of the two original objects plus one.', 'Remove the original objects that were merged from the sequence.', 'Insert the new objects into the sequence at the positions indicated by their start_indices.', 'Fill the pixels between the start_index and end_index of the new objects with their color.', 'Fill all other pixels with 0 to represent the background.']

All intermediate pixels between the 'start_index' of the first object and the 'end_index' of the second object in each pair have been filled with the object's color, with the size reflecting the total number of pixels in the merged object. The size of each transformed object is 13, which is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples, where the size of the merged objects is equal to the distance between the 'start_index' of the first object and the 'end_index' of the second object plus one for the color pixel that was originally separating them. The test output has followed the overall pattern and transformation steps accurately.",

  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output seems to follow the overall pattern and transformation steps correctly. The original objects are all of the same color and are separated by exactly one object of the same color. According to the transformation steps, the first object remains unchanged and every second object merges with the previous one, filling all the background pixels with the same color. In the test case output, the first transformed object starts at index 4 and ends at index 16, which correctly merges the second object (originally at index 16) with the first one (originally at index 4). Similarly, the third and fourth objects merge, as well as the fifth and sixth objects. The size of the transformed objects is consistent with the pattern, as the start and end indices of each pair are correct, resulting in a size of 13 for each transformed object (including all intermediate pixels). No objects are left without a pair, and no additional objects are created or lost in the process.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
