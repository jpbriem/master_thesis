For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 10}, Object_6: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 10}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 10}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 10}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: the transformation pattern is based on object size, where only the object with the greatest size is kept while all others are removed\noverall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify the object with the greatest size and remove all other objects, keeping the largest object's color, position, and size the same\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Scan through the entire input sequence to identify all objects.', 'For each object, record its size along with its color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Compare the sizes of all identified objects to determine the object with the greatest size.', 'Remove all other objects from the sequence, leaving only the largest object.', 'The output sequence should maintain the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'Ensure the largest object retains its original color, start_index, end_index, and size in the output sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
