However, this violates the transformation step that states if the movement of an object causes it to exceed the boundaries of the sequence, the object must be truncated to fit within the sequence dimension. Since the sequence dimension is 30, the transformed object's end_index should be truncated to 29 instead of extending to 25. The size of the object should be adjusted accordingly to maintain the object within the dimension boundary, which would change the size to 26. The test output fails to truncate the object correctly to fit within the boundary.\",\n  \"value\": \"0\"\n}"
