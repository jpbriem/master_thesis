For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Objects with size 1 do not change\noverall pattern: For objects of size larger than 1, move the object to the right by the number of positions equal to its original starting index (minus 2 for starting indices greater than 5). For objects of size 1, make no change\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['For each object in the sequence, check the size of the object.', \"If the size is greater than 1, calculate the shift value. If the object's original starting index is greater than 5, subtract 2 from the starting index to determine the shift value.

Based on the transformation steps, since Object_1 has a size greater than 1, it should have been moved to the right by the number of positions equal to its original starting index, which is 0 in this case. Therefore, Object_1 should not have moved at all. However, the test output incorrectly suggests that Object_1 should move despite its starting index being 0.
