You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 27], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 9}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects move three positions to the right. There are no conditions that alter the transformation based on color, position, or size across the examples.
overall pattern: For any input, move all objects exactly 3 positions to the right without changing their color or size.



transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence based on adjacent pixels of the same color.', "For each identified object, increase the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 3 positions to shift the object to the right.", "Maintain the object's color and size during the transformation.", 'If the end of the object after shifting to the right exceeds the dimension of the input sequence, the object is truncated to fit within the bounds of the sequence.', 'Fill the positions previously occupied by the object with the background color, represented by 0.', 'Retain the background color (0) in all positions not occupied by an object.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output adheres to the transformation steps provided. The original object is described as having a color of 7, starting at index 5 and ending at index 11, with a size of 7. Following the transformation rules, the start and end indices of this object should each be increased by 3. In the test output, the object's start index is 8 and the end index is 14, which is consistent with the transformation pattern that requires shifting the object 3 positions to the right. The size remains unchanged at 7, and the color remains at 7, which also follows the prescribed steps. Additionally, the dimension of the sequence has not changed and remains [1, 27]. No part of the object has exceeded the bounds of the sequence, so truncation is not an issue in this case. Therefore, the transformation appears to have been applied correctly.", "value": 10}

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has been analyzed based on the provided transformation steps. The input object is of color 7, starting at index 5 and ending at index 11, with a size of 7. According to the transformation pattern, the object should move three positions to the right. Thus, the 'start_index' should increase from 5 to 8, and the 'end_index' should increase from 11 to 14, which is exactly what is shown in the test output. The size remains unchanged at 7, which is correct. The transformation steps do not indicate any special conditions that would alter the transformation, and the end_index of 14 does not exceed the input dimension limit (27), so truncation is not necessary. The color is maintained as 7, which is also in line with the transformation rules. Therefore, the test output appears to be a correct transformation of the test input according to the specified pattern and steps.",
