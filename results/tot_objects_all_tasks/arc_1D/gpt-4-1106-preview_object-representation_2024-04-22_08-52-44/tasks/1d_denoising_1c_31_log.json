For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 12}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 12}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects smaller than the largest object in the sequence are removed, regardless of their color, positions, or other attributes\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, remove all objects except for the largest one. The largest object's color, position, and size do not change, and the background remains the same\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the largest object in the sequence by comparing the size of each object', 'Remove all objects from the sequence that are smaller than the largest object', 'Retain the largest object in its original position with its original color and size', 'Fill the gaps left by removed objects with the background color (0)']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.
