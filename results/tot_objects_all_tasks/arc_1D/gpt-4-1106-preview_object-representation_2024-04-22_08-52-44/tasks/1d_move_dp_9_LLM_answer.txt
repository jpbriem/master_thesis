You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes are determined by the size of the objects. Larger objects are moved to the right, while smaller objects remain in their initial positions.
overall pattern: Large objects (size > 1) are moved to a new position to the right, with the distance moved possibly related to their initial start_index or a fixed value. Small objects (size = 1) do not change position, color, or size.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, determine its size.', "If an object's size is greater than 1, calculate the new start and end indices for this object to be moved to the right.", "The distance to move the object may be a fixed value or determined by the object's initial start_index. Use the examples to deduce the exact rule for the distance of movement.", "If an object's size is 1, do not move it; keep its position, color, and size unchanged.", 'Output the transformed sequence with objects in their new positions.']

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes are determined by the size of the objects. Larger objects are moved to the right, while smaller objects remain in their initial positions.
overall pattern: Large objects (size > 1) are moved to a new position to the right, with the distance moved possibly related to their initial start_index or a fixed value. Small objects (size = 1) do not change position, color, or size.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, determine its size.', "If an object's size is greater than 1, calculate the new start and end indices for this object to be moved to the right.", "The distance to move the object may be a fixed value or determined by the object's initial start_index. Use the examples to deduce the exact rule for the distance of movement.", "If an object's size is 1, do not move it; keep its position, color, and size unchanged.", 'Output the transformed sequence with objects in their new positions.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output appears to follow the overall pattern and transformation steps correctly for Object_2, which has a size of 1 and therefore remains unchanged. However, there seems to be an inconsistency with Object_1. According to the examples provided, objects larger than size 1 are moved to the right, with the distance moved relating to their initial start_index or a fixed value. Looking at the examples, the movement distance for large objects appears to be proportional to the start_index, with larger start_indices resulting in larger movements. In Example_1, the object moves 4 places to the right (from 9 to 13). In Example_2, the object moves 2 places to the right (from 7 to 9). In Example_3, the object moves 8 places to the right (from 3 to 11). However, in the test case, Object_1 with a start_index of 5 moves 5 places to the right (from 5 to 10), which doesn't seem consistent with the examples provided, as the movement should likely be either 2 places (consistent with Example_2) or 4 places (averaging the movement seen in Example_1 and Example_3). This inconsistency suggests that the rule for determining the exact movement distance has not been correctly applied or deduced from the examples.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output shows the transformation of a large object (size > 1) and a small object (size = 1). According to the overall pattern, the large object should be moved to the right, while the small object should remain unchanged. Given the examples, we can deduce that the large objects are consistently moved to the right by 4 positions (Example_1: from 9 to 13, Example_2: from 7 to 9, Example_3: from 3 to 11). Applying this rule to the test case, Object_1 with the original start_index of 5 should be moved to start_index 9 (5+4) and end_index 22 (18+4). However, the test output shows Object_1 moved to start_index 10 and end_index 23, which is a shift of 5 positions to the right instead of 4. Additionally, Object_1's move should not overlap with Object_2 which remains in its original position at index 23. The test output incorrectly shows overlap, with Object_1's end_index being the same as Object_2's start_index. Therefore, the transformation was not applied correctly according to the deduced rule and overall pattern.",
