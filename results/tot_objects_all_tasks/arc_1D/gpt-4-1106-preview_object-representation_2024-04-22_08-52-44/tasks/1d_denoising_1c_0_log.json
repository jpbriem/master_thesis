In the input, there are single-pixel objects at indices 14, 17, and 21, which have been correctly removed in the output. The largest object, which spans from index 0 to 11 and has a size of 12, is correctly retained in the output. All transformation steps have been properly applied: the objects were scanned and identified, grouped by color, the largest object was identified and retained, single-pixel objects were removed, and the final sequence was output with the retained objects in their original positions with the rest filled with the background color.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
