The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The first object in the sequence expands in size to fill the space until the start of the next object. The subsequent objects, if any, remain unchanged.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the first object in the sequence. Expand its size to occupy all available space up to the start of the next object while maintaining its original color and position. Leave all subsequent objects unchanged in color, position, and size.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the input sequence', 'Determine the starting index of the next object', 'Expand the size of the first object to occupy all available space up to the start of the next object, keeping its original color', 'Retain all subsequent objects with their original attributes']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
