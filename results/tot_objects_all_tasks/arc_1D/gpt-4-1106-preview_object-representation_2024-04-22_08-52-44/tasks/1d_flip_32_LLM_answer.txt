You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes are consistent across all examples and are determined by the position of the pixels within their objects. Specifically, the swap occurs between the first and last pixels of the object, regardless of the object's color or size.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the general rule is to swap the first and last pixel colors of each object. This transformation is applied to each object within the sequence individually.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they have different colored pixels at their beginning and end. The pattern seems to consistently apply to these two position-based elements of an object.
overall pattern: For any input, the transformation rule is to swap the colors of the first and last pixels of each object. This applies regardless of the object's size, color, or position in the sequence.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'coordinates': [[0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23]], 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3], 'coordinates': [[0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23]], 'size': 10}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13]], 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13]], 'size': 14}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], 'coordinates': [[0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23]], 'size': 12}
output: Dimension: [1, 31], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23]], 'size': 12}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they have different colored pixels at their beginning and end. The pattern seems to consistently apply to these two position-based elements of an object.
overall pattern: For any input, the transformation rule is to swap the colors of the first and last pixels of each object. This applies regardless of the object's size, color, or position in the sequence.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object, check if the color of the first pixel is different from the color of the last pixel.', 'If the first and last pixel colors are different, swap their colors.', 'Retain the position of all other pixels within the object.', 'Output the modified sequence with the swapped colors while maintaining the original object size and coordinates.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 31],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], 'coordinates': [[0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23], [0, 24]], 'size': 15}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

conditions: The changes are consistent across all examples and are determined by the position of the pixels within their objects. Specifically, the swap occurs between the first and last pixels of the object, regardless of the object's color or size.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, the general rule is to swap the first and last pixel colors of each object. This transformation is applied to each object within the sequence individually.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object with size greater than 1:', '  - Swap the color value of the first pixel with the color value of the last pixel.', '  - Keep the color values of all other pixels within the object unchanged.', 'If an object has a size of 1, do not apply any transformation to it.', 'Maintain the position of all objects within the sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 31],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], 'coordinates': [[0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23], [0, 24]], 'size': 15}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 31]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23], [0, 24]], 'size': 15}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the overall pattern and adheres to the transformation steps. The input sequence has one object with a size of 15, and the output sequence shows that the colors of the first and last pixel within the object have been swapped, while the colors of the other pixels remain the same. The coordinates of the object in both the input and the output have not changed, which complies with the rule to maintain the position of all objects within the sequence. Given that the test output correctly applies the transformation rules, it receives a high rating.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output appears to follow the overall pattern and transformation steps correctly. The input object has a size greater than 1, so the transformation rule to swap the first and last pixel colors of the object applies. In the input, the first color is 6 and the last color is 7. After transformation, the first color in the object becomes 7 and the last color becomes 6, which is consistent with the transformation steps provided. All other pixels within the object remain unchanged, and the position of the object in the sequence is maintained. There are no other objects in the input sequence, so no other transformations are needed. Based on this analysis, the transformation was applied correctly.", "value": 10}
