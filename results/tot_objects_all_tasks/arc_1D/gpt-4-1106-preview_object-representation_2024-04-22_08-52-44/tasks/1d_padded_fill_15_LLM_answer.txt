You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are merged if the difference between the start index of one and the start index of the next is a consistent number, forming a new object that spans from the start index of the first to the end index of the last
overall pattern: Identify groups of objects where the difference between the start indices is consistent. Merge these objects into a larger object that retains the original color, starts at the start index of the first object in the group, and ends at the last index that would be reached if the objects were adjacent, resulting in a size that equals the distance between the start indices plus the size of one original object

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Merge these objects into a larger object that retains the original color, starts at the start index of the first object in the group, and ends at the last index that would be reached if the objects were adjacent, resulting in a size that equals the distance between the start indices plus the size of one original object



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the sequence.', 'Check if the objects are of the same color and if the difference in start indices between consecutive objects is consistent.', "If the conditions are met, merge the objects into a new object.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 44, 'end_index': 44, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 48, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 44, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 37, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 47, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 37, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 47, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 11}

overall pattern:
conditions: Pairs of objects merge if they are 4 or 10 indices apart from each other, depending on the input sequence
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects that are either 4 or 10 indices apart and merge them into a single object that spans from the start index of the first to the end index of the second object, increasing their size accordingly. This rule applies regardless of the color of the objects



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and locate all objects.', 'For each object, calculate the distance to the next object.', 'If the distance to the next object is exactly 4 or 10 indices, consider the objects a pair eligible for merging.', 'Merge each identified pair by creating a new object with the following properties:', '- The color of the new object is the same as the original objects.', '- The start_index of the new object is the same as the start_index of the first object in the pair.', '- The end_index of the new object is the same as the end_index of the second object in the pair.', '- The size of the new object is the sum of the original sizes plus the distance between the objects.', 'Remove the original objects that have been merged from the sequence.', 'Repeat the process until all eligible pairs have been merged.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the merged objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Merge these objects into a larger object that retains the original color, starts at the start index of the first object in the group, and ends at the last index that would be reached if the objects were adjacent, resulting in a size that equals the distance between the start indices plus the size of one original object

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Pairs of objects merge if they are 4 or 10 indices apart from each other, depending on the input sequence
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects that are either 4 or 10 indices apart and merge them into a single object that spans from the start index of the first to the end index of the second object, increasing their size accordingly. This rule applies regardless of the color of the objects


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and locate all objects.', 'For each object, calculate the distance to the next object.', 'If the distance to the next object is exactly 4 or 10 indices, consider the objects a pair eligible for merging.', 'Merge each identified pair by creating a new object with the following properties:', '- The color of the new object is the same as the original objects.', '- The start_index of the new object is the same as the start_index of the first object in the pair.', '- The end_index of the new object is the same as the end_index of the second object in the pair.', '- The size of the new object is the sum of the original sizes plus the distance between the objects.', 'Remove the original objects that have been merged from the sequence.', 'Repeat the process until all eligible pairs have been merged.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the merged objects.']

This rule applies regardless of the color of the objects


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and locate all objects.', 'For each object, calculate the distance to the next object.', 'If the distance to the next object is exactly 4 or 10 indices, consider the objects a pair eligible for merging.', 'Merge each identified pair by creating a new object with the following properties:', '- The color of the new object is the same as the original objects.', '- The start_index of the new object is the same as the start_index of the first object in the pair.', '- The end_index of the new object is the same as the end_index of the second object in the pair.', '- The size of the new object is the sum of the original sizes plus the distance between the objects.', 'Remove the original objects that have been merged from the sequence.', 'Repeat the process until all eligible pairs have been merged.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the merged objects.']
