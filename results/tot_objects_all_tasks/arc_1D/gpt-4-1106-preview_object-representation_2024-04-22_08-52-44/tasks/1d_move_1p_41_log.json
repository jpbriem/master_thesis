The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change?

The object, which has a color of 2 and originally starts from index 0 and ends at index 7, has been shifted one index to the right. The object now starts at index 1 and ends at index 8, which is consistent with the transformation rule of moving each object one index to the right. The size of the object remains unchanged at 8 pixels. The dimension of the output sequence has been correctly extended from [1, 14] to [1, 15] to accommodate the shift of the object towards the right boundary. The space originally occupied by the leftmost pixel of the object (at index 0) has been filled with a background pixel (color 0), as required by the transformation steps.
