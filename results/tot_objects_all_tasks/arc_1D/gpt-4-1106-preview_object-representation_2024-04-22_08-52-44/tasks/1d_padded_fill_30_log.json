The transformation steps are: 1. Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence. 2. For each pair of adjacent objects of the same color: Change the size of the first object to span from its start_index to the start_index of the next object of the same color, Modify the end_index of the first object to be one less than the start_index of the next object, Remove the next object from the sequence. 3. Leave the background pixels between the expanded objects and at the boundaries of the sequence unchanged. Applying these steps to the test input, we get: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 34, 'end_index': 42, 'size': 9}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 63, 'end_index': 71, 'size': 9}.
