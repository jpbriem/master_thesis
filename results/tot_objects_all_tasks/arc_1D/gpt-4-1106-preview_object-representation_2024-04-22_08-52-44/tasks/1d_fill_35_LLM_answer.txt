You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 10}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 26}

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation applies to pairs of objects with the same color
overall pattern: when there are two objects with the same color, the first object expands its size to fill the space between itself and the second object, inclusively, effectively combining the two objects into one



transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the sequence.', 'Identify the second object in the sequence.', 'Check that both objects have the same color; if not, the rule does not apply.', "Expand the first object's size by changing the values of the pixels from the first object's end_index+1 to the second object's start_index-1 to the color of the objects.", 'The end_index of the first object is updated to the start_index of the second object.', "The size of the first object is updated to the new size after expansion, which is the distance from the first object's start_index to the second object's start_index plus one for the second object's pixel.", 'Remove the second object from the sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

The end_index of the first object should be updated to 20, and the size should be updated to 17 (the distance from index 4 to index 20 inclusive). The second object is then removed from the sequence.

output: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 26}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when they are of the same color and are not adjacent to each other
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, if there are multiple objects of the same color that do not have any pixels between them, merge them into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the last object, filling all intermediate indices with that color


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence', 'Check if there are at least two objects with the same color', 'If objects of the same color are found, determine the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the last object', 'Replace all pixels from the start_index to the end_index with the identified color, effectively merging the objects', "All intermediate indices between the start_index and the end_index that were originally background pixels (color 0) are transformed to the object's color", 'The size of the new object is the difference between the end_index and the start_index plus one', 'Output the transformed sequence with the new merged object']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 30]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 17}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output seems to have followed the transformation pattern correctly. The input had two objects of the same color (6) that were not adjacent. Following the pattern, these objects were merged into a single object spanning from the start index of the first object (4) to the end index of the last object (20). The size of the new object is calculated as the difference between the end index and the start index plus one, which is (20 - 4) + 1 = 17, matching the size provided in the test output. All steps of the transformation instructions appear to have been correctly applied.", "value": 10}

{"test_output_analysis": "The test output seems to have correctly applied the transformation steps. The input sequence had two separate objects of the same color (color 6) that were not adjacent to each other. According to the transformation steps, these objects should be merged into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the last object, filling all intermediate indices with that color, which is what is reflected in the test output. The new object's size is correctly calculated as the difference between the end_index (20) and the start_index (4) plus one, resulting in a size of 17. All steps appear to have been followed correctly.", "value": 10}
