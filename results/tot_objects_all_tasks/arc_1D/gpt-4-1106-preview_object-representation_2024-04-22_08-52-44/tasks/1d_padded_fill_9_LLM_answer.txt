You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 51, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 14}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 14}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 32, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 42, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 49, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 8}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge when they are at certain intervals apart, which is consistent across examples
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects that are of the same color and separated by a consistent number of indices (13, 5, 7), then merge each pair into a single object that spans from the starting index of the first to the starting index of the second, inclusive



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'Check if all identified objects have the same color', 'Determine the consistent interval separating the objects in the input sequence', 'Pair up adjacent objects according to the determined interval', 'For each pair of objects, merge them into a new object spanning from the start index of the first object to the start index of the second, inclusive', 'Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the new merged objects', 'Ensure all non-object pixels (0s) remain unchanged', 'Output the transformed sequence as the new output sequence']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 14}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 14}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 32, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 42, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 49, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 8}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 8}

overall pattern:
conditions: all objects have the same color and are separated by background pixels
overall pattern: if consecutive objects share the same color, their size changes to fill the space from the start_index of the first object to the start_index of the following object, effectively eliminating the background between them and reducing the number of objects


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the same color that are separated only by background pixels.', "For every pair of consecutive objects, extend the first object's size to cover the range from its own start_index up to the start_index of the following object.", 'Remove any background pixels between the paired objects, effectively merging them into a single object.', 'Repeat this process for all pairs of consecutive objects of the same color within the input sequence.', 'The end_index of each newly sized object will be one less than the start_index of the following object, if there is one; otherwise, it will be the start_index of the last object in the pair.', 'The size of each newly sized object will be the difference between its new end_index and its start_index plus one.', 'The color of the newly sized objects remains the same as the original objects.', 'The number of objects in the output sequence will be equal to the number of initial single-pixel objects divided by the number of objects in each pair, assuming there are pairs to merge.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge when they are at certain intervals apart, which is consistent across examples
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects that are of the same color and separated by a consistent number of indices (13, 5, 7), then merge each pair into a single object that spans from the starting index of the first to the starting index of the second, inclusive


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'Check if all identified objects have the same color', 'Determine the consistent interval separating the objects in the input sequence', 'Pair up adjacent objects according to the determined interval', 'For each pair of objects, merge them into a new object spanning from the start index of the first object to the start index of the second, inclusive', 'Replace the original objects in the input sequence with the new merged objects', 'Ensure all non-object pixels (0s) remain unchanged', 'Output the transformed sequence as the new output sequence']

However, in the test input, we have two different intervals (4 and 14), which are not consistent with the intervals in the examples. Based on the given pattern, we can't merge any objects because none of the pairs of objects are separated by the intervals specified in the examples. If we were to follow the examples strictly, the output should be identical to the input, with no merging occurring. Since the transformation steps and the overall pattern do not specify how to handle intervals that differ from those in the examples, the test output should reflect the input without any transformation.",
