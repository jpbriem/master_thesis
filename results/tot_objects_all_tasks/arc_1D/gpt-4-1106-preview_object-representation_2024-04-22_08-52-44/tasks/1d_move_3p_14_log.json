For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 18}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 17}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 17}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: All objects move 3 places to the right regardless of their color or size\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move each object exactly 3 places to the right within the given dimension\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the object(s) in the input sequence', 'For each object, calculate the new start index by adding 3 to the original start index', 'Calculate the new end index for each object by adding 3 to the original end index', 'Ensure that the object does not exceed the bounds of the dimension; if it does, adjust the size or wrap around as per additional unstated rules', 'Recolor the original positions of the object to the background color (0)', \"Color the new positions from the new start to the new end index with the object's color\", 'Output the transformed sequence with the object(s) moved to their new positions']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
