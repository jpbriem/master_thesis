For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects of size 1 change: they increase in size to 3 and move left by 1 index, while objects larger than size 1 remain the same\noverall pattern: For objects of size 1, increase size to 3 and move the start index left by 1 index; for objects of size greater than 1, leave them unchanged\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the sequence.', 'For each object, check the size attribute.', 'If the size of the object is 1:', '  - Increase the size of the object to 3.', '  - Move the start_index of the object left by 1 index.', '  - Adjust the end_index to reflect the new size by adding 2 to the original start_index.', 'If the size of the object is greater than 1:', '  - Leave the object unchanged.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.
