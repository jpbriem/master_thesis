The input sequence has Object_1 with color 4 starting at index 4 and ending at index 17 with a size of 14. According to the transformation rules, this object should expand to the right until it is one pixel away from the next object. The next object, Object_2, is at index 21 and is of size 1, which should not change. Therefore, Object_1 should expand only up to index 20 since index 21 is occupied by Object_2. However, the output provided incorrectly expands Object_1 to end at index 20. The size of Object_1 after the correct transformation should be 17, not 16 as indicated in the output. Object_2 is correctly left unchanged with a size of 1.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test input has two objects. According to the transformation pattern, the first object should expand to the right until it is one pixel away from the next object or the end of the sequence. In the test input, Object_1 has a size greater than 1 and should expand. Given the space in the sequence, Object_1 should expand from index 17 to index 20, which is correct as seen in the output. Object_2 is of size 1 and should remain unchanged, which is also correct as seen in the output. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
