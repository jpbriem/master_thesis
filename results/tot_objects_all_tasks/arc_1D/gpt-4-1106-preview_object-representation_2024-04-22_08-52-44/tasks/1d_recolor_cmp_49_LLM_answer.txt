You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size. Specifically, objects of size 4 or greater have their color changed from 2 to 7.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, change the color of any object sized 4 or more from color 2 to color 7. Leave all other objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.', '2. For each identified object, check if the size is 4 or greater.', "3. If an object's size is 4 or greater and its color is 2, change the object's color to 7.", '4. Leave all other objects unchanged.', '5. Construct the output sequence by placing the transformed and untransformed objects back into their original positions.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their size. Specifically, objects of size 4 or greater have their color changed from 2 to 7.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, change the color of any object sized 4 or more from color 2 to color 7. Leave all other objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.', '2. For each identified object, check if the size is 4 or greater.', "3. If an object's size is 4 or greater and its color is 2, change the object's color to 7.", '4. Leave all other objects unchanged.', '5. Construct the output sequence by placing the transformed and untransformed objects back into their original positions.']

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 5}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size greater than 3 change color
overall pattern: Objects with size greater than 3 change color to 7, all other objects remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Iterate through each object in the input sequence', 'Check the size of the current object', "If the object size is greater than 3, change the object's color to 7", "Keep all other objects' colors unchanged", 'Reconstruct the output sequence with the transformed objects']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 24],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 24]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}
