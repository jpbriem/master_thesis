The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

The distance of the shift is equal to half their size rounded down. Objects with a size of 1 do not change position\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, shift each object larger than size 1 to the right by a distance equal to half its size rounded down. Objects with a size of 1 remain unchanged in position, color, and size\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, check if the size is greater than 1', 'If the size is greater than 1, calculate the shift distance as half the size of the object rounded down', 'Shift the object to the right by the calculated distance', 'For objects with a size of 1, do not apply any transformation', 'Maintain the color and size of all objects', 'Place the transformed objects back into the sequence while preserving the total dimension']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 13],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 13]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation was not applied correctly to the test input. Object_1, which has a size greater than 1, should be shifted to the right by a distance equal to half its size rounded down. The size of Object_1 is 9, so the shift distance should be 9 / 2 = 4.5, rounded down to 4. The starting index of Object_1 in the input is 0, so after the shift, it should start at index 4. However, the end_index of Object_1 after shifting should be 4 + 9 - 1 = 12, since the object size is 9, and we need to subtract 1 to get the correct end_index (0-based indexing). Object_2 has a size of 1 and therefore should not change its position. The test output shows Object_2 correctly unchanged, but Object_1 is incorrectly shifted. The rightmost pixel of Object_1 should be at index 12, not beyond the dimension limit of 13.\",\n  \"value\": 5\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output seems to have been incorrectly transformed from the test input. According to the overall pattern, objects larger than size 1 should be shifted to the right by a distance equal to half their size rounded down. For Object_1, with the size of 9, the shift distance should be 9/2 = 4.5, which when rounded down is 4. This means the start index should have been shifted from 0 to 4, and the end index from 8 to 12, which matches the transformed Object_1 in the output. However, Object_2, with a size of 1, should not change position, which is correctly shown in the output as it remains unchanged with a start and end index of 11. The error in the analysis lies in the fact that the transformation overflows the defined dimension of [1, 13]. When Object_1 is shifted, its end index at 12 exceeds the maximum index of 12 (since indexing is zero-based, the last index in a sequence of 13 is 12). Therefore, the object should be truncated to fit within the dimensions, but this is not reflected in the test output.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}"
