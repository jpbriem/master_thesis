The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17]], 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4], 'coordinates': [[0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17]], 'size': 7}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 9}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 9}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 9}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4], 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 9}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformations occur based on the first and last pixels of any given object, regardless of its size and position in the sequence.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, swap the colors of the first and last pixels of each object. The size and position of the object do not affect this rule. No other pixels are altered.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the first and last pixel of each object in the sequence', 'Swap the colors of the first and last pixel of each object', 'Keep all other pixels unchanged']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
