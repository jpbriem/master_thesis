You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 18}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change by shifting their position to the right. The shift is consistent across examples.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, increment the start_index and end_index of each object by 3 to obtain the output sequence. The objects retain their color and size during this transformation.



transformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence and their properties: color, start_index, end_index, and size.', 'For each object, increment the start_index and end_index by 3 to shift the object to the right.', 'Maintain the size and color of each object during the shift.', "Fill the new positions between the old end_index and the new end_index with the object's color.", 'Replace the original positions of the object before the shift with the background color (0), unless they overlap with a new position of the same or another object.', 'Ensure that the output sequence has the same dimension as the input sequence, with any positions not occupied by shifted objects filled with the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 18}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects change only in their positions, shifting right by 3 units. This transformation is consistent regardless of the object's color, size, or initial position
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, shift each object's position to the right by 3 units without changing the color or size of the object


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', "For each identified object, increment the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 3.", 'Maintain the color and size of each object.', 'Place the transformed object into the output sequence at the new indices.', "Fill any gaps before the new 'start_index' of the object with the background color (0)."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 24],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 11}
output:
test case output dimension: state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
