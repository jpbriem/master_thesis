The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

The first object's start_index and end_index moved from 2 and 10 to 4 and 12, respectively, while preserving its size of 9 and color of 2. The second object remained unchanged, with its start_index and end_index at 13, size of 1, and color of 1. The dimension of the output sequence is the same as the input sequence, which is [1, 15], complying with the transformation steps. There is no indication that the spaces left by the movement of the first object have not been filled with the background color, so it can be assumed that this step has been correctly applied as well.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation steps appear to have been followed correctly for the given test case. The first object, which started from index 2 and ended at index 10, has been moved by 2 positions to the right, now starting at index 4 and ending at index 12, while preserving its size of 9 and its color of 2. The second object remained unchanged, with the same color of 1, and occupying the same start and end positions of 13. The output dimension is the same as the input dimension, both being [1, 15].
