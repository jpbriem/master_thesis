You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects are paired and expanded if they are of the same color, the pattern is consistent across different colors, the distance between pairs determines the size of the new object
overall pattern: identify objects of the same color, pair them sequentially, calculate the distance between the start index of the second object and the end index of the first object in each pair, expand the first object to match the end index of the second object, the size is the original size of the first object plus the distance to the second object



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence from left to right and identify all objects.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each group, sort objects by their starting index.', 'Iterate over the sorted objects in pairs. For each pair (first_object, second_object):', '  - Calculate the distance between the ending index of the first_object and the starting index of the second_object.', '  - Set the end_index of the first_object to the end_index of the second_object to create a new expanded object.', '  - Calculate the new size of the expanded object by adding the distance calculated in the previous step to the size of the first_object.', '  - Remove the second_object from the output sequence, as it is now part of the expanded first_object.', 'Repeat the process for each pair of objects in the group.', 'Ensure that objects which are not paired (i.e., do not have a subsequent object of the same color to pair with) are not modified.', 'Construct the output sequence by placing the expanded objects back into their original positions, filling the gaps with zeros (background color).']

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change if they are of the same color and have a consistent number of background pixels separating pairs of objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a consistent number of background pixels separating them. Merge each pair into a single object, where the start_index is that of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is that of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.



transformation steps: ['Identify all pairs of objects that meet the conditions: same color and a consistent number of background pixels between them.', 'For each identified pair, merge the two objects into a single object by setting the start_index of the new object to the start_index of the first object and the end_index to the end_index of the second object in the pair.', 'The size of the merged object is calculated as the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.', 'Repeat the merge process for all pairs that meet the conditions.', 'Remove the original objects that were merged from the sequence, leaving only the newly formed objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_2:

overall pattern:
conditions: objects are paired and expanded if they are of the same color, the pattern is consistent across different colors, the distance between pairs determines the size of the new object
overall pattern: identify objects of the same color, pair them sequentially, calculate the distance between the start index of the second object and the end index of the first object in each pair, expand the first object to match the end index of the second object, the size is the original size of the first object plus the distance to the second object


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence from left to right and identify all objects.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each group, sort objects by their starting index.', 'Iterate over the sorted objects in pairs.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a consistent number of background pixels separating them. Merge each pair into a single object, where the start_index is that of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is that of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of both objects plus the number of background pixels that were between them.
