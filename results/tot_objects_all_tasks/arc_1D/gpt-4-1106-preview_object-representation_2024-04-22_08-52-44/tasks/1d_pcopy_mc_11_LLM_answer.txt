You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 change. They are scaled to size 3 and shifted one index to the left. Objects that already have a size of 3 or more remain unchanged.
overall pattern: If an object has a size of 1, increase its size to 3, retain its color, and shift its position one index to the left. If an object has a size of 3 or more, it remains unchanged in size, color, and position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change if their size is equal to 1, regardless of their color or position
overall pattern: if an object has a size of 1, it changes by increasing its size to 3, expanding to the left and right by adding pixels of the same color, resulting in a new size of 3; objects of size greater than 1 remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Iterate over each object in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the size is equal to 1.', "If an object's size is 1, expand the object by adding one pixel of the same color to its left and one pixel of the same color to its right.", "As a result, the object's size increases to 3, and its start and end indices are adjusted accordingly (start_index is decremented by 1, and end_index is incremented by 1).", "If an object's size is greater than 1, do not apply any transformation to the object.", 'Repeat the process for all objects in the sequence.', 'Output the transformed sequence where all objects of size 1 have been expanded to size 3, and all other objects remain unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 change. They are scaled to size 3 and shifted one index to the left. Objects that already have a size of 3 or more remain unchanged.
overall pattern: If an object has a size of 1, increase its size to 3, retain its color, and shift its position one index to the left. If an object has a size of 3 or more, it remains unchanged in size, color, and position.


transformation steps: ['For objects with size 1, retain the color, increase the size to 3, and shift the start and end index one position to the left (decrement both the start_index and end_index by 1).', 'For objects with size 3 or more, no changes are made to size, color, or position.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

#############################
Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output closely follows the transformation steps outlined for objects of size 1 and objects of size 3 or more. Object_1, which has a size of 3, remains unchanged in the output, which is correct according to the transformation rules. Object_2 and Object_3, each initially of size 1, are correctly expanded to size 3 and shifted one index to the left. The colors are preserved, and the start and end indices are correctly decremented by one for both objects, leading to the correct new positions and sizes in the output sequence. The test output correctly transforms the test input in accordance with the given transformation pattern and steps.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The given test output correctly follows the transformation steps specified. Object_1, which has a size greater than 1, remains unchanged as per the rules. Object_2 and Object_3, which are both of size 1 in the input, are correctly scaled to size 3 and shifted left by one index in the output. The color of each object is retained, and the size and position adjustments are consistent with the overall pattern and the detailed transformation steps. Therefore, the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
