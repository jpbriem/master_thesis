You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 9}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 9}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 25}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 25}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on a fixed rule that applies consistently across all examples. The rule is independent of the object's color, size, or original position.
overall pattern: For any input, to transform it into its output, move each object exactly 2 indices to the right within the same dimension without altering the object's color or size.



transformation steps: ['Identify the object or objects within the input sequence', 'For each object, determine its current start and end indices', 'Move each object 2 indices to the right by updating the start and end indices, i.e., add 2 to both the current start and end indices', "Ensure that the object's color and size remain unchanged during the move", "If the move would result in the object's end index exceeding the dimension's length, adjust the transformation according to the constraints of the dimension (e.g., wraparound, truncation, etc.), if such behavior is specified", 'Fill in the positions previously occupied by the object with the background color (0)', "Fill in the new positions of the object with the object's color, ensuring the object size is consistent with the original", 'Output the transformed sequence with the object in its new position']

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 25}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 25}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on a fixed rule that applies consistently across all examples. The rule is independent of the object's color, size, or original position.
overall pattern: For any input, to transform it into its output, move each object exactly 2 indices to the right within the same dimension without altering the object's color or size.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object or objects within the input sequence', 'For each object, determine its current start and end indices', 'Move each object 2 indices to the right by updating the start and end indices, i.e., add 2 to both the current start and end indices', "Ensure that the object's color and size remain unchanged during the move", "If the move would result in the object's end index exceeding the dimension's length, adjust the transformation according to the constraints of the dimension (e.g., wraparound, truncation, etc.), if such behavior is specified", 'Fill in the positions previously occupied by the object with the background color (0)', "Fill in the new positions of the object with the object's color, ensuring the object size is consistent with the original", 'Output the transformed sequence with the object in its new position']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 23}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 29]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 23}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test case input sequence has an object of color 2, starting at index 1 and ending at index 23, with a size of 23. According to the transformation steps, each object should be moved exactly 2 indices to the right. After transformation, the object should start at index 3 and end at index 25, maintaining its color and size. The test output shows the object starting at index 3 and ending at index 25 with the same color, which matches the expected result based on the pattern and transformation steps. The object has been moved 2 indices to the right without altering its color or size, and it remains within the dimension's length without the need for adjustments such as wraparound or truncation. Therefore, the transformation seems to have been applied correctly.", "value": 10}

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output follows the transformation steps correctly. The input object starts at index 1 and ends at index 23 with a size of 23 and color 2. According to the transformation steps, this object should move 2 indices to the right. The output object correctly starts at index 3 and ends at index 25, maintaining the size of 23 and color 2. The movement does not cause the object's end index to exceed the dimension's length, thus no additional adjustments are required. The color and size of the object remain unchanged, and the transformation adheres to the specified overall pattern.",
