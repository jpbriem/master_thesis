You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: When there are multiple objects of the same color, smaller objects change to match the size of the largest object and move one position to the left.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the largest object of each color. Other objects of the same color will grow in size to match the largest object, and shift one position to the left. Objects that are already the largest size or are alone of their color will remain unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation affects objects with a size of 1. These objects are shifted left by one index and their size is increased to 3.
overall pattern: Objects with a size greater than 1 remain unchanged. Objects with a size of 1 are transformed by shifting their position to the left by one index and expanding their size to 3 by adding one pixel of the same color to both the left and right of the original position


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with a size of 1.', 'For each identified object, shift the start_index to the left by 1.', 'Expand the size of each shifted object to 3 by adding one pixel of the same color to both the left and right of the original single pixel.', 'Keep all other objects with size greater than 1 unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}

conditions: When there are multiple objects of the same color, smaller objects change to match the size of the largest object and move one position to the left.

Objects that are already the largest size or are alone of their color will remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and identify all objects, noting their color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Group objects by color.', 'For each color group, find the object with the largest size.', 'For each object in a color group that is not the largest, perform the following steps:', 'Increase the size of the object to match the size of the largest object of the same color.', 'Shift the start index of the object one position to the left.', 'Adjust the end index to maintain the new size after the shift.', 'Objects that are already the largest size or are the only one of their color should remain unchanged.', 'Update the sequence with the transformed objects to produce the output.']

Objects that are already the largest size or are alone of their color will remain unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and identify all objects, noting their color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Group objects by color.', 'For each color group, find the object with the largest size.', 'For each object in a color group that is not the largest, perform the following steps:', 'Increase the size of the object to match the size of the largest object of the same color.', 'Shift the start index of the object one position to the left.', 'Adjust the end index to maintain the new size after the shift.', 'Objects that are already the largest size or are the only one of their color should remain unchanged.', 'Update the sequence with the transformed objects to produce the output.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
