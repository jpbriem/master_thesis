Each object within the test input sequence has been identified, and the start_index and end_index of Object_1 have been increased by 1 to shift the object one position to the right. The color and size of Object_1 have remained unchanged, and the output sequence has been generated with the transformed object. The position previously occupied by the object's start_index has been filled with the background color (0). The test output does not exceed the sequence bounds; hence no adjustment to the sequence dimension or specific behavior was necessary. The test output analysis shows that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output follows the transformation steps correctly. The input object with color 2 starts at index 0 and ends at index 23, with a size of 24. Following the overall pattern, the object's start_index and end_index should both increase by 1. The example outputs confirm that the transformation pattern is to shift the object one position to the right. The output correctly shows the object starting at index 1 and ending at index 24, maintaining the color and size of the object as per the transformation steps. Additionally, the position previously occupied by the object's start_index (index 0) would be filled with the background color, which is consistent with the output. Since there is no behavior specified for when an object cannot be shifted without exceeding the sequence bounds, and the object in the test case does not exceed the sequence bounds after the shift, the transformation is applied correctly.\", \"value\": 10}"
