You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: the changes are consistently triggered by the presence of a small object with size 1 and color 9
overall pattern: for objects in the input, if there is a second object with color 9 and size 1, the first object's color changes to the color of the second object. The second object then moves to a new position to the right and inherits the color and size of the first object. The size of the objects remains unchanged

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the object with color 9 remains stationary and acts as a pivot for the swap. The size of the first object does not change, but its position shifts to the right by a number of positions equal to its size minus 1. The first object also adopts the color of the second object, which is always 9, and the second object adopts the color of the first object and moves to the initial position of the second object
overall pattern: For any input, find the two objects. Swap the colors of the two objects. Move the first object to the right by the number of positions equal to its size minus 1. Place the second object, which now has the color of the first object, in the initial position of the second object before the transformation

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the object with color 9 remains stationary and acts as a pivot for the swap. The size of the first object does not change, but its position shifts to the right by a number of positions equal to its size minus 1. The first object also adopts the color of the second object, which is always 9, and the second object adopts the color of the first object and moves to the initial position of the second object
overall pattern: For any input, find the two objects. Swap the colors of the two objects. Move the first object to the right by the number of positions equal to its size minus 1. Place the second object, which now has the color of the first object, in the initial position of the second object before the transformation


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence', 'Swap the colors of the first object and the object with color 9', 'Move the first object to the right by the number of positions equal to its size minus 1', 'Place the second object (now with the color of the first object) in the initial position of the object with color 9']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The object with color 9 always swaps its position and color with the other object, while the other object moves to a new start index that is the end index of the original color 9 object plus a certain number of indices to the right

Swap their colors, then move the color 9 object to the original position of the other object and move the other object to a new start index, which is the original end index of the color 9 object plus a constant number of indices to the right. The size of the objects remains unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Record the color, start index, end index, and size of both objects.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Place the object now colored 9 at the start index of the originally different-colored object, keeping its size constant.', 'Calculate the new start index for the object that was originally color 9 by adding 3 to the end index of its original position.', 'Place the newly recolored object (previously color 9) at its new start index, keeping its size constant.', 'Fill the background with 0s where necessary to maintain the dimension of the sequence.']

overall pattern:
conditions: The object with color 9 always swaps its position and color with the other object, while the other object moves to a new start index that is the end index of the original color 9 object plus a certain number of indices to the right
overall pattern: For any input, identify the object with color 9 and the other object. Swap their colors, then move the color 9 object to the original position of the other object and move the other object to a new start index, which is the original end index of the color 9 object plus a constant number of indices to the right. The size of the objects remains unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Record the color, start index, end index, and size of both objects.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Place the object now colored 9 at the start index of the originally different-colored object, keeping its size constant.', 'Calculate the new start index for the object that was originally color 9 by adding 3 to the end index of its original position.', 'Place the newly recolored object (previously color 9) at its new start index, keeping its size constant.', 'Fill the background with 0s where necessary to maintain the dimension of the sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 28],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
