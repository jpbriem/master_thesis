The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change size based on the largest object present of the same color. Smaller objects grow to match the size of the largest object.\noverall pattern: For objects of the same color, identify the largest object. Increase the size of smaller objects to match the largest object's size. Move the start index of these growing objects one position to the left.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of the largest object for each color.', 'For each object of that color that is smaller than the largest object:', '  - Increase the size of the object to match the size of the largest object of the same color.', '  - Move the start index of the object one position to the left.', '  - Adjust the end index to reflect the new size while maintaining the new start index.', 'If the new start index of an object is less than 0 after being moved, set the start index to 0.', 'Ensure that the object does not extend beyond the original dimension of the sequence. If it does, truncate the object to fit within the allowed dimension.', 'Replace the original object in the sequence with the transformed object, preserving the order of objects and background pixels.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
