You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when there are two objects of the same color, regardless of the space between them or their initial sizes.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color. Merge objects of the same color into a single object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object, thereby increasing the size to cover the entire range between the two objects. This rule applies regardless of the initial distance between the objects or their sizes.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are combined into a single object if they have the same color and are separated by background pixels. The number of objects is reduced accordingly.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color that are not contiguous. Merge these objects into one, such that the new object's start_index is the same as the first object's start_index, and the new object's end_index is the same as the last object's end_index. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the background pixels between them.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects with the same color in the input sequence', 'Verify that there are background pixels between these objects, indicating they are separate', 'Determine the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the last object', 'Count the number of background pixels between the objects', 'Create a new object with the same color', "Set the new object's start_index to that of the first object", "Set the new object's end_index to that of the last object", 'Calculate the size of the new object as the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the intervening background pixels', 'Replace the original objects and the background pixels between them in the sequence with the new object']

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects:

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.

output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are combined into a single object if they have the same color and are separated by background pixels. The number of objects is reduced accordingly.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color that are not contiguous. Merge these objects into one, such that the new object's start_index is the same as the first object's start_index, and the new object's end_index is the same as the last object's end_index. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the background pixels between them.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with the same color in the input sequence', 'Verify that there are background pixels between these objects, indicating they are separate', 'Determine the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the last object', 'Count the number of background pixels between the objects', 'Create a new object with the same color', "Set the new object's start_index to that of the first object", "Set the new object's end_index to that of the last object", 'Calculate the size of the new object as the sum of the sizes of the original objects plus the intervening background pixels', 'Replace the original objects and the background pixels between them in the sequence with the new object']

Value Prompt:
#####
system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: When there are multiple objects of the same color that are not adjacent, the objects are merged into a single object spanning the entire distance from the first to the last object of that color.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects of the same color that are not adjacent. Merge these objects into one continuous object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the last object, changing the size accordingly to cover the entire span.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the same color in the input sequence.', 'Check for non-adjacent objects of the same color.', 'Determine the start index of the first object of the matching color.', 'Determine the end index of the last object of the matching color.', 'Merge the non-adjacent objects into a single object by filling in the pixels between the determined start and end indices with the same color.', 'The size of the new merged object is the difference between the end index and the start index plus one.', 'Remove the original individual objects, leaving only the new merged object.', 'Keep all other objects and pixels in the sequence unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 10],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 10]
transformed objects: [{'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 4}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output seems to follow the transformation pattern correctly. The test input had two non-adjacent objects of the same color (3), which were at indices 4 and 7. According to the transformation steps, these objects should be merged into a single continuous object. The start index of the new object should be the start index of the first object (4), and the end index should be the end index of the last object (7). The size of the new object is correctly calculated as the difference between the end and start indices plus one (7 - 4 + 1 = 4). The output object is {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 4}, which matches the expected result given the transformation rules. No other objects or pixels were changed, which is also in line with the instructions.",

In the input, there are two non-adjacent objects of the same color (color 3, at indices 4 and 7). According to the transformation pattern, these objects should be merged into a single object spanning from the first object's start index to the last object's end index. The transformation steps were followed: identifying the objects with the same color (step 1), checking for non-adjacency (step 2), determining the start index (step 3) and end index (step 4), merging the objects (step 5), calculating the new size (step 6), and removing the original objects (step 7). The size of the new object is indeed the difference between the end index (7) and the start index (4) plus one, which is 4. Therefore, the output sequence is correct, with a single object of color 3 starting at index 4 and ending at index 7 with the correct size of 4.",
