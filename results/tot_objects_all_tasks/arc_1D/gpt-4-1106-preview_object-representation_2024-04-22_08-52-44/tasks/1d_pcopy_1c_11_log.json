It then expands to match the size of the first object in the sequence.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, if there are multiple objects and one of the objects has a size of 1, then that object expands to the left and the right by one unit each to match the size of the largest object present, which is usually the first object. The color of the object does not change during this transformation.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the sequence', 'Determine the size of the first object in the sequence', 'Find any object with a size of 1', 'Expand the identified size-1 object to the left by one unit and to the right by one unit, so that its new size equals the size of the first object', 'Maintain the color of the size-1 object during expansion', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 33]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test input sequence contains three objects. According to the transformation steps, the first object is of size 3 and remains unchanged. The second and third objects are each of size 1, and thus according to the transformation pattern, they should expand to the left and right by one unit each to match the size of the first object. The transformation was correctly applied to Object_2, which expanded from a size of 1 to a size of 3 by adding one unit to the left and one unit to the right, resulting in a start index of 6 and an end index of 8. The same transformation was correctly applied to Object_3, which also expanded from a size of 1 to a size of 3 by adding one unit to the left and one unit to the right, resulting in a start index of 10 and an end index of 12. All objects maintained their original color, which is 3, as per the instructions. No other objects or background pixels were altered during this transformation. Based on this analysis, the transformation of the test input into the test output appears to have been performed correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test case output follows the transformation steps correctly. The input had three objects with the second and third objects each of a size of 1. According to the transformation pattern, each size-1 object should expand to match the size of the first object, which is 3. The test output shows that both Object_2 and Object_3 have been expanded correctly by one unit to the left and one unit to the right, thus matching the size of the first object, while maintaining their color.
