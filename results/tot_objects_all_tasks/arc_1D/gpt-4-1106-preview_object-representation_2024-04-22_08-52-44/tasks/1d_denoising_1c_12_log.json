For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 10}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 10}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 13}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 14}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects change based on their size; smaller objects are removed\noverall pattern: remove all objects except the largest one, regardless of their color or position, leaving the largest object unchanged in the output\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify and list all objects in the input sequence.', 'Measure and compare the size of each object to determine the largest one.', 'If there are multiple objects of the same largest size, choose the first one encountered in the sequence.', 'Remove all objects from the sequence except for the largest one identified in the previous steps.', 'Output the sequence with only the largest object remaining in its original position and state.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
