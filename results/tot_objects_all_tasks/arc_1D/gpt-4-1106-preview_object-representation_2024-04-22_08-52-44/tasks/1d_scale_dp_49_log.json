According to the overall pattern, the first object should expand in size to fill up to three pixels before the start index of the second object, while keeping its color and start index the same. The second object should remain unchanged. In the test case, the start index of the second object is 24. Therefore, the end index of the first object should be 24 - 3 = 21. However, the size of the first object should be calculated as 21 (end index) - 6 (start index) + 1 = 16. The 'size' field for the first object in the transformed output is incorrectly stated as 16, which matches the initial size from the input, but the 'end_index' should be 21, not 20. Hence, the expansion of the first object is not reflected in the 'end_index' and 'size' fields.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output does not conform to the transformation pattern described. According to the pattern, the first object should expand in size to fill the space up to three pixels before the start index of the second object, while its color and start index remain the same. The second object should remain unchanged. In the test case, the first object's size should have been expanded so that its end index is 20 (three pixels before the second object's start index at 24), instead of remaining at 21. The size should have been adjusted to 15 (start index 6 to end index 20 inclusive). As the transformed output did not expand the first object to the correct size and the end index is not three pixels before the start index of the second object, the transformation was not applied correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}"
