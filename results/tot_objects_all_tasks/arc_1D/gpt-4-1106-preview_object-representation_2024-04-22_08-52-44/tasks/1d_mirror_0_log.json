For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 8}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 8}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 8}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change colors with each other and move to the right. The smaller object always moves by a number of positions equal to its size, while the larger object moves by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start position to the start position of the smaller object.\noverall pattern: For any input sequence, identify the two objects. Swap their colors. Move the smaller object to the right by a number of positions equal to its size. Move the larger object to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start to the start of the smaller object.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'Swap the colors of the two identified objects.', 'Move the smaller object (size 1) to the right by a number of positions equal to its size (1 position).', 'Calculate the original distance from the start position of the larger object to the start position of the smaller object.', 'Move the larger object to the right by a number of positions equal to the calculated distance.', 'Ensure that the rest of the sequence remains filled with the background color, represented by 0.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

The sizes of the objects post-transformation are correct, but their positions have been mishandled. According to the transformation rules, the smaller object (size 1) should move to the right by 1 position, starting from its original position index 10, which would place it at index 11. This part is correctly applied in the output. However, the larger object (size 9) should move to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from its original start position to the start of the smaller object, which is 10 - 0 = 10 positions. Therefore, the larger object should start at index 0 + 10 = 10. But in the test output, the larger object starts at index 10, overlapping the new position of the smaller object, and ends at index 19, which is incorrect. The larger object should start at index 10 and end at index 18 to maintain its size of 9. Additionally, there is a logical error, as the smaller object is shown to have moved by more than 1 position, and the larger object has shifted to start where the smaller object should be. The correct transformed positions should be: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output has incorrectly transformed the input sequence. The transformation steps require the smaller object to move to the right by an amount equal to its size, which is 1 position in this case. However, the object with color 9 (which is the smaller object) is shown to have moved from start_index 10 to start_index 11, a shift of only 1 position, which is correct. The larger object, originally with color 1, should have swapped colors with the smaller object and moved to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from its start to the start of the smaller object, which is 10 (from index 0 to index 10). Instead, the larger object (now color 9) is incorrectly shown to have moved from start_index 0 to start_index 10, a shift of 10 positions, and spans from index 10 to 19, which is incorrect as the move should have resulted in the object spanning from index 20 to 28 after the transformation. Furthermore, the smaller object (now color 1) should have a start_index and end_index of 12 after the transformation, not 11 as indicated. Therefore, the output is not consistent with the transformation pattern.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}"
