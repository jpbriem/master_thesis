The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}.

The steps involved identifying the object and its main color, counting the occurrence of each color, determining the main color (which is 6), and then recoloring all pixels within the object to the main color. The output sequence shows that all pixels are now color 6, which complies with the overall pattern that any pixel within an object that does not match the object's main color should be recolored to match the main color. The size and position of the object remain unchanged in the output sequence, maintaining the original structure as specified in the transformation steps.\", \"value\": 10}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.
