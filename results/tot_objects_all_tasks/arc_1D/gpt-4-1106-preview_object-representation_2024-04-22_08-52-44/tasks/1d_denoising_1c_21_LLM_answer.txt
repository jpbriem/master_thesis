You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the largest object by size is retained while smaller objects are removed. There are no changes in color, position, or size of the remaining object.
overall pattern: Identify the largest object by size within the input sequence. Remove all other objects regardless of their color or position, leaving the largest object unchanged in the output sequence.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to locate all objects, defined as adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'For each object found, record its color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Create a list of all objects and sort it by size in descending order.', 'Retain the object with the largest size. If there are multiple objects of the same largest size, retain the first one encountered in the input.', 'Remove all other objects from the sequence by replacing their pixels with the background color (0).', 'Output the modified sequence, which should only contain the largest object from the input sequence.']

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, the largest object by size is retained while smaller objects are removed. There are no changes in color, position, or size of the remaining object.
overall pattern: Identify the largest object by size within the input sequence. Remove all other objects regardless of their color or position, leaving the largest object unchanged in the output sequence.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to locate all objects, defined as adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'For each object found, record its color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Create a list of all objects and sort it by size in descending order.', 'Retain the object with the largest size. If there are multiple objects of the same largest size, retain the first one encountered in the input.', 'Remove all other objects from the sequence by replacing their pixels with the background color (0).', 'Output the modified sequence, which should only contain the largest object from the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation pattern correctly. The input sequence had multiple objects of the same color, and the largest object by size was Object_1 with a size of 13. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, all other objects should be removed, leaving only the largest object unchanged in the output sequence. The test output shows just Object_1 retained, and its color, start index, end index, and size remain unchanged, which is consistent with the specified transformation pattern. Thus, the transformation was applied correctly.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly follows the transformation steps. The input sequence is scanned and all objects are identified, with their respective color, start index, end index, and size recorded. The list of objects is then sorted by size, and the largest object (Object_1) is correctly retained. All smaller objects (Object_2, Object_3, Object_4, and Object_5) are removed as their pixels should be replaced with the background color (0). The output sequence contains only the largest object, unchanged, which aligns with the overall pattern described where the largest object by size is retained while smaller objects are removed. There are no changes in color, position, or size of the remaining object. The test output correctly reflects these instructions.", "value": 10}
