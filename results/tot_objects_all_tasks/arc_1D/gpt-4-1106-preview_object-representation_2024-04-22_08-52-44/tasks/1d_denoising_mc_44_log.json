The input sequence was scanned to identify the object based on adjacency and color, which was done correctly. The dominant color within the object was determined to be 7, which is correct as it appears most frequently. All non-dominant colors (6 and 9) were replaced with the dominant color 7, in accordance with the transformation pattern. The original size and position of the object were maintained, and the background pixels (color 0) remained unchanged.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test case output was analyzed based on the transformation steps provided. The input sequence had an object with a dominant color of 7, with other colors present including 6 and 9. According to the transformation steps, all non-dominant colors within the object should be replaced with the dominant color while maintaining the size and position of the object. The output sequence correctly shows that all non-dominant colors were replaced with 7, and the size and position of the object remained unchanged, with the coordinates range and size of the object matching the input.
