You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Large objects are moved towards the center of the sequence, while small objects remain in place. The amount of shift seems to depend on the initial position of the large object.
overall pattern: If an object’s size is greater than a threshold (seems to be greater than 1 in the examples), move the object towards the center of the sequence without changing its size or color. The amount of indices it is moved seems to be dependent on its starting index, moving it closer to the center of the overall dimension. Small objects (size of 1) remain unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with size greater than 1 are moved to the right by a certain number of positions, while single-sized objects are left intact
overall pattern: For objects larger than size 1, move the object to the right by the number of positions equal to the distance between the object's start index and the first index (1, if zero-indexed). The color and size of the objects remain unchanged. Objects of size 1 are not moved.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, check the size of the object', "If the size of the object is greater than 1, calculate the distance from the object's start index to the first index", 'Move the object to the right by the number of positions equal to this distance', 'Ensure that the color and size of the object remain unchanged after the move', 'If the object is of size 1, do not move it', 'Repeat the steps for all objects greater than size 1 in the sequence', 'Output the transformed sequence with the objects in their new positions']

However, since the dimension is only [1, 15], the end index should be truncated to 14, making the size of Object_1 after transformation 5 (start_index 10 to end_index 14). Object_2 remains at start_index 14, but this creates an overlap with Object_1, which is not allowed. Object_2 should have been shifted to the next available index, which is 15, but since that is outside the dimension range, it should be removed or truncated. Instead, Object_2 is incorrectly shown at index 14, which is now occupied by Object_1. The correct output should have Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 5}, and Object_2 should be removed or indicated as truncated.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

overall pattern:
conditions: If there is more than one object, the larger object is moved to the right by a number of places equal to the difference between its size and the size of the smaller object. The smaller object remains in the same position
overall pattern: Identify the larger and smaller objects. Move the larger object to the right by the difference in size between the two objects. Leave the smaller object unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence by locating contiguous non-zero pixels.', 'Determine the size of each object by counting the number of contiguous non-zero pixels.', 'Compare the sizes of the identified objects to determine the larger and smaller objects.', 'Calculate the difference in size between the larger and smaller objects.', 'Move the larger object to the right by a number of places equal to the calculated size difference.', 'Ensure the smaller object remains in its original position in the sequence.', 'Fill the vacated positions of the larger object, if any, with the background color (0).', 'Maintain the original sequence length by ensuring that any excess pixels resulting from the movement are truncated or that the sequence is padded with the background color (0) as necessary.']
