You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects larger than size 1 are moved 2 positions to the right. Objects of size 1 do not change position.
overall pattern: If an object's size is greater than 1, move it 2 positions to the right, keeping color and size constant; objects of size 1 remain unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, check if the size is greater than 1', "If an object's size is greater than 1, move the object 2 positions to the right by increasing its start_index and end_index by 2", "If an object's size is equal to 1, do not change its position", "Keep the object's color unchanged", "Keep the object's size unchanged", 'Ensure that the transformation does not overlap with other objects and respects the sequence boundaries']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 18], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects larger than size 1 are moved 2 positions to the right; their color and size remain unchanged. Objects of size 1 do not move and their color and size remain unchanged
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move objects larger than size 1 exactly 2 positions to the right while keeping their color and size unaltered. Objects of size 1 should remain stationary


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, check if the size is greater than 1', 'If the size is greater than 1, move the object exactly 2 positions to the right', 'Maintain the color and size of the object during the move', 'Do not move objects of size 1', 'Leave the background color (0) unchanged']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 18],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 18]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
