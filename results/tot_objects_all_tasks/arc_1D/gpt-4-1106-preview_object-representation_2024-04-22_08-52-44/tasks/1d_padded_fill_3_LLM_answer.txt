You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The pattern involves pairing objects that are an even distance apart and merging them into a single larger object. The start_index of the resulting object is that of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is that of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object spans the entire range of indices from the first to the second object inclusively
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are an even distance apart. Merge each pair into one object, with the new size being the difference between the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object plus one. The start and end indices of the new object are the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object of the pair

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to pairs of consecutive single-size objects of the same color that are separated by a certain distance
overall pattern: For any input, identify pairs of consecutive objects of the same color with a size of 1. These pairs are transformed into a single object that spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object, increasing the size to the count of indices covered by both objects, including the space in between

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: The pattern involves pairing objects that are an even distance apart and merging them into a single larger object. The start_index of the resulting object is that of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is that of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object spans the entire range of indices from the first to the second object inclusively
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are an even distance apart. Merge each pair into one object, with the new size being the difference between the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object plus one. The start and end indices of the new object are the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object of the pair

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color expand their size to reach the next object of the same color
overall pattern: for objects of the same color, keep the starting index and extend the end index to match the starting index of the next object of the same color; if there is no subsequent object, expand to the maximum size defined by the pattern



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the color matches the color of the subsequent object.', 'If the object is of size 1 and the subsequent object is of the same color, change the end index of the current object to be one less than the start index of the next object.', 'If there is no subsequent object of the same color, expand the object to the maximum size defined by the pattern (size of 20 for color 2, size of 25 for color 6, size of 17 for color 1).', 'Update the size of the object to reflect the new end index.', 'Repeat this process for each object in the sequence.', 'Remove the original single pixel objects that have been expanded into larger objects.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color expand their size to reach the next object of the same color
overall pattern: for objects of the same color, keep the starting index and extend the end index to match the starting index of the next object of the same color; if there is no subsequent object, expand to the maximum size defined by the pattern


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the color matches the color of the subsequent object.', 'If the object is of size 1 and the subsequent object is of the same color, change the end index of the current object to be one less than the start index of the next object.', 'If there is no subsequent object of the same color, expand the object to the maximum size defined by the pattern (size of 20 for color 2, size of 25 for color 6, size of 17 for color 1).', 'Update the size of the object to reflect the new end index.', 'Repeat this process for each object in the sequence.', 'Remove the original single pixel objects that have been expanded into larger objects.']

overall pattern:
conditions: The pattern involves pairing objects that are an even distance apart and merging them into a single larger object. The start_index of the resulting object is that of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is that of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object spans the entire range of indices from the first to the second object inclusively
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are an even distance apart. Merge each pair into one object, with the new size being the difference between the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object plus one. The start and end indices of the new object are the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object of the pair


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the sequence.', 'For each object, calculate the distance to every other object of the same color.', 'Select pairs of objects where the calculated distance is an even number.', 'For each selected pair, merge the two objects into a single object.

overall pattern:
conditions: The pattern involves pairing objects that are an even distance apart and merging them into a single larger object. The start_index of the resulting object is that of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is that of the second object in the pair. The size of the new object spans the entire range of indices from the first to the second object inclusively
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are an even distance apart. Merge each pair into one object, with the new size being the difference between the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object plus one. The start and end indices of the new object are the start_index of the first and the end_index of the second object of the pair


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color within the sequence.', 'For each object, calculate the distance to every other object of the same color.', 'Select pairs of objects where the calculated distance is an even number.', 'For each selected pair, merge the two objects into a single object. The start_index of the new object is the start_index of the first object in the pair, and the end_index is the end_index of the second object in the pair.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by taking the difference between the end_index and the start_index of the merged pair and adding one.', 'Replace the original objects in the pair with the new merged object in the output sequence.', 'Repeat the process for all pairs of objects that meet the conditions.', "Maintain the sequence's original dimension."]
