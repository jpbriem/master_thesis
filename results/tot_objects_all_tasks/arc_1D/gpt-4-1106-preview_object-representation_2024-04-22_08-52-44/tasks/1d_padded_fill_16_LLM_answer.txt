You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects change if they are of the same color and are in pairs with specific consistent spacing between them

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 72], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 41, 'end_index': 41, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 44, 'end_index': 44, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 65, 'end_index': 65, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 68, 'end_index': 68, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 72], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 67, 'end_index': 67, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 72], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 18}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 18}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 67, 'size': 18}

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes occur when there are pairs of objects of the same color separated by a fixed distance. This distance determines how much the size of the resulting object will increase.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a constant distance. Merge these pairs by filling the space between them with the same color, effectively increasing the size of the objects to include the space that was between them.



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Determine the color of each object.', 'For each object, find the nearest object of the same color.', 'Measure the distance between objects of the same color.', 'If the distance between the two objects is consistent with the fixed distance identified in the overall pattern, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, skip to the next pair.', 'Merge the pair of objects by changing the value of the pixels in the space between the objects to the color of the objects, thus creating a single larger object.', 'Repeat the process for all objects in the input sequence.', 'The output sequence should now reflect the merged objects with increased size.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 72], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 67, 'end_index': 67, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes occur when there are pairs of objects of the same color separated by a fixed distance. This distance determines how much the size of the resulting object will increase.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a constant distance. Merge these pairs by filling the space between them with the same color, effectively increasing the size of the objects to include the space that was between them.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Determine the color of each object.', 'For each object, find the nearest object of the same color.', 'Measure the distance between objects of the same color.', 'If the distance between the two objects is consistent with the fixed distance identified in the overall pattern, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, skip to the next pair.', 'Merge the pair of objects by changing the value of the pixels in the space between the objects to the color of the objects, thus creating a single larger object.', 'Repeat the process for all objects in the input sequence.', 'The output sequence should now reflect the merged objects with increased size.']


Test case:

overall pattern:
conditions: The changes occur when there are pairs of objects of the same color separated by a fixed distance. This distance determines how much the size of the resulting object will increase.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a constant distance. Merge these pairs by filling the space between them with the same color, effectively increasing the size of the objects to include the space that was between them.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Determine the color of each object.', 'For each object, find the nearest object of the same color.', 'Measure the distance between objects of the same color.', 'If the distance between the two objects is consistent with the fixed distance identified in the overall pattern, proceed to the next step.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by a constant distance. Merge these pairs by filling the space between them with the same color, effectively increasing the size of the objects to include the space that was between them.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Determine the color of each object.', 'For each object, find the nearest object of the same color.', 'Measure the distance between objects of the same color.', 'If the distance between the two objects is consistent with the fixed distance identified in the overall pattern, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, skip to the next pair.', 'Merge the pair of objects by changing the value of the pixels in the space between the objects to the color of the objects, thus creating a single larger object.', 'Repeat the process for all objects in the input sequence.', 'The output sequence should now reflect the merged objects with increased size.']
