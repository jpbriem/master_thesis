The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

According to the transformation steps, the largest object should be retained while all other objects should be removed. The test output retains Object_1 and its properties (color, position, size) are unchanged. All other objects are removed and the rest of the sequence is filled with the background color, 0. The transformation steps were followed correctly, and the test output is consistent with the overall pattern of retaining only the largest object.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The provided test output follows the transformation instructions correctly. The input sequence was scanned and all objects were identified as per the first step. The sizes of these objects were calculated in the second step. The largest object, Object_1, with a size of 11, was correctly identified in the third and fourth steps. According to the fifth and sixth steps, all other objects except for the largest one were removed, and the largest object's color, position, and size were preserved in the output sequence. Finally, the rest of the output sequence was filled with the background color, which is consistent with the seventh step. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.\", \"value\": 10}"
