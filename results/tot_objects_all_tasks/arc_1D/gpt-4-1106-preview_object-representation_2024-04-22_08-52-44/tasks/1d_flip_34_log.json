The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

If they do, swap them while keeping the rest of the object unchanged. This pattern applies regardless of the object's size or the specific colors involved.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions are relevant as they pertain to the state of the object's first and last pixels, which are essential for determining the transformation.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation from input to output, as the first and last pixels are swapped, which is the observed change.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides a clear rule for the transformation regarding the first and last pixels of an object.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions refer to the input and are relevant for identifying the necessary change in the object's color sequence.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is accurately observed in the transformation from input to output, with the first and last pixel colors being swapped.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is sufficiently precise, indicating exactly when and how to modify the input sequence to obtain the output.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are applicable as they focus on the input object's first and last pixels, which are key to the transformation process.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The pattern describes the transformation process correctly, as it involves swapping the first and last pixels as seen in the example.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern provides a clear and precise rule for transforming the input to the output, ensuring consistent application across different inputs.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions are relevant to determine the object changes as they specifically look at the first and last pixel of the object which are indeed different in this example.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation from input to output for this example.
