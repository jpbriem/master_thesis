The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

If the size is an even number or not a multiple of 5, the object's color changes to 3.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, for each object, check the size. If the size is an odd number (including multiples of 5), change the color to 7. For all other sizes, change the color to 3. Keep the size and position of the objects unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Iterate over each object in the input sequence.', 'Check the size of the current object.', \"If the size is an odd number (including multiples of 5), change the object's color to 7.\", \"If the size is an even number or not a multiple of 5, change the object's color to 3.\", 'Keep the position and size of the object unchanged in the output sequence.', 'Repeat the above steps for each object in the sequence.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 3}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 32]\ntransformed objects: The transformed objects for the test output are: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 3}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output transformation follows the overall pattern and the transformation steps correctly.
