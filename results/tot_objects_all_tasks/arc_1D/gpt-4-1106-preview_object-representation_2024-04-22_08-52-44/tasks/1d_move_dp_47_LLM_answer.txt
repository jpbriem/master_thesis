You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Larger objects move to the right by a number of positions equal to their color number minus four. The smallest object does not change
overall pattern: For objects larger than the smallest one, move the object to the right by a number of positions equal to the color of the object minus four. Keep the size and color unchanged. Do not move the smallest object


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of the smallest object in the sequence.', 'For each object that is larger than the smallest object:', "Calculate the number of positions to move by subtracting four from the object's color.", 'Move the object to the right by the calculated number of positions.', 'Keep the size and color of the object unchanged.', 'Leave the smallest object in its original position.', 'Output the transformed sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 21]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output shows that Object_1, with a color value of 5, has been moved to the right by 1 position, starting at index 12 and ending at index 14. This is incorrect according to the overall pattern and transformation steps, which state that objects larger than the smallest one should be moved to the right by a number of positions equal to their color number minus four. Since Object_1's color is 5, it should have been moved to the right by (5 - 4) = 1 position. However, the start and end indices of Object_1 in the output should have been 12 and 14 respectively, which is correctly reflected in the test output. Object_2, being the smallest object with a size of 1, remains unchanged, which is correct. The start and end indices of Object_2 are 19 in both input and output, which is consistent with the pattern. The mistake in the output is minor and only pertains to the description of the transformation rather than the actual output.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input sequence contains two objects, where Object_1 is of color 5 and size 3, and Object_2 is of color 1 and size 1. According to the transformation steps, we identify all objects and determine the size of the smallest object, which is Object_2 with size 1. Object_1 is larger and should be moved to the right by the color number minus four (5 - 4 = 1). Thus, Object_1 should move from starting indices 11-13 to 12-14, which is correctly reflected in the test output. Object_2 remains in its original position since it's the smallest object. The transformation steps have been followed correctly, and the test output matches the expected transformation.",
