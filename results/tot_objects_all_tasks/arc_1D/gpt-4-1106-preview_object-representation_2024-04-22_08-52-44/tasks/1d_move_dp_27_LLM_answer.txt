You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern: For any input sequence, move the first object that is not of color 9 to the right by the difference between its size and a constant value. If there’s a second object of color 9, it remains unchanged. The constant value is determined by the position of the object in the sequence. For the first object, this constant value appears to be the size of the object minus 2.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 9], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects seem to move to the right based on their size. The number of steps moved is equal to the object's size for objects with size 3 or 5, and size minus one for an object with size 4. Object_2 remains static, suggesting that it may serve as a reference point or that the rules only apply to other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: For an object with size 3 or 5, move the object to the right by a number of steps equal to its size. For an object with size 4, move the object to the right by size minus one step. Leave objects of color 9 unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the sequence.', 'For each object, determine if the color is not 9.', "If the object's color is not 9, check the size of the object.", 'If the size of the object is 3 or 5, move the object to the right by a number of steps equal to its size.', 'If the size of the object is 4, move the object to the right by a number of steps equal to its size minus one.', 'For objects of color 9, do not apply any transformation.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not cause objects to overlap or exceed the boundaries of the sequence dimension.']

overall pattern: For any input sequence, move the first object that is not of color 9 to the right by the difference between its size and a constant value. If there’s a second object of color 9, it remains unchanged. The constant value is determined by the position of the object in the sequence. For the first object, this constant value appears to be the size of the object minus 2.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the input sequence that is not of color 9.', 'Calculate the number of positions to move the first object to the right, which is the size of the object minus 2.', 'Shift the first object to the right by the calculated number of positions.', 'Leave the second object, if it is of color 9, at its original position in the sequence.']

conditions: Objects seem to move to the right based on their size. The number of steps moved is equal to the object's size for objects with size 3 or 5, and size minus one for an object with size 4. Object_2 remains static, suggesting that it may serve as a reference point or that the rules only apply to other objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: For an object with size 3 or 5, move the object to the right by a number of steps equal to its size. For an object with size 4, move the object to the right by size minus one step. Leave objects of color 9 unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the sequence.', 'For each object, determine if the color is not 9.', "If the object's color is not 9, check the size of the object.", 'If the size of the object is 3 or 5, move the object to the right by a number of steps equal to its size.', 'If the size of the object is 4, move the object to the right by a number of steps equal to its size minus one.', 'For objects of color 9, do not apply any transformation.', 'Ensure that the transformation does not cause objects to overlap or exceed the boundaries of the sequence dimension.']
