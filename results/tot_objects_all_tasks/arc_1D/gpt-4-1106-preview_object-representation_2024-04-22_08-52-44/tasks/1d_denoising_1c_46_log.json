For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 15}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation pattern is based on the size of the objects. The largest object of a given color is kept, while all smaller objects of the same color are removed.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with the same color, keep the largest object of each color, and remove all other objects of that color.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence', 'Determine the size of each object by calculating the difference between its end_index and start_index plus one', 'Locate the object with the largest size for each color', 'Remove all other objects of the same color, leaving only the largest object in the sequence', 'Output the modified sequence with only the largest object of each color remaining']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
