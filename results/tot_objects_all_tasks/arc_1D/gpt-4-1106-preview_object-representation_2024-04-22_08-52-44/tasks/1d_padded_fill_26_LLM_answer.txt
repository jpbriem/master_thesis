You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color are merged into a single object if there is a consistent number of background pixels between them specific to their color
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a specific number of background pixels between them (4 for color 2, 24 for color 3, 6 for color 1). Merge these pairs into larger objects by extending the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object and removing the second object, while adjusting the size accordingly



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'For each color, determine the specific number of background pixels that indicate possible merging (4 for color 2, 24 for color 3, 6 for color 1).', 'Find pairs of objects of the same color that have the specified number of background pixels between them.', 'For each pair found in step 3, merge the two objects by extending the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object.', 'Adjust the size of the merged object to encompass the total number of pixels from the first and second object, including the background pixels between them.', 'Remove the second object from the sequence after merging.', 'Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all possible objects of the same color that can be merged have been processed.', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color are merged into a single object if there is a consistent number of background pixels between them specific to their color
overall pattern: to transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that have a specific number of background pixels between them (4 for color 2, 24 for color 3, 6 for color 1). Merge these pairs into larger objects by extending the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object and removing the second object, while adjusting the size accordingly


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'For each color, determine the specific number of background pixels that indicate possible merging (4 for color 2, 24 for color 3, 6 for color 1).', 'Find pairs of objects of the same color that have the specified number of background pixels between them.', 'For each pair found in step 3, merge the two objects by extending the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object.', 'Adjust the size of the merged object to encompass the total number of pixels from the first and second object, including the background pixels between them.', 'Remove the second object from the sequence after merging.', 'Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all possible objects of the same color that can be merged have been processed.', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.']

Merge these pairs into larger objects by extending the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object and removing the second object, while adjusting the size accordingly


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color in the input sequence.', 'For each color, determine the specific number of background pixels that indicate possible merging (4 for color 2, 24 for color 3, 6 for color 1).', 'Find pairs of objects of the same color that have the specified number of background pixels between them.', 'For each pair found in step 3, merge the two objects by extending the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object.', 'Adjust the size of the merged object to encompass the total number of pixels from the first and second object, including the background pixels between them.', 'Remove the second object from the sequence after merging.', 'Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all possible objects of the same color that can be merged have been processed.', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.']
