The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The first object's color remains unchanged at 1, and its start_index remains at 5. The number of background pixels between the end of the first object and the start of the next object is calculated as 21 - 15 - 1 = 5. The size of the first object is expanded by these 5 background pixels, changing its size from 11 to 16, which also changes the end_index from 15 to 20. The second object remains unchanged, with its color at 4, start_index at 21, end_index at 21, and size at 1. Therefore, the output sequence correctly reflects the new size and end_index of the first object while keeping the rest of the sequence the same as the input.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output follows the transformation steps correctly. The first object in the input, Object_1, has been expanded to fill the background pixels between its end and the start of Object_2.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 20}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 24}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 19}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 20}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 22}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects expand to fill up the space between them and the next object, provided the next object is not an adjacent pixel. There are no changes in color or number of objects. Only the size and potentially the end_index of the first object changes\noverall pattern: For any input, the first object will grow to occupy any background pixels up to the pixel immediately before the next object. Its size will change accordingly, while its color and start_index remain the same.
