You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are consistently shifting to the right by one position regardless of their color, position, or size.
overall pattern: Every object shifts one pixel to the right from its original position. The color and size of the object do not change. This rule applies to all objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', "For each object, increment the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 1 to shift the object one position to the right.", "Retain the original 'color' of the object.", "Retain the original 'size' of the object.", 'If shifting an object results in it going beyond the bounds of the sequence, adjust the sequence dimension accordingly or crop the object, depending on the predefined behavior for such cases.', 'Ensure that the background color (0) remains consistent after the transformation.', 'Fill in the new gap on the left side of the object with the background color (0).']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 16],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 10}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 16]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were correctly followed for the given test case. The input object, Object_1, started from index 0 and ended at index 9, with a size of 10 and color 4. Following the transformation steps, the 'start_index' and 'end_index' were both incremented by 1, shifting the object to the right. The 'color' and 'size' remained unchanged as per the instructions. The test output shows Object_1 now starting at index 1 and ending at index 10, with the same size and color, which is correct. Additionally, the output dimension remains the same at [1, 16], and the new gap created on the left side of Object_1 has been filled with the background color (0). There is no mention of the object exceeding the bounds of the sequence, so there is no need for adjustment of the sequence dimension or cropping of the object. The background color consistency is maintained as well.", "value": 10}

{"test_output_analysis": "The test input sequence has an object that starts at index 0 and ends at index 9, which is of size 10 and color 4. According to the transformation steps, this object should be shifted one position to the right. The start_index should be incremented by 1 to 1, and the end_index should be incremented by 1 to 10. The color should remain 4, and the size should remain 10. The test output shows that these transformation steps have been correctly applied. The object is shifted to the right by one position without changing its color or size, and the background color remains consistent. The test output is correct based on the given transformation steps and the overall pattern.", "value": 10}
