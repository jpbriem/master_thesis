You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The smallest object in terms of size remains unchanged. Larger objects increase in size by adding pixels to their end_index until they are adjacent to either the next object or the sequence boundary.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the smallest object by size and leave it unchanged. Then, for each larger object, extend its size by adding pixels of the same color to its end_index until it reaches the next object or the sequence boundary.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and identify all objects within it.', 'Determine the size of each object and identify the smallest object.', 'Leave the smallest object unchanged.', 'For each larger object, extend the object by adding pixels of the same color to the end_index.', 'Continue to add pixels to the end_index until reaching either the start_index of the next object or the end of the sequence.', 'Ensure that the transformation preserves the original color of each object.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the objects modified according to the above steps.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 18}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The smallest object in terms of size remains unchanged. Larger objects increase in size by adding pixels to their end_index until they are adjacent to either the next object or the sequence boundary.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the smallest object by size and leave it unchanged. Then, for each larger object, extend its size by adding pixels of the same color to its end_index until it reaches the next object or the sequence boundary.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and identify all objects within it.', 'Determine the size of each object and identify the smallest object.', 'Leave the smallest object unchanged.', 'For each larger object, extend the object by adding pixels of the same color to the end_index.', 'Continue to add pixels to the end_index until reaching either the start_index of the next object or the end of the sequence.', 'Ensure that the transformation preserves the original color of each object.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the objects modified according to the above steps.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 20]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output for the given input sequence seems to be incorrect. The input sequence has two objects: Object_1 with color 4 and size 11, and Object_2 with color 9 and size 1. According to the overall pattern, the smallest object should remain unchanged, and larger objects should increase in size by adding pixels to their end_index until they are adjacent to the next object or the sequence boundary. The smallest object is Object_2, which correctly remains unchanged in the output. However, Object_1 should only have been extended up to the index before Object_2 starts, which is index 17. The end_index for Object_1 should be 17, which makes its size 16. The size has been expanded correctly to make the object adjacent to Object_2, but the end_index mentioned in the output is also 17 which is the same as the correct value. The correct output provided matches the rules of the overall pattern as Object_1 has been expanded until it is adjacent to Object_2, and Object_2 has remained the same. Therefore, the test output has been transformed correctly.",
  "value": 10

------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The given test output correctly follows the transformation pattern established by the examples. The test input has two objects, with Object_1 being larger than Object_2. According to the transformation pattern, the smallest object should remain unchanged, while the larger object should have pixels added to its end_index until it is adjacent to the next object or the sequence boundary. In this test case, Object_1 has been extended correctly from an end_index of 12 to an end_index of 17, as it now reaches the start_index of Object_2 without overlap, and Object_2 remains unchanged as it is the smaller object. The color of each object is preserved during the transformation, which is also in line with the pattern.",
