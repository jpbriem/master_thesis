The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 41, 'end_index': 41, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 51, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 41, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 39, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 48, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 10}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 10}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 39, 'end_index': 48, 'size': 10}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 49, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 51, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 54], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 49, 'end_index': 51, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects change if they are of the same color and are separated by a fixed number of background pixels\noverall pattern: combine every two consecutive objects of the same color into a single object whose size is the sum of the sizes of the two objects plus the distance between them, spanning from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'Determine the color of each object', 'For every pair of consecutive objects with the same color:', '  Calculate the distance between the end_index of the first object and the start_index of the second object', '  If the distance is fixed and meets the pattern criteria:', '    Combine the two objects into a single object', '    Set the start_index of the new object to the start_index of the first object', '    Set the end_index of the new object to the end_index of the second object', '    Calculate the size of the new object as the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance between them', '  If the distance does not meet the pattern criteria, do not combine the objects', 'Remove the original two objects that were combined from the sequence', 'Repeat the process for all consecutive object pairs that meet the criteria', 'Output the transformed sequence with the combined objects']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

The test input has six objects, all of the same color (3), and each object is a single pixel in size. According to the transformation steps and the overall pattern, for every pair of consecutive objects with the same color, the objects should be combined into a single object if they are separated by a fixed number of background pixels. The distance between the end_index of Object_1 (8) and the start_index of Object_2 (11) is 2, which is a fixed number that meets the pattern criteria. Hence, they are combined into a single object with a start_index of 8, an end_index of 11, and a size of 4 (the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance between them, which is 1+1+2). The same pattern is observed between Object_3 and Object_4, as well as between Object_5 and Object_6. The output objects have the correct start_index, end_index, and sizes as per the pattern. The transformation steps have been applied correctly, resulting in an output that correctly combines pairs of objects according to the given rules.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output appears to be incorrect. According to the transformation steps and the overall pattern, the size of the new combined object should be the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the distance between them. In the test case, the distance between Object_1 and Object_2 (end_index 8 to start_index 11) is 2, and the distance between Object_3 and Object_4 (end_index 26 to start_index 29) is also 2, as well as the distance between Object_5 and Object_6 (end_index 44 to start_index 47). As each original object has a size of 1, the size of the new combined objects should be 1 (size of first object) + 1 (size of second object) + 2 (distance between objects) = 4. However, the test output incorrectly lists each new combined object as having a size of 4 instead of the correct size of 4.
