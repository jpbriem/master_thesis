The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.
