For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation rule applies to the largest object in the sequence, moving it exactly 2 positions to the right. Other objects, especially those with a size of 1, are not affected by the transformation.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the largest object in terms of size and move it 2 positions to the right. Leave all other objects, particularly those with a size of 1, in their original positions without any changes to color or size.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the largest object in the input sequence by comparing the size of all objects.', 'Shift the start_index and end_index of the largest object by 2 positions to the right.', 'Ensure that the largest object does not overlap with any other objects after the shift.', 'Keep all other objects, especially those with a size of 1, in their original positions, maintaining their color and size.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
