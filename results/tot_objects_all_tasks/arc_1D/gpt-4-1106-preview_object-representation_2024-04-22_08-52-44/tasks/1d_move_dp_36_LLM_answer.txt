You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change position only if they do not start at index 0. The change is independent of their size or color.
overall pattern: If an object does not start at index 0, it moves to the right by a number of positions equal to the distance from the start index to the nearest multiple of 4 plus 2. Objects that start at index 0 or are of color 9 do not move.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the start_index is not 0 and the color is not 9.', 'If the object meets the condition, calculate the distance (D) from the start_index to the next higher multiple of 4.', 'Add 2 to the distance (D) to determine the total number of positions (N) the object will move to the right.', 'Move the object N positions to the right, ensuring that the size of the object remains the same.', 'Repeat the process for all objects that meet the condition.', 'Maintain the color and size of all objects during the transformation.', 'Objects with a start_index of 0 or color 9 remain unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 15],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 11}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The larger object is always moved to the right by a number of positions equal to the difference between its size and the size of the smaller object, smaller objects remain stationary
overall pattern: Identify the larger object in terms of size. Move this object to the right by the difference in size between the two objects. The smaller object does not change in any way. Apply this transformation regardless of the color of the objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence based on adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Calculate the size of each object by subtracting the starting index from the ending index and adding 1.', 'Determine which object is larger by comparing the sizes of the identified objects.', 'Calculate the difference in size between the larger and smaller object.', 'Move the larger object to the right by as many positions as the size difference calculated in the previous step.', 'Keep the smaller object in its original position.', 'Ensure that the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'Leave any background pixels (represented by 0) unchanged unless they are replaced by the movement of the larger object.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 15],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 15]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

According to the transformation steps, Object_1 should move to the right by the size difference between Object_1 and Object_2, which is 5 - 1 = 4 positions. The test output shows Object_1 starting at index 4, which indicates it has been moved by exactly 4 positions from its original starting index of 0. However, the transformation pattern indicates that the object should be moved by the difference in size, which means Object_1 should start at index 0 + 4(size difference) = 4 and end at index 4 + 4 = 8. This is actually what has occurred in the test output, so it appears that the transformation was correctly applied. Object_2 remains unchanged, which is also correct.

According to the pattern, the larger object (Object_1) should move to the right by the difference in size between the two objects.

After moving to the right by 4 positions, it should start at index 4 and end at index 8, which matches the output. However, the pattern describes that the movement should be equal to the difference in size, which has already been taken into account by ending the object at index 8. Therefore, the start_index of Object_1 should be incremented by 4 as well, resulting in a start_index of 4, but then the end_index should be incremented by the same amount, resulting in an end_index of 8 + 4 = 12.
