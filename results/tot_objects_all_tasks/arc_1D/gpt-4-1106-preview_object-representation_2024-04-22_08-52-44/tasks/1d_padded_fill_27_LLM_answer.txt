You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Merge each pair into a single object, where the new object's start index is that of the first object and the end index is that of the second object. The size of the new object is equal to the distance between the start index of the first object and the end index of the second object plus 1.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are combined into a single object if they are of the same color and have a specific number of indices between them. The specific number of indices between the objects is consistent within each example but varies across examples.
overall pattern: For any given pair of objects of the same color, if there is a consistent gap of n indices between the end_index of the first object and the start_index of the second object, the two objects are combined into a single object that spans from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object. The size of the new object is the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the indices between them.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 66], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 42, 'end_index': 42, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 60, 'end_index': 60, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 64, 'end_index': 64, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 66], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 33, 'end_index': 33, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 52, 'end_index': 52, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 55, 'end_index': 55, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects with the same color and a size of 1 merge if they are separated by a consistent number of background pixels, which is one less than the resulting size after the merge
overall pattern: find pairs of objects with the same color and a size of 1. If they are separated by a number of background pixels that is one less than an odd number k, they merge into a single object spanning their start and end indices with a new size of k



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Check for pairs of objects with the same color and a size of 1.', 'Determine the number of background pixels between each pair of objects.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of objects is one less than an odd number k, proceed with the transformation.', 'Merge the pair of objects into a single object, extending the color from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object.', 'Set the size of the new object to k.', 'Replace the original pair of objects and the intervening background pixels in the sequence with the new merged object.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects with the same color and a size of 1 merge if they are separated by a consistent number of background pixels, which is one less than the resulting size after the merge
overall pattern: find pairs of objects with the same color and a size of 1. If they are separated by a number of background pixels that is one less than an odd number k, they merge into a single object spanning their start and end indices with a new size of k


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Check for pairs of objects with the same color and a size of 1.', 'Determine the number of background pixels between each pair of objects.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of objects is one less than an odd number k, proceed with the transformation.', 'Merge the pair of objects into a single object, extending the color from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object.', 'Set the size of the new object to k.', 'Replace the original pair of objects and the intervening background pixels in the sequence with the new merged object.']

overall pattern:
conditions: objects with the same color and a size of 1 merge if they are separated by a consistent number of background pixels, which is one less than the resulting size after the merge
overall pattern: find pairs of objects with the same color and a size of 1. If they are separated by a number of background pixels that is one less than an odd number k, they merge into a single object spanning their start and end indices with a new size of k


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Check for pairs of objects with the same color and a size of 1.', 'Determine the number of background pixels between each pair of objects.', 'If the number of background pixels between a pair of objects is one less than an odd number k, proceed with the transformation.', 'Merge the pair of objects into a single object, extending the color from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object.', 'Set the size of the new object to k.', 'Replace the original pair of objects and the intervening background pixels in the sequence with the new merged object.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 66],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 40, 'end_index': 40, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 50, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 62, 'end_index': 62, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 66]
transformed objects: [{'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 13}, {'color': 8, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 40, 'size': 13}, {'color': 8, 'start_index': 50, 'end_index': 62, 'size': 13}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation pattern specifies that objects with the same color and a size of 1 should merge if they are separated by a number of background pixels that is one less than an odd number k, resulting in a new size of k. The test input has objects of color 8 at indices 6, 18, 28, 40, 50, and 62. According to the pattern, adjacent objects should merge only if the number of background pixels between them is one less than an odd number k. For the pairs (6, 18), (28, 40), and (50, 62), the number of background pixels between the objects is 11, which is indeed one less than the odd number 13. Therefore, each pair correctly merges into a new object with a size of 13, spanning from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object in each pair. The test output follows the transformation steps accurately and applies the overall pattern correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output seems incorrect based on the overall pattern and the transformation steps described. The overall pattern stipulates that objects with the same color and a size of 1 should merge if they are separated by a number of background pixels that is one less than an odd number k, resulting in a new size of k. In the test case, the objects are separated by the following distances: 11, 9, 11, 9, 11. However, these are not one less than an odd number; they should be even numbers for the merging to result in an odd-sized object as per the pattern. The output objects have sizes of 13, which suggests that the objects should have been separated by 12 pixels, not 11 or 9. Therefore, based on the pattern described, no merging should have occurred, and the output should have consisted of six separate objects of size 1 each. The test output does not reflect the correct application of the transformation steps and does not comply with the overall pattern.",
