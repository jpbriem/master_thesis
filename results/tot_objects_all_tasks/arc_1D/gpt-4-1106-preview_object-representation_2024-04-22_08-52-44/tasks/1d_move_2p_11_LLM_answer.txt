You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 4}

Example_2:

output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 17}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved to the right by an amount that seems to be related to their size. In Example 1, the object moved by an amount equivalent to half of its size. In Example 3, the object moved by its size minus 1. Example 2 does not fit neatly into these rules, suggesting an approximation was made, given the large size of the object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output based only on the input, move each object to the right by an amount related to its size. If the object's size is small, move it by half its size. If the object's size is large, move it by an amount equivalent to half the difference between the total length and the object's size, rounded to the nearest whole number.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 17}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: all objects regardless of color, position, or size move 2 pixels to the right
overall pattern: any single object in the input is moved 2 pixels to the right to produce the output, maintaining its original color and size



transformation steps: ['Identify the single object in the input sequence by locating a sequence of non-zero pixels.', 'Record the color of the object.', 'Calculate the size of the object by counting the number of adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Determine the starting and ending index of the object within the input sequence.', 'Shift the starting and ending index of the object by 2 positions to the right.', 'Create a new output sequence of the same dimension as the input.', 'Fill the new output sequence with 0s up to the new starting index of the object.', 'Fill the next positions in the output sequence with the recorded color of the object, maintaining the same size as the original object.', 'Fill the rest of the output sequence with 0s after the end of the object.', 'Ensure the output sequence dimension remains the same as the input sequence.']

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

input: Dimension: [1, 24],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 20}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 24]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 20}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The input object starts at index 0 and ends at index 19, with a size of 20 and color 5. According to the transformation steps, the object should be shifted 2 pixels to the right. This would place the new starting index at 2 and the new ending index at 21, as the size of the object remains 20. The test output shows the object starting at index 2 and ending at index 21, with the same size of 20 and color 5, which matches the expected result based on the transformation steps. The dimension of the test output also remains the same as the input, which is [1, 24]. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation steps correctly. The object was identified correctly in the input sequence with the color 5 and a size of 20 pixels. The object's starting and ending indices were 0 and 19, respectively. According to the transformation pattern, the object should be moved 2 pixels to the right. After the transformation, the object starts at index 2 and ends at index 21, which is exactly 2 pixels to the right from the original position, maintaining the same color and size. The dimensions of the input and output sequences remain unchanged at [1, 24], which is also correct as per the transformation steps. Therefore, the transformation was applied correctly.", "value": 10}
