The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 17}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The changes do not depend on the color or size of the object. All objects are treated equally regardless of these attributes.\noverall pattern: Any object in the input, regardless of its color or size, is moved 3 places to the right to obtain its output position. The type of object that changes is any object present in the input. The reason for the change is not specified by color, size, or initial position. The change is a consistent shift in position, moving each object 3 places to the right.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify any object present in the input sequence.', 'Move each identified object exactly 3 places to the right.', 'Maintain the original size of each object during the transformation.', 'Keep the color of each object unchanged.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
