You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8]], 'size': 7}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects with a size greater than 1. The rule is consistent regardless of the object's position or the specific colors involved.
overall pattern: For any object with a size greater than 1, swap the first and last colors of the sequence to achieve the output.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects within the sequence that have a size greater than 1.', 'For each identified object, swap the color of the first pixel with the color of the last pixel.', 'Leave the positions of all other colors within each object unchanged.', 'Apply this transformation to all identified objects regardless of their initial position or color.']

output: Dimension: [1, 19], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 2, 2, 2, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6]], 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation applies to objects regardless of their size and position. The condition is that the object must have at least two pixels to swap the colors of the first and last pixels.
overall pattern: For any input object, change the color of the first pixel to the color of the last pixel, and the color of the last pixel to the color of the first pixel, effectively swapping the colors of the first and last pixels of the object.


transformation steps: ['Identify the object within the sequence', 'Check if the identified object has at least two pixels', 'Swap the colors of the first and last pixel of the identified object']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 19],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': [3, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15]], 'size': 5}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 19]
transformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input. Object_1: {'color': [5, 5, 5, 5, 3], 'coordinates': [[0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15]], 'size': 5}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output has followed the transformation steps correctly. The object within the sequence was correctly identified. The object has more than two pixels, meeting the condition for the transformation. The colors of the first and last pixel of the object were successfully swapped from [3, 5, 5, 5, 5] to [5, 5, 5, 5, 3].", "value": 10}
------
{"test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps are followed correctly in the test case. The object within the sequence is identified correctly as Object_1 with the color sequence [3, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The object satisfies the condition of having at least two pixels. The colors of the first and last pixel are then swapped, resulting in the new color sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 3], which matches the expected output based on the overall pattern. The coordinates and size of the object remain unchanged, which is also correct since the transformation only affects colors, not positions or size.", "value": 10}
