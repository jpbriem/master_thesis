The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Only objects with a size other than 1 and 3, and that are not the last object in the sequence, change color. The largest object in the sequence always changes color, except when it is the last object.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify the largest object in the sequence that is not the last object and change its color from 9 to 3. If there are multiple objects tied for the largest size, change the color of all those objects, except the last one, from 9 to 3.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence and identify all objects and their sizes.', 'Determine the largest object size in the sequence, excluding the last object.', 'Identify objects with the determined largest size that are not at the end of the sequence.', 'Change the color of these identified objects from 9 to 3.', 'Leave all other objects, including the last object and any objects with a size of 1 or 3, unchanged.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 31],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_6: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 6}, Object_7: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 2}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 31]\ntransformed objects: [{'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 2}, {'color': 9, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, {'color': 3, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 6}, {'color': 9, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 2}]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output is correct.
