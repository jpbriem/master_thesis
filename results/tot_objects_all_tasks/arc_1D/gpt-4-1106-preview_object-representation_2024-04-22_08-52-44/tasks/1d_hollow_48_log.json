For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 8}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 8}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 10}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects change if their size is greater than 1\noverall pattern: for any object with size greater than 1, create two objects of the same color and size 1 at the positions of the original object's start index and end index\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input sequence whose size is greater than 1.', 'For each identified object, note its color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Remove all pixels belonging to the identified object except for the ones at the start_index and the end_index.', 'Create two new objects of size 1 with the same color as the original object.
