You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

According to the transformation steps, objects larger than size 1 should be moved to the right by the number of background pixels between the object's start_index and the start of the sequence. For Object_1, which starts at index 2, there are 2 background pixels to the left (index 0 and index 1). Therefore, Object_1 should be moved 2 positions to the right, resulting in a new start_index of 4 and an end_index of 8, which matches the test output for Object_1. However, this contradicts the overall pattern described, which states that objects should move to the right by the number of background pixels between the object's start_index and the start of the sequence. In this case, it should be 2 positions, making the correct start_index 2+2=4 and the end_index 6+2=8 for Object_1, which actually matches the test output. Object_2 is of size 1 and should not move, which is indeed reflected correctly in the test output. Upon revisiting the analysis, it appears that the test output for Object_1 is consistent with the overall pattern and transformation steps described.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case input has two objects, where Object_1 is of size 5 and color 3, and Object_2 is of size 1 and color 2. According to the transformation steps, Object_1 should be moved to the right by the number of background pixels before it, which is 2 in this case. The correct starting index after the transformation should be 2 (background pixels) + 2 (original start_index) = 4, which matches the output. However, the end_index should be 4 (new start_index) + 4 (size - 1, as the size is 5) = 8, which also matches the output. Object_2 should remain unchanged because it is of size 1. It correctly remains at indices 10 with color 2. The transformation was applied correctly following the overall pattern and steps provided.",
