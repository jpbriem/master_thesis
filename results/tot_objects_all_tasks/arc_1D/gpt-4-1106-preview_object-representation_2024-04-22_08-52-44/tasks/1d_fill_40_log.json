The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

No change occurs if there is only one object or if the objects have different colors.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify if there are two objects of the same color. If so, merge them into a single object that starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the second object, spanning all intermediate indices inclusively. The size of the new object is the difference between the end_index of the second object and the start_index of the first object plus one.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence that have the same color.', 'Check that the objects are not overlapping and are separated by at least one pixel of the background color.', 'Create a new object with the same color as the two identified objects.', \"Set the 'start_index' of the new object to the 'start_index' of the first object.\", \"Set the 'end_index' of the new object to the 'end_index' of the second object.\", \"Calculate the 'size' of the new object as the difference between the 'end_index' of the second object and the 'start_index' of the first object plus one.\", \"Replace the two original objects in the sequence with the new object, filling all intermediate indices between the 'start_index' and the 'end_index' of the new object with the object's color.\", 'Ensure that all other values in the sequence remain unchanged.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n{\n  \"input_description\": \"regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.

The size of the new object should be the distance from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object, inclusive. In this case, that would be from index 6 to index 23, which is a total of 18 pixels (including both start and end indices).
