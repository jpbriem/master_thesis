You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation occurs when there is a single object present in the input regardless of its color, position, or size
overall pattern: for any single object in the input, create two new objects of the same color at the start and end indexes of the original object with their size reduced to 1



transformation steps: ['Identify the single object in the input sequence by scanning for non-zero pixels grouped together.', 'Record the color of the identified object.', 'Record the start_index and end_index of the identified object.', "Set all pixels of the object in the output sequence to 0, effectively removing the object while preserving the sequence's length.", "Place a pixel of the original object's color at the start_index of the object in the output sequence.", "Place another pixel of the original object's color at the end_index of the object in the output sequence.", 'Ensure that all other pixels in the output sequence remain as the background color, 0.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 11}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 10}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are split based on their start and end indices, reducing their size to 1 at both the start and end, regardless of their original size or color.
overall pattern: For any input object, create two new objects of the same color with a size of 1 at the original start and end indices of the input object.



transformation steps: ['Identify the object within the input sequence by locating the first and last non-zero pixel.', 'Create a new object of the same color at the start index of the original object with a size of 1.', 'Create another new object of the same color at the end index of the original object with a size of 1.', 'Replace all pixels between the new start and end objects with the background color (0).', 'The output sequence should maintain the same dimension as the input sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

conditions: the transformation occurs when there is a single object present in the input regardless of its color, position, or size
overall pattern: for any single object in the input, create two new objects of the same color at the start and end indexes of the original object with their size reduced to 1


transformation steps: ['Identify the single object in the input sequence by scanning for non-zero pixels grouped together.', 'Record the color of the identified object.', 'Record the start_index and end_index of the identified object.', "Set all pixels of the object in the output sequence to 0, effectively removing the object while preserving the sequence's length.", "Place a pixel of the original object's color at the start_index of the object in the output sequence.", "Place another pixel of the original object's color at the end_index of the object in the output sequence.", 'Ensure that all other pixels in the output sequence remain as the background color, 0.']
