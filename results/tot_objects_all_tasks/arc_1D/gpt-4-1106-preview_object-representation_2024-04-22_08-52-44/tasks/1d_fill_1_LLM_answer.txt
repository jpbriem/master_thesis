You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

overall pattern:
conditions: The object changes occur when there are exactly two objects of the same color. The background between them is filled with that color, effectively merging the two objects into one larger object
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify if there are two objects of the same color. If so, extend the first object's size by filling the background between the first and second object with the first object's color, thereby connecting the two objects into one

overall pattern:
conditions: The object changes occur when there are exactly two objects of the same color. The background between them is filled with that color, effectively merging the two objects into one larger object
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify if there are two objects of the same color. If so, extend the first object's size by filling the background between the first and second object with the first object's color, thereby connecting the two objects into one


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Check that both objects have the same color.', 'Determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the second object.', 'Fill all background pixels (color 0) between the two objects with the color of the objects, connecting them into one larger object.', 'Keep the start index of the first object and set the end index to that of the second object, updating the size of the newly formed object accordingly.']

Value Prompt:

system:
#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 8}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 1, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 16}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 20}

overall pattern:
conditions: The object changes occur when there are exactly two objects of the same color. The background between them is filled with that color, effectively merging the two objects into one larger object
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify if there are two objects of the same color. If so, extend the first object's size by filling the background between the first and second object with the first object's color, thereby connecting the two objects into one


transformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Check that both objects have the same color.', 'Determine the start index of the first object and the end index of the second object.', 'Fill all background pixels (color 0) between the two objects with the color of the objects, connecting them into one larger object.', 'Keep the start index of the first object and set the end index to that of the second object, updating the size of the newly formed object accordingly.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 24],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 24]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}
