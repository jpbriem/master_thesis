You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The conditions for transformation are consistent across all examples. Pairs of objects of the same color that are separated by a certain number of background pixels are combined into a single object. The newly formed object spans from the start index of the first object to the end index of the second object in each pair, thus increasing the size by the distance between them plus the size of both objects.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by background pixels. Combine these pairs into single objects by filling the space between them with the same color, thus increasing the size of the objects. The specific number of background pixels between objects that triggers the transformation seems to be consistent within an example but may vary across different inputs.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 47, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 32, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 46, 'end_index': 46, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 49, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 46, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 36, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color that have a consistent number of indices between them are merged into one larger object, where the size of the new object equals the initial size of the individual objects plus the number of indices that separated them in the input
overall pattern: identify objects of the same color that are separated by a consistent gap, sum the sizes of these objects and the consistent gap to define the size of the new object, and merge them into a single object in the output sequence



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each color group, check the distance between adjacent objects.', 'If the distance between objects is consistent, note this as a merging candidate group.', 'For each merging candidate group, calculate the new size of the merged object by adding the sizes of all individual objects and the number of indices that separated them in the input.', 'Create a new object in the output sequence with the color of the merged group, start index of the first object in the group, end index calculated based on the new size, and the new size.', 'Replace individual objects in the merging candidate group with the new merged object in the output sequence.', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 43, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 47, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 43, 'end_index': 47, 'size': 5}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 32, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 46, 'end_index': 46, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 49, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 32, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 46, 'end_index': 49, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 36, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 38, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 51], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 36, 'end_index': 38, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color that have a consistent number of indices between them are merged into one larger object, where the size of the new object equals the initial size of the individual objects plus the number of indices that separated them in the input
overall pattern: identify objects of the same color that are separated by a consistent gap, sum the sizes of these objects and the consistent gap to define the size of the new object, and merge them into a single object in the output sequence


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects.', 'Group objects by their color.', 'Within each color group, check the distance between adjacent objects.', 'If the distance between objects is consistent, note this as a merging candidate group.', 'For each merging candidate group, calculate the new size of the merged object by adding the sizes of all individual objects and the number of indices that separated them in the input.', 'Create a new object in the output sequence with the color of the merged group, start index of the first object in the group, end index calculated based on the new size, and the new size.', 'Replace individual objects in the merging candidate group with the new merged object in the output sequence.', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 51],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 34, 'end_index': 34, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 44, 'end_index': 44, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 51]
transformed objects: [{'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, {'color': 7, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}, {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, {'color': 7, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, {'color': 7, 'start_index': 34, 'end_index': 34, 'size': 1}, {'color': 7, 'start_index': 44, 'end_index': 44, 'size': 1}]

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not reflect the described transformation pattern. No objects have been merged, despite the fact that there are objects of the same color with a consistent gap between them. According to the overall pattern, objects of the same color that have a consistent number of indices between them should be merged into one larger object, and the size of the new object should equal the initial size of the individual objects plus the number of indices that separated them in the input. The test output should have identified the consistent gaps and merged the objects accordingly. Since none of the objects were merged in the test output, the transformation was not applied correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output did not follow the transformation pattern described. According to the overall pattern, objects of the same color that are separated by a consistent gap should be merged into one larger object. However, in the given test output, the objects remain unmerged, and no larger objects have been created even though the input objects are separated by a gap that is consistent for each pair (10-0=10, 27-17=10, 44-34=10). Therefore, based on the described transformation steps, the objects in the test output should have been merged into larger objects with the correct calculated sizes. For instance, Object_1 and Object_2 in the test input should become a single object in the test output with a start index of 0, an end index of 10, and a size equal to the sum of their individual sizes plus the gap size between them. The same should apply to the other pairs of objects (Object_3 and Object_4, Object_5 and Object_6). The test output failed to merge any objects and therefore did not apply the transformation correctly.",
