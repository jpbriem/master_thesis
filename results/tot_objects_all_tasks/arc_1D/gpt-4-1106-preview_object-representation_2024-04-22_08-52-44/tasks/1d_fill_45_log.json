For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 0, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 11}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: objects change if they are of the same color and are separated by background pixels\noverall pattern: for any pair of objects with the same color, remove the background pixels between them, thus creating one larger object that starts at the start index of the first object and ends at the end index of the second object\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Check if there are exactly two objects of the same color.', 'If two objects of the same color are found, note their start and end indices.', 'Remove all background pixels between the two objects.', 'Extend the first object to cover the range from its original start index to the end index of the second object.', 'The color of the extended object remains the same as the original objects.', 'The output sequence should retain the same dimension as the input sequence.', 'Any remaining objects or background pixels are left unchanged in the output sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}.
