For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12]], 'size': 11}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4], 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12]], 'size': 11}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 12}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1], 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 12}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23], [0, 24]], 'size': 14}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 30], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14], [0, 15], [0, 16], [0, 17], [0, 18], [0, 19], [0, 20], [0, 21], [0, 22], [0, 23], [0, 24]], 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation pattern appears to be independent of the object's position and size and purely based on the color of the pixels at the start and end of any given object.\noverall pattern: For any given object in the sequence, swap the colors of the first and last pixels. The rest of the object remains unchanged. This rule applies regardless of the object's size or position within the sequence.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence, defined as a continuous set of non-zero pixels.', 'For each object, swap the color values of the first and last pixel.', 'Retain the color values for all other pixels within the object.', 'Leave all background pixels (denoted by 0) unchanged.', 'Output the transformed sequence maintaining the same dimension as the input.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.
