For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 9}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 8}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 8}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation applies to sequences with two objects where one object is a single-pixel and the other is larger. The single-pixel object's color is exchanged with the larger object's color, and their positions are swapped\noverall pattern: For any input with two objects: Exchange the colors of the single-pixel object and the larger object, then move the single-pixel object to the original starting position of the larger object, and move the larger object to a new position that maintains the same size but is shifted further down the sequence\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the two objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine which object is the single-pixel object and which is the larger object.', 'Exchange the colors of the single-pixel object and the larger object.', 'Move the single-pixel object to the original starting index of the larger object.', 'Calculate the distance between the original starting index of the larger object and the original position of the single-pixel object.', 'Shift the starting and ending index of the larger object down the sequence by the calculated distance.', 'Ensure that the size of the larger object remains the same after the shift.', 'Fill in the background (color 0) where necessary to maintain the dimension of the sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.
