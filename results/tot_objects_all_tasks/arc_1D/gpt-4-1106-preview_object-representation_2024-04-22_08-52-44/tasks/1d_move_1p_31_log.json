The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 20}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 20}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 10}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 10}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 20}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 20}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects move to the right by one position regardless of their color, size, or start_index when they are the only object in the sequence\noverall pattern: For any input with a single object, move the object one position to the right without altering its color or size\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the single object in the input sequence', 'Move the entire object one position to the right within the sequence', 'Maintain the original color of the object', 'Keep the size of the object unchanged', 'If the object starts at index 0, insert a 0 at the start_index to shift the object to the right', 'Ensure the new end_index of the object is one position greater than the original end_index', 'Fill any space left at the original start_index of the object with 0 to represent the background color']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
