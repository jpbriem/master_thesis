The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

The distance can be inferred from the consistent gaps between the objects of the same color in the input sequence.\noverall pattern: For any input, find pairs of objects with the same color separated by a constant distance. Merge each pair into a single object by setting the start_index to that of the first object, the end_index to that of the second object, and the size to include all pixels from the start to the end index. The transformation applies to all such pairs in the input.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Group objects by color.', 'Within each color group, find pairs of objects that are separated by the same constant distance.', 'For each identified pair, set the start_index of the new object to the start_index of the first object in the pair.', 'Set the end_index of the new object to the end_index of the second object in the pair.', 'Calculate the size of the new object by adding all pixels from the start_index to the end_index, inclusive.', 'Replace the object pairs in the input sequence with their corresponding new objects.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 63],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 37, 'end_index': 37, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 45, 'end_index': 45, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 58, 'end_index': 58, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 63]\ntransformed objects: Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.

Each pair of objects has been merged into a single object, with their start_index set to the start_index of the first object in the pair, and the end_index set to the end_index of the second object in the pair. However, the size of each new object seems to have been incorrectly calculated. The size should be the difference between the end_index and the start_index plus one, to include all pixels. For Object_1, the size should be 16 - 3 + 1 = 14, which matches the test output. However, for Object_2 and Object_3, the same calculation should apply: 37 - 24 + 1 = 14 and 58 - 45 + 1 = 14, which also match the test output. Given this consistent application of the transformation rules across all objects, the test output has been correctly transformed from the test input.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output seems to have correctly identified pairs of objects with the same color and merged them according to the overall pattern. In the test input, there are three pairs of objects with color '3' separated by a constant distance of 13 pixels: Object_1 and Object_2, Object_3 and Object_4, Object_5 and Object_6. According to the transformation steps, these pairs should be merged into larger objects. The test output shows that this has been done by setting the start_index of the new objects to that of the first object in each pair and the end_index to that of the second object. The size of each new object is calculated as the distance from the start_index to the end_index plus 1, which should be 14 in each case. The test output matches these expectations, suggesting that the transformation has been applied correctly.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
