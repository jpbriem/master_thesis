The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}.

The object, which originally spanned from index 3 to 5, was correctly shifted to the right by two positions, resulting in a new span from index 5 to 7. The color of the object remained unchanged at 6, and the size of the object also remained unchanged at 3. The transformation steps were followed accurately, with the 'start_index' and 'end_index' of the object incremented by 2. There is no indication that the object's shift has caused it to exceed the boundary of the sequence, so truncation was not necessary. The test output respects the conditions and overall pattern of the provided examples.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output seems to adhere to the transformation steps provided. The input object with color 6 had a start_index of 3 and an end_index of 5. According to the transformation steps, this object should be shifted 2 positions to the right. The output object also has color 6, with a start_index of 5 and an end_index of 7, which is exactly 2 positions to the right of the original positions, and the size remains unchanged at 3. This suggests that the transformation was applied correctly. However, without the actual sequences before and after transformation, we cannot assess if the positions previously occupied by the object were filled with the background color (0), or if the object was truncated correctly if it exceeded sequence limits.
