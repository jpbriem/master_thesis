Step 2: Scaling smaller objects to match this size means adjusting the 'end_index' of Object_2 and Object_3 to match the size of Object_1, which is 3. This should expand Object_2 from 'end_index': 9 to 'end_index': 11 and Object_3 from 'end_index': 15 to 'end_index': 17. Step 3: Moving the start and end indices of scaled objects one position to the left should result in Object_2 having 'start_index': 8 and 'end_index': 10, and Object_3 having 'start_index': 14 and 'end_index': 16. Step 4: Since Object_1 already matches the largest size, no transformation is applied to it. Comparing with the test output, the end_index for Object_2 and Object_3 is correctly transformed, but the end_index for Object_2 and Object_3 should be increased by 2 to match the largest object size before moving one position to the left. The test output does not correctly reflect this, as it shows the end_index of Object_2 and Object_3 as 10 and 16, respectively, instead of 11 and 17 before the left shift.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided test case output against the transformation steps: Step 1 dictates identifying the largest object size, which is 3. Step 2 requires scaling all smaller objects to this size, which seems correctly applied, as both Object_2 and Object_3, originally of size 1, are scaled to size 3. Step 3 demands moving the start_index and end_index of each scaled object one position to the left, which is also correctly applied, as the start_index and end_index for Object_2 and Object_3 are each reduced by 1. Step 4 states that objects which already match the largest size should not be transformed, and Object_1 remains correctly unchanged. Based on the provided pattern and steps, the transformation from the input to the output is accurately applied.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n###########################################################\nNo Valuation - Duplicate candidate"
