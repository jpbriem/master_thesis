The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
