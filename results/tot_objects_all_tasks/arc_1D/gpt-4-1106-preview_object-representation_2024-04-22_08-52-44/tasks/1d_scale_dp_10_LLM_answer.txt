You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

input: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 23], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are expanded to the right, stopping before the last index or before the start of the next object. The color of the objects does not change, and the second object remains unchanged if it is of size 1 and positioned at the end of the sequence.
overall pattern: The first object in the sequence is expanded to the right until it reaches either the second last index of the sequence or the index preceding the second object. The second object remains unchanged if it is a single pixel (size 1) and located at the end of the sequence. This pattern is irrespective of object colors.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the sequence.', "Expand the first object to the right by filling all indices with the object's color up to either the second last index of the sequence or right before the start index of the next object, whichever comes first.", 'Maintain the original color of the first object during the expansion.', 'Check if there is a second object in the sequence.', 'If the second object exists and it is of size 1 and located at the last index of the sequence, leave this object unchanged.', 'Apply the transformation to the sequence to obtain the output.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 23],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 23]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were followed correctly for the given test input. The first object, which is colored 8 and spans from index 1 to 7, was correctly expanded to the right. The transformation expanded Object_1 until index 18, which is right before the start index of Object_2, following the rule that it should stop before the last index or before the start of the next object. Object_2, which is of size 1 and situated at the last index of the sequence, remains unchanged in accordance with the given pattern. The colors of the objects have been maintained as specified. Therefore, the test output adheres to the transformation rules provided.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has correctly applied the transformation steps to the test input. The first object, with a color value of 8, has been expanded from its original size of 7 to a size of 18, stopping just before the second object, which is of size 1 and located at the end of the sequence. This is consistent with the overall pattern where the first object should be expanded to the right up to the second last index or right before the start index of the next object. The second object, with a color value of 7, remains unchanged as specified by the transformation rules, as it is of size 1 and located at the last index of the sequence. The transformation steps were followed correctly, and the test output dimension also matches the input dimension, which is [1, 23].",
