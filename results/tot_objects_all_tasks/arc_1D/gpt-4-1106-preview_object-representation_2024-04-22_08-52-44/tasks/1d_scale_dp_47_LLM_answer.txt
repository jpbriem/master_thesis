You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects:

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object in the sequence changes in size, while the second object remains the same. The increase in size seems to occur until it reaches a certain distance from the second object or the end of the sequence.
overall pattern: For any input, the first object increases in size by expanding towards the second object or the end of the sequence until it is at a minimum distance of 1 pixel from the second object or the end of the sequence. The second object remains unchanged. This pattern seems to be independent of the color of the objects.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 19}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The first object in the sequence changes in size, while the second object remains the same. The increase in size seems to occur until it reaches a certain distance from the second object or the end of the sequence.
overall pattern: For any input, the first object increases in size by expanding towards the second object or the end of the sequence until it is at a minimum distance of 1 pixel from the second object or the end of the sequence. The second object remains unchanged. This pattern seems to be independent of the color of the objects.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object in the input sequence. Record its color, start_index, and end_index.', 'Identify the second object in the input sequence. Record its start_index.', 'Calculate the new end_index for the first object. The new end_index should be the start_index of the second object minus 2, ensuring a minimum distance of 1 pixel from the second object. If there is no second object, the new end_index should be the second to last index of the sequence.', 'Expand the first object to the new end_index calculated in the previous step. This means setting all values between the old end_index and the new end_index to the color of the first object.', 'Keep the second object unchanged.', 'If there are more than two objects, disregard any objects after the second one in the sequence for this transformation pattern.', "Replace the background pixels (0) with the expanded first object's color as necessary to achieve the transformation.", 'Ensure that the output sequence has the same dimension as the input sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}

However, the transformation incorrectly sets the new end_index of Object_1 to 14, which is one pixel short of the expected end_index. The size of Object_1 should have increased from 3 to 5 instead of 4 as given in the test output. Object_2 remains unchanged as expected. The dimension of the output sequence is correct and matches the input sequence dimension.",
