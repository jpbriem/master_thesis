You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change only when they have available space (background pixels) to their right, up to the point of the next object or the end of the sequence. There is no change in color, and the start_index remains the same while the end_index extends to occupy the available space.
overall pattern: For any given object, if there are background pixels to the right and before another object or the sequence end, increase the size of the object by extending the end_index to cover all contiguous background pixels to the right. Do not change the object's color or start_index. Objects that have no space to expand or are immediately followed by another object remain unchanged.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 18}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 19}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand to fill in the background pixels until reaching the position just before the next object. This expansion seems to occur only for the object that precedes another object in the sequence.
overall pattern: The general rule for transforming any input into its output is to expand the size of the first object in the sequence until it reaches one pixel before the start of the next object, filling in all background pixels in between. This expansion occurs while retaining the original color of the object. No changes are made to the subsequent objects in terms of color, position, or size.


transformation steps: ['1. Identify the first object in the sequence that precedes another object.', '2. Determine the start index of the subsequent object.', '3. Expand the size of the identified object to fill in all the background pixels, stopping one pixel before the start index of the subsequent object.', '4. Retain the original color of the object being expanded.', '5. Apply this expansion rule only to the first object that meets the condition of preceding another object.', '6. Leave all subsequent objects unchanged in terms of color, position, or size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

transformation steps: ['Identify all the objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, except for the last one, determine the number of background pixels to the right of it up to the pixel immediately before the next object.', "Expand the size of the object by filling the identified background pixels with the object's color.", 'Repeat the process for each object, except for the last one, in the sequence.', 'Ensure the last object in the sequence remains unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 20],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
