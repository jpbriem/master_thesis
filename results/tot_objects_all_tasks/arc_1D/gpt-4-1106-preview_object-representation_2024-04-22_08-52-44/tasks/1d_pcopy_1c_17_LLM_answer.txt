You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: An object changes if it is a singular pixel, meaning its size is 1.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, examine each object. If an object's size is 1, enlarge it to match the size of the largest object with the same color within the sequence. The start_index of the enlarged object is one less than its original position, and the end_index is one greater, effectively increasing the size of the object by two pixels to match the largest object size.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are smaller than a size of 3 in the input are transformed to a size of 3 in the output. The transformation maintains the original color and starts from the original leftmost pixel of the object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, objects with a size smaller than 3 will be transformed to a size of 3. The leftmost pixel of the object remains in the same position or shifts left if necessary, and the object grows to the right to achieve the size of 3. The color of the object does not change.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 expand to size 3 by adding one pixel of the same color on each side, regardless of the object's color.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: For each object of size 1, increase its size to 3 by adding one pixel of the same color to the start_index and end_index. Do not change objects that already have a size greater than 1.


transformation steps: Identify all objects of size 1. For each identified object, add one pixel of the same color before the start_index and one pixel of the same color after the end_index. The resulting object will have a size of 3. Do not modify objects with a size greater than 1.


Test case:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are smaller than a size of 3 in the input are transformed to a size of 3 in the output. The transformation maintains the original color and starts from the original leftmost pixel of the object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, objects with a size smaller than 3 will be transformed to a size of 3. The leftmost pixel of the object remains in the same position or shifts left if necessary, and the object grows to the right to achieve the size of 3. The color of the object does not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input sequence with a size smaller than 3.', 'For each identified object, calculate the number of pixels needed to reach a size of 3.', 'Starting from the leftmost pixel of the object, extend the object to the right by the calculated number of pixels.', 'If the object is already at the end of the sequence and cannot extend to the right, shift the object to the left just enough to allow for growth to the right, ensuring the object reaches the size of 3.', 'Maintain the original color of the object during the transformation.', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged.']

transformation steps: Identify all objects of size 1. For each identified object, add one pixel of the same color before the start_index and one pixel of the same color after the end_index. The resulting object will have a size of 3. Do not modify objects with a size greater than 1.

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects that are smaller than a size of 3 in the input are transformed to a size of 3 in the output. The transformation maintains the original color and starts from the original leftmost pixel of the object.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, objects with a size smaller than 3 will be transformed to a size of 3. The leftmost pixel of the object remains in the same position or shifts left if necessary, and the object grows to the right to achieve the size of 3. The color of the object does not change.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects in the input sequence with a size smaller than 3.', 'For each identified object, calculate the number of pixels needed to reach a size of 3.', 'Starting from the leftmost pixel of the object, extend the object to the right by the calculated number of pixels.', 'If the object is already at the end of the sequence and cannot extend to the right, shift the object to the left just enough to allow for growth to the right, ensuring the object reaches the size of 3.', 'Maintain the original color of the object during the transformation.', 'Leave all other objects and background pixels unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.
