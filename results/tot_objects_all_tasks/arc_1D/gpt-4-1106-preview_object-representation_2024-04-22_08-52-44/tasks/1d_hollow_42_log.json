The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

According to the overall pattern, since the object had a size greater than 1, it was split into two new objects of the same color and size 1. The first new object was placed at the start_index of the original object, and the second new object was placed at the end_index of the original object. The input sequence had one object of color 4, starting at index 1 and ending at index 6 with a size of 6, which is greater than 1. The transformation steps were followed correctly to produce two new objects of color 4 and size 1 at indices 1 and 6, as seen in the test output. The output sequence maintains the correct dimension, and the transformation was applied correctly.\", \"value\": 10}\n------\n{\"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output seems to follow the transformation pattern correctly. The input object has a size greater than 1, which triggers the transformation. Step 1 retains the color of the original object, which is 4. Step 2 and 3 correctly create two new objects with the same color and size 1 at the original object's start_index and end_index, respectively. Step 4 then replaces the original object with these two new objects. The original object with color 4, starting at index 1 and ending at index 6 of size 6, has been correctly transformed into two objects of color 4 of size 1 at the start_index 1 and end_index 6. There are no objects with a size of 1 in the input that would remain unchanged according to step 5. Therefore, based on the provided examples and transformation steps, the test output has been correctly transformed from the test input.\", \"value\": 10}"
