You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 4}

Example_2:

overall pattern:
conditions: Object color changes based on the object's index in the sequence; odd indices change to color 1, even indices change to color 7. The positions and sizes of the objects do not change.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, change the color of each object based on its index. Odd indexed objects change to color 1, even indexed objects change to color 7. Keep the position and size of each object unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence and determine its index within the sequence.', 'For each odd-indexed object (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), change its color to 1.', 'For each even-indexed object (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), change its color to 7.', 'Maintain the original start and end indices for each object.', 'Maintain the original size for each object.', 'Output the sequence with the transformed object colors, ensuring that the position and size of each object are preserved.']


Test case:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.

overall pattern: To transform any input into its output: change the color of odd-positioned objects to 1 and even-positioned objects to 7. Retain the original size and position of all objects


transformation steps: ['Identify all distinct objects in the input sequence.', 'Assign a position number to each object starting from 1 for the first object.', 'For each object, check if its position number is odd or even.', "If an object's position number is odd, change its color to 1.", "If an object's position number is even, change its color to 7.", 'Retain the original size and position of all objects.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the updated colors for each object.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 3}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 21]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 6}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 3}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test case output has followed the transformation steps correctly. Each object has been identified, their positions have been correctly assigned as Object_1 being in the first position, Object_2 in the second position, and Object_3 in the third position. According to the overall pattern, odd-positioned objects should change to color 1 and even-positioned objects to color 7. The transformed objects reflect this rule accurately with Object_1 and Object_3 (both in odd positions) having their colors changed to 1, and Object_2 (in the second, even position) having its color changed to 7. The sizes and positions of all objects have been retained correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test input consists of three objects, all initially with color 2. According to the overall pattern, the first object should change its color to 1 since it is in an odd position (position 1). The second object should change its color to 7 as it is in an even position (position 2). The third object should change its color to 1, being in another odd position (position 3). The test output correctly reflects this transformation pattern, with Object_1's color changed to 1, Object_2's color changed to 7, and Object_3's color changed to 1. The sizes and positions of the objects have been retained, as per the transformation steps. The test output matches the expected output based on the transformation rules provided.",
