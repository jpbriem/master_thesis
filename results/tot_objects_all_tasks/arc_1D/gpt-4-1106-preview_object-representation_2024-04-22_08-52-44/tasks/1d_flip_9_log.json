The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 8}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8], 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 8}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9]], 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2], 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 9]], 'size': 7}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'coordinates': [[0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 6}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4], 'coordinates': [[0, 9], [0, 10], [0, 11], [0, 12], [0, 13], [0, 14]], 'size': 6}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation is consistent across all examples: the sequence of colors within each object is reversed.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, reverse the sequence of colors for each object. The object's size and position remain unchanged, and the number of objects also remains the same.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify each object in the input sequence by finding sequences of adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Reverse the color sequence within each object while keeping its original position fixed.', 'Apply the color reversal transformation to every object identified in the input sequence.', 'Ensure the output sequence maintains the same dimension as the input sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
