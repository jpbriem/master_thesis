You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move right by a number of positions if they are not already at the start or end of the sequence. The number of positions moved seems to be related to the size or position of the object.
overall pattern: Objects that are not at the start or end of the sequence move right by a number of positions determined by a specific rule, possibly involving their size or relative position. The color and size of the objects remain the same during this transformation.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'For each object, calculate the number of positions to move right by taking half the size of the object and rounding down.', 'Move each object to the right by the calculated number of positions without altering its color or size.', 'If an object is already at the start or end of the sequence, it does not move.', 'Maintain the relative order of objects if there are multiple objects.', 'Fill any gaps created by moving objects with the background color (0).', 'Ensure that the object does not move beyond the end of the sequence. If the calculated move would place the object beyond the end, it should be placed as far right as possible without changing the size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 22],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: The change seems to be related to the movement of the first object by a certain number of positions to the right while the second object remains the same, serving likely as a reference point
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, move the first object to the right by a number of positions equal to the difference between the start index of the first object and the index of the second object minus one, without changing its color or size. The second object remains unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify the first and second objects in the input sequence.', 'Calculate the distance to move the first object by taking the start index of the second object and subtracting the start index of the first object, then subtract one more from this result.', 'Move the first object to the right by the calculated distance, ensuring that its size and color remain the same.', 'Leave the second object in its original position, without any changes to its size, color, or position.', 'Fill the original position of the first object with background color (0) up to the new start index of the first object after it has been moved.', 'If there are any other objects present in the input, apply the same logic of maintaining their size, color, and relative positions unless specified otherwise by additional conditions.']


Test case:

  "test_output_analysis": "The test input sequence has two objects. According to the transformation steps, object sizes are used to calculate the number of positions they should move to the right. Object_1 has a size of 14, which means it should move 14 / 2 = 7 (rounded down) positions to the right. Starting at index 4 and moving 7 positions to the right, Object_1 should start at index 11 and end at index 24. However, since the sequence is only 22 indices long, Object_1 should instead be placed starting at index 8 and ending at index 21 to avoid extending beyond the sequence. Object_2 is already at the end of the sequence and should not move. The test output correctly places Object_1 starting at index 8 and ending at index 21. Object_2 remains at index 21, which is also correct. However, since Object_1 ends at index 21, it overlaps with Object_2, which should not happen. The error here is that Object_2 should be moved to index 22 to avoid the overlap, but since the dimension is only 22, Object_2 should actually be discarded as there is no space for it after Object_1.",

    "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were not followed correctly for the test input. The size of Object_1 is 14, so according to the transformation steps, it should move to the right by half its size, which is 7 positions (rounded down from 7.5). However, the object starts at index 4, so moving it 7 positions to the right would place it starting at index 11, not 8 as indicated in the test output. Accordingly, the end index should be 17 + 7 = 24, which is beyond the sequence limit, so Object_1 should be placed as far right as possible without changing the size, starting at index 22 - 14 = 8 and ending at index 21. Object_2 should not move since it is already at the end of the sequence. The test output incorrectly states that Object_1 starts at index 8, while it should start at index 8 given the correct transformation, but the end index in the test output matches the constrained end position of 21.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects move right by a number of positions if they are not already at the start or end of the sequence. The number of positions moved seems to be related to the size or position of the object.
overall pattern: Objects that are not at the start or end of the sequence move right by a number of positions determined by a specific rule, possibly involving their size or relative position. The color and size of the objects remain the same during this transformation.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the size of each object.', 'For each object, calculate the number of positions to move right by taking half the size of the object and rounding down.', 'Move each object to the right by the calculated number of positions without altering its color or size.', 'If an object is already at the start or end of the sequence, it does not move.', 'Maintain the relative order of objects if there are multiple objects.', 'Fill any gaps created by moving objects with the background color (0).', 'Ensure that the object does not move beyond the end of the sequence. If the calculated move would place the object beyond the end, it should be placed as far right as possible without changing the size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 22],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}

However, the transformed Object_1 also overlaps with Object_2, which should not happen because the objects must maintain their relative order and cannot occupy the same position. The overlap indicates an error in the transformation process. Object_2 is at the end of the sequence and should not move, which is correctly represented in the test output.",
