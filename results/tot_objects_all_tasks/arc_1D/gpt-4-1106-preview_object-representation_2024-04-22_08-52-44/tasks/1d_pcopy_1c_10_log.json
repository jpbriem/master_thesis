The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

Objects with a size greater than 1 remain unchanged in the output.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, objects with a size of 1 are identified and scaled to a size of 3, maintaining their original color and starting position shifted one pixel to the left if possible. Objects that are already larger than size 1 are left unchanged. The transformation applies regardless of the object's color or position.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions accurately refer to the input and are relevant for determining the object changes, as they specify the transformation of objects based on size.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern correctly describes the transformation from input to output for this example, where single pixel objects are expanded to size 3, and larger objects remain unchanged.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as long as the new input follows the same object size criteria.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions are consistent with the input and necessary for understanding how objects are transformed in the output, specifically regarding the scaling of objects of size 1.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern describes the transformation accurately for this example as well, with single pixel objects being expanded and multi-pixel objects retained as is.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern is sufficiently precise for transforming new inputs, provided they adhere to the same rules regarding object sizes.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The conditions again correctly refer to the input, outlining the changes required for single pixel objects, which is key to the transformation process.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern holds true for this example, indicating a consistent method of scaling up single pixel objects while preserving the larger ones.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The pattern maintains its precision for this example, allowing for accurate prediction of outputs from new inputs that follow the same pattern.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.

Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.
