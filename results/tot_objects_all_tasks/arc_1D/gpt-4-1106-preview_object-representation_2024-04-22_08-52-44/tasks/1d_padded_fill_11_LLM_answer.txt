You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

overall pattern:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color are merged if they are separated by other object(s) or background pixels following a specific equidistant pattern
overall pattern: identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by an equidistant pattern. Merge these pairs into a single object that starts at the index of the first and ends at the index of the second object, increasing their size accordingly. This pattern ignores any objects that do not fit the equidistant separation requirement.



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify all objects.', 'For each object, check if there is a subsequent object of the same color.', 'Determine the distance between the current object and the next object of the same color.', 'If the distances between subsequent objects of the same color are equal, consider them as pairs for merging.', 'For each pair, change the end index of the first object to match the end index of the second object and update the size to reflect the new range.', 'Remove the second object from the sequence after it has been merged with the first.', 'Repeat the steps for all objects in the sequence.', 'Leave any non-paired objects untouched.', 'The output sequence should reflect the merged objects while preserving the original color and incorporating the new sizes.']

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge into a larger object if they are separated by a specific number of empty spaces. The size of the merged object is determined by the start index of the first object and the end index of the second object
overall pattern: two objects of the same color will merge if the number of empty spaces between them is one less than their final size in the output. The output object starts at the start index of the first input object and ends at the end index of the second input object



transformation steps: ['Iterate through the input sequence to identify all objects, defined as adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Initialize an empty list to hold the transformed objects.', 'For each object in the input sequence, identify if there is a subsequent object of the same color.', 'If a subsequent object of the same color is found, measure the distance in empty spaces between the current object and the subsequent object.', 'If the distance in empty spaces is exactly one less than the predetermined final size of the merged object as per the output, merge the two objects.', 'The merged object will have the start index equal to the start index of the first object and the end index equal to the end index of the second object, with the color unchanged.', 'The size of the merged object will be the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the number of empty spaces between them.', 'Add the merged object to the list of transformed objects.', 'If the object cannot be merged (no subsequent object of the same color or the distance does not meet the condition), it remains unchanged and is added to the list of transformed objects.', 'Continue this process until all objects in the input sequence have been considered.', 'Construct the output sequence by placing the transformed objects back into a sequence using their start and end indices, filling the spaces in between with their color, and leaving all other spaces as the background color (0).']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern: identify pairs of objects with the same color that are separated by an equidistant pattern. Merge these pairs into a single object that starts at the index of the first and ends at the index of the second object, increasing their size accordingly. This pattern ignores any objects that do not fit the equidistant separation requirement.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of the same color merge into a larger object if they are separated by a specific number of empty spaces. The size of the merged object is determined by the start index of the first object and the end index of the second object
overall pattern: two objects of the same color will merge if the number of empty spaces between them is one less than their final size in the output. The output object starts at the start index of the first input object and ends at the end index of the second input object


transformation steps: ['Iterate through the input sequence to identify all objects, defined as adjacent pixels of the same color.', 'Initialize an empty list to hold the transformed objects.', 'For each object in the input sequence, identify if there is a subsequent object of the same color.', 'If a subsequent object of the same color is found, measure the distance in empty spaces between the current object and the subsequent object.', 'If the distance in empty spaces is exactly one less than the predetermined final size of the merged object as per the output, merge the two objects.', 'The merged object will have the start index equal to the start index of the first object and the end index equal to the end index of the second object, with the color unchanged.', 'The size of the merged object will be the sum of the sizes of the two original objects plus the number of empty spaces between them.', 'Add the merged object to the list of transformed objects.', 'If the object cannot be merged (no subsequent object of the same color or the distance does not meet the condition), it remains unchanged and is added to the list of transformed objects.', 'Continue this process until all objects in the input sequence have been considered.', 'Construct the output sequence by placing the transformed objects back into a sequence using their start and end indices, filling the spaces in between with their color, and leaving all other spaces as the background color (0).']
