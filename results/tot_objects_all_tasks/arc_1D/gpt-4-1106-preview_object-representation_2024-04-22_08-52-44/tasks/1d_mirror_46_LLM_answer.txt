You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects swap colors and move to the right; each object moves by the size of the other object
overall pattern: For any input, objects swap their colors and positions are shifted to the right by the size of the other object. Object_1 moves to the right by the size of Object_2, and Object_2 moves to the right by the size of Object_1


transformation steps: ['Identify Object_1 and Object_2 in the input sequence.', 'Record the size of Object_1 and the size of Object_2.', 'Swap the colors of Object_1 and Object_2.', 'Move Object_1 to the right by a distance equal to the size of Object_2.', 'Move Object_2 to the right by a distance equal to the size of Object_1.', 'Ensure that the objects are separated by at least one background pixel after the move.', 'Maintain the original sizes of Object_1 and Object_2 after the transformation.', 'Fill any gaps left by the movement of objects with the background color.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 14],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 14]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}

Value Outputs:
{
    "test_output_analysis": "The transformation appears incorrect. According to the overall pattern and transformation steps, Object_1 with color 4 should move to the right by the size of Object_2, which is 1, and Object_2 with color 9 should move to the right by the size of Object_1, which is 3. Thus, the expected positions for Object_1 should start at index 7 and end at index 9, while Object_2 should start at index 11 and end at index 11. However, the provided test output has Object_1 starting at index 9 and ending at index 11, and Object_2 starting and ending at index 12. Furthermore, the objects are not separated by at least one background pixel, violating the transformation rules. The colors are correctly swapped, but the positions are not correctly adjusted according to the transformation steps.",

------
{
    "test_output_analysis": "The test output does not follow the specified transformation pattern correctly. According to the pattern, Object_1 (color 4, size 3) should move to the right by the size of Object_2 (size 1), and Object_2 (color 9, size 1) should move to the right by the size of Object_1 (size 3). However, in the test output, Object_1 has moved to the right by one position (from index 6 to index 9) instead of just by the size of Object_2, which is one position. Object_2 has moved to the right by four positions (from index 8 to index 12), instead of by the size of Object_1, which is three positions. Additionally, Object_1 and Object_2 should swap colors, which has been done correctly. However, since the movement of the objects is not following the pattern, the test output is incorrect.",
