You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 14}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 15}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 15}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}
output: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 14}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects, irrespective of their color or size, shift their positions by 2 places to the right
overall pattern: For any input, shift the position of each object by 2 places to the right while maintaining their color and size


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence.', 'For each object, determine its current start_index and end_index.', 'Shift the start_index of each object by 2 places to the right.', 'Shift the end_index of each object by 2 places to the right.', 'Ensure that the color of each object remains unchanged during the shift.', 'Ensure that the size of each object remains unchanged during the shift.', 'Fill the two positions to the left of the new start_index of each object with the background color (0).', 'If the shift causes any object to exceed the boundary of the sequence, truncate the object to fit within the dimension.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 25],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 16}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 25]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 16}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output has correctly identified the input object and applied the transformation pattern. The input object with color 8 starts at index 5 and ends at index 20, with a size of 16. According to the overall pattern, this object should be shifted 2 places to the right. The test output shows the object now starts at index 7 and ends at index 22, maintaining the same size of 16 and the same color 8. This indicates the input object was correctly shifted by 2 places to the right without changing its size or color. The transformation steps have been followed accurately for this test case. The background color (0) is assumed to fill the positions to the left of the new start_index as per step 7, and since the object does not exceed the boundary of the sequence, there is no need for truncation as per step 8.",
  "value": 10
}
------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation instructions correctly. Each step of the transformation is adhered to: the object is identified correctly with its color, start index, end index, and size. The object's start and end indices are both shifted by 2 places to the right without altering the object's color or size. The new start_index is 7 and the new end_index is 22, which correctly represents a shift of 2 places to the right from the original start_index of 5 and end_index of 20. The size remains 16, which is consistent with the object's original size. The output also respects the boundary condition as the end_index of 22 does not exceed the sequence boundary of 24 (zero-indexed). The two positions to the left of the new start_index have been correctly filled with the background color (0), as per the instructions.",
