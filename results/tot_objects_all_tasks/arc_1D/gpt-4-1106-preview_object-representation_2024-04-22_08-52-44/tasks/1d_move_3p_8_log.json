The size and color of objects remain unchanged. The initial position influences the transformation.\noverall pattern: The type of object that changes is any object present. The reason for the change is the transformation rule applied consistently across examples. The change is a rightward shift of the object's position by three places regardless of its size or color.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the object within the input sequence by locating a non-zero series of pixels.', 'Record the color and size of the object.', 'Calculate the new start index for the object by adding 3 to the original start index.', 'Calculate the new end index for the object by adding 3 to the original end index.', 'Ensure that the new indices do not exceed the dimension of the input sequence.', 'Create a new output sequence with the same dimension as the input sequence, initialized with zeros (background color).', 'Place the object in the output sequence at the new indices, using the same color and size as in the input sequence.', 'Fill any remaining positions with zeros (background color) if necessary.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
