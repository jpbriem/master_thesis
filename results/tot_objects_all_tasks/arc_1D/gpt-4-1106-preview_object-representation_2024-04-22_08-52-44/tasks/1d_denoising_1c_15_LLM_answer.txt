You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color; remove all but the largest object of that color. Keep the largest object with its original color, position, and size.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all distinct objects, noting their color, position, and size.', 'Group objects by color.', 'Within each color group, compare the sizes of the objects to determine the largest object.', 'Remove all objects of the same color except for the largest one identified in the previous step.', 'Leave the largest object of each color unchanged in terms of color, position, and size.', 'Output the transformed sequence with only the largest objects of each color retained.']

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 12}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are removed if there is a larger object of the same color present in the sequence. Only the largest object of a particular color is kept, regardless of its position.
overall pattern: Identify objects of the same color; remove all but the largest object of that color. Keep the largest object with its original color, position, and size.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all distinct objects, noting their color, position, and size.', 'Group objects by color.', 'Within each color group, compare the sizes of the objects to determine the largest object.', 'Remove all objects of the same color except for the largest one identified in the previous step.', 'Leave the largest object of each color unchanged in terms of color, position, and size.', 'Output the transformed sequence with only the largest objects of each color retained.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 11}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 11}

Value Outputs:
{"test_output_analysis": "The test output correctly follows the overall pattern and transformation steps. The input had multiple objects of color 2, with the largest one being Object_2 with a size of 11. According to the transformation pattern, only the largest object of a particular color should be kept. The transformation steps were correctly applied: (1) All objects were identified along with their colors, positions, and sizes. (2) Objects were grouped by their color. (3) Within the group of color 2, the sizes of the objects were compared. (4) All objects of color 2 except for the largest one, Object_2, were removed. (5) The largest object, Object_2, was left unchanged in terms of color, position, and size. (6) The output sequence was correctly transformed to include only Object_2, which is the largest object of color 2. Therefore, the test output is accurate.", "value": 10}

{"test_output_analysis": "To evaluate the test output, we must follow the transformation steps and check if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output. The test input has objects with the same color, which means we need to identify the largest object of that color and remove the rest. According to the transformation pattern, 'only the largest object of a particular color is kept, regardless of its position'. The test input contains six objects, all of the color 2, with the sizes 1, 11, 1, 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Based on the size, the second object (Object_2) is the largest object of color 2. Therefore, all other objects of color 2 should be removed from the sequence. The test output shows only the largest object (Object_1 in the output, which corresponds to Object_2 in the input) with the correct color, start index, end index, and size. Since the transformation steps were correctly applied and the test output reflects the removal of all objects except for the largest one of the same color, the test output is accurate and follows the transformation pattern correctly.", "value": 10}
