For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects of size 1 change, regardless of color or initial position\noverall pattern: Objects of size 1 are scaled to size 3 and moved one position towards the start of the sequence. Object color and position (except for the shift) remain unchanged. Objects larger than size 1 remain the same\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check if the size is equal to 1.', 'If the object size is 1, scale the object to size 3 by repeating its color value two more times.', 'Move the scaled object one position towards the start of the sequence by updating the start and end indices to be one less than the original start index and one more than the original end index.', 'Leave objects with size greater than 1 unchanged, retaining their original color, start index, end index, and size.', 'Output the transformed sequence with all objects in their new positions and sizes.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
