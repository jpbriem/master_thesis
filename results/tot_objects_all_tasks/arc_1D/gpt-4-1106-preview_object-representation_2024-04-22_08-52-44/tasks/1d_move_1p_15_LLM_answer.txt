You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 12], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: All objects change by moving one position to the right regardless of their color, size, or initial position.
overall pattern: For any input, move each object exactly one position to the right within the same dimension. The type of object that changes is any object present. It changes position by moving to the right, and the change occurs without altering the color or size of the object.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', "For each object, increase the 'start_index' and 'end_index' by 1.", 'Ensure the object does not exceed the dimension of the sequence after the move.', "If moving an object would cause it to exceed the sequence's dimension, do not move the object.", 'Maintain the color and size of each object during the transformation.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 12],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 5}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 12]

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change position by shifting one index to the right regardless of their initial position, color, and size.
overall pattern: All objects are shifted one position to the right. The type of object does not change, the reason for the change is consistent across all inputs, and the method is a simple positional shift.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, move the start_index and end_index one position to the right.', 'Maintain the color and size of each object.', 'If the object is at the end of the sequence, ensure the sequence is appropriately extended to accommodate the shift.', 'Replace the original object with the background color (0) where the object was initially positioned before the shift.', 'Insert the object in the new position with the same color and size.']
