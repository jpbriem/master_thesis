You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 24}

overall pattern:
conditions: when there are multiple objects of the same color, they are merged into a single object
overall pattern: identify objects of the same color and merge them into one object starting at the start index of the first object and ending at the end index of the last object, regardless of their initial size or the distance between them



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input sequence.', 'Check for objects with the same color that are separated by background pixels.', 'Create a new object starting at the start_index of the first object of the matching color.', 'Extend the new object to the end_index of the last object of the matching color.', 'Assign the color of the original objects to the newly created object.', 'Remove the original objects from the sequence.', 'Fill the positions between the new start_index and end_index with the color of the objects.', 'Ensure that the dimension of the output sequence remains the same as the input sequence.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer. Return 0 if no test output was given.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 22}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 24}

overall pattern:
conditions: the transformation occurs if there are exactly two objects with the same color
overall pattern: for any two objects of the same color, merge them into one object that starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the second object, with the size being the distance between the start_index of the first object and the end_index of the second object inclusive


transformation steps: ['Identify the first object with its start_index and color', 'Identify the second object with the same color', 'Create a new object with the same color that starts at the start_index of the first object and ends at the end_index of the second object', 'The size of the new object is the distance from the start_index of the first object to the end_index of the second object inclusive', 'Replace the two original objects with the newly created object in the output sequence', 'Ensure that all other pixels in the output sequence remain as the background color']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 29]
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 25}

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation pattern observed in the examples and applies the detailed transformation steps correctly. The test input had two objects of the same color (color: 4), Object_1 starting at index 2 and Object_2 starting at index 26. The transformation steps require to merge these two objects into a single object that starts at the start index of Object_1 and ends at the end index of Object_2, with the size being the inclusive distance between these indices. The test output shows a single object of color 4 that starts at index 2 and ends at index 26, with a size of 25. This is the correct transformation, as the distance from index 2 to 26 is indeed 25 pixels (inclusive). All other pixels are assumed to remain as the background color, which follows the last transformation step. Therefore, the test output is correct and should receive a high rating.",

------
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output follows the transformation steps correctly. The input sequence has two objects of the same color (4), which meets the condition for the transformation. The first object has a start_index of 2, and the second object, also of color 4, has an end_index of 26. Following the overall pattern, these two objects should be merged into a single object that starts at the start index of the first object (2) and ends at the end index of the second object (26). The size of the new object should be the inclusive distance between these indices, which is 26 - 2 + 1 = 25. The output correctly lists one object with color 4, a start_index of 2, an end_index of 26, and a size of 25. All other pixels in the output sequence are correctly maintained as the background color.",
