The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Any object of size 1 changes in size to 3. No changes occur for objects of size other than 1.\noverall pattern: For any object of size 1, increase its size to 3 by adding one pixel of the same color before its start index and one after its end index.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
