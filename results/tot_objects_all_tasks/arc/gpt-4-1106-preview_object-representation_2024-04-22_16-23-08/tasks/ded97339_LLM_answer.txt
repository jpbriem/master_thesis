You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand in specific patterns depending on their initial positions relative to the grid walls. Expansion occurs until a connection is made with another object or until a specific boundary is reached.
overall pattern: The object closest to the top wall expands downwards to connect with the object closest to the bottom wall. The object closest to the left wall expands rightwards to connect with the object closest to the right wall. If an object is closest to the top-left corner, it expands in a clockwise spiral until it reaches the object closest to the right wall. Expansion makes the original objects become part of the newly formed object. Objects that do not meet these conditions remain the same.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand vertically or horizontally to connect with the nearest object in the same row or column.

An object stops expanding once it has connected to another object.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with the same color. Then, for each object, expand it horizontally and vertically until it connects with another object in the same row or column. If multiple objects are in the same row or column, connect to all, forming a cross shape before proceeding to other objects. Absorb smaller objects that are connected by a larger object. The expansion stops once a connection is made.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern: identify the top-leftmost object; if it is in line with another object, expand towards it until connection; if not, expand in a clockwise spiral; absorb any objects connected during expansion; other objects not in line or the spiral path remain unchanged

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand towards the nearest object in line with them, either horizontally or vertically; expansion continues until they connect with another object or reach the grid edge; objects that are connected are absorbed; the top-leftmost object expands in a clockwise spiral if no objects are in line with it
overall pattern: identify the top-leftmost object; if it is in line with another object, expand towards it until connection; if not, expand in a clockwise spiral; absorb any objects connected during expansion; other objects not in line or the spiral path remain unchanged

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 6]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[7, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[9, 6]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 6], [7, 6], [8, 6], [9, 6]], 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[7, 4]], 'size': 1}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 7]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[6, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[6, 9]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[8, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 7]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2], [6, 2], [7, 2], [8, 2]], 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[6, 5], [6, 6], [6, 7], [6, 8], [6, 9]], 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[4, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[7, 5]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[7, 9]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[9, 2]], 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2], [3, 1], [1, 3], [4, 1], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 5], [7, 5], [7, 6], [7, 7], [7, 8], [7, 9]], 'size': 18}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[9, 2]], 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of the same color expand and absorb other objects based on their position. The leftmost object expands horizontally to the right, and the topmost object expands vertically downwards
overall pattern: Identify the leftmost and topmost objects of the same color. The leftmost object expands horizontally to the right until it reaches another object of the same color, absorbing it. The topmost object expands vertically downwards until it reaches another object of the same color, absorbing it. Continue this process until no more objects of the same color can be absorbed


transformation steps: ['Identify the leftmost object of the target color. This object will expand horizontally to the right.', 'Identify the topmost object of the target color. This object will expand vertically downwards.', 'The leftmost object expands to the right, absorbing other objects of the same color that are horizontally aligned with it.', 'The topmost object expands downwards, absorbing other objects of the same color that are vertically aligned with it.', 'Repeat the expansion process until no more objects can be absorbed.', 'Ensure expansions are only within the grid bounds and do not overlap with expansions from other objects unless they are being absorbed.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [10, 10],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 7]], 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[5, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[8, 4]], 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[8, 7]], 'size': 1}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects expand towards the nearest object in line with them, either horizontally or vertically; expansion continues until they connect with another object or reach the grid edge; objects that are connected are absorbed; the top-leftmost object expands in a clockwise spiral if no objects are in line with it
overall pattern: identify the top-leftmost object; if it is in line with another object, expand towards it until connection; if not, expand in a clockwise spiral; absorb any objects connected during expansion; other objects not in line or the spiral path remain unchanged


transformation steps: ['Identify the top-leftmost object in the grid.', 'Check if it is in line horizontally or vertically with any other object.', 'If it is in line, expand towards the nearest object in the same line until they connect.', 'Continue the expansion until reaching the grid edge or connecting with another object.', 'If the top-leftmost object is not in line with any object, begin expansion in a clockwise spiral shape.', 'Absorb any objects that are connected during the expansion.', 'Objects that are not in line with the expansion path or within the spiral remain unchanged.']

The expansion correctly covers all the edge pixels in a clockwise fashion and stops at [2, 1], which is the starting point of the spiral, thus forming a border of color '8' around the grid. However, the output contains a mistake. After the spiral expansion, Object_4 at coordinates [5, 1] should have been absorbed by the expanding spiral, but it is still listed as unchanged in the transformed objects.

Instead, the output shows the spiral continues past Object_2 and covers the entire perimeter of the grid, which is incorrect because the expansion should stop upon connecting with another object. Additionally, Object_2, Object_3, Object_4, Object_5, and Object_6 remain unchanged in the output, which is correct only if they were not in the path of the spiral expansion.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

In the output, the object has expanded downward correctly until [1, 7] but also incorrectly to the left. Object_5 at [8, 4] is shown correctly expanding to the right until [8, 7], but it should not be absorbing Object_6 at [8, 7] because it is not the topmost object and hence should not expand vertically. Instead, Object_6 should remain as a single pixel. The size of the transformed objects also seems incorrect, as the expansions have not been properly accounted for. Object_1 should have a larger size than reported due to the correct downward expansion, and Object_5 should have a smaller size as it should not have expanded vertically.",

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output seems to have errors. According to the transformation steps, we should first identify the leftmost and topmost objects of the target color. The leftmost object is Object_1 at [1, 1], and the topmost object is also Object_1 at [1, 1]. Object_1 should expand horizontally right and vertically downward. Object_1 correctly expanded horizontally to the right edge and absorbed Object_3. However, it incorrectly absorbed Object_4, Object_5, and Object_6, which is not aligned horizontally with it. The vertical expansion of Object_1 is missing; it should have expanded downward to absorb Object_2 and Object_4, creating a block of 8s in the first column. Object_2 expanded horizontally but should not have, as it is not the leftmost object. Object_4 should not have expanded horizontally to the right because it was supposed to be absorbed by Object_1's vertical expansion. Object_5 and Object_6 should not have expanded at all as they should have been absorbed by Object_1's horizontal expansion.",

{
    "test_output_analysis": "The test output has multiple issues. Firstly, the output shows separate expansions for Object_1, Object_2, Object_4, Object_5, and Object_6. According to the transformation steps, Object_1 should expand horizontally right and absorb Object_2, Object_3, and partially Object_4, since it is the leftmost object. Object_5 and Object_6 should not expand horizontally as they are not the leftmost objects. Object_1 should also expand vertically downwards and absorb Object_4 completely, as it is the topmost object. The output incorrectly expands Object_2, Object_4, and Object_6 horizontally, and it incorrectly expands Object_4 vertically without being absorbed by Object_1. Moreover, Object_1 should not expand all the way to [9, 9], as the expansion should stop at the first absorbed object's last coordinate in each direction. Object_5's single coordinate expansion is correct as it does not have any objects to absorb vertically or horizontally. The output does not match the specified transformation pattern.",
