The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\n\nYour task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]], 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [3, 3], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]], 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [3, 3], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1]], 'size': 1}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'size': 3}\noutput: Dimension: [5, 5], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: All objects change in a consistent manner. The color changes to 2 and the position is shifted down by one row, regardless of the initial position, color, or size.\noverall pattern: For any input, change the color of all objects to 2, and shift their position one row downwards. The size of the objects remains unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects within the input grid.', 'For each object, change its color value to 2.', 'Shift the position of each object one row downwards within the grid dimensions.', 'Keep the size and shape of each object unchanged.', 'Any object part that would move outside the grid as a result of the shift is removed.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [5, 5],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 1]], 'size': 4}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [5, 5]\ntransformed objects: [Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2], [2, 1]], 'size': 4}]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The provided transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. The object's color is changed to 2, which is consistent with the pattern described. The object's position is shifted down one row, and the grid dimensions remain the same. There is no indication that any part of the object would move outside the grid, so no part is removed. The size and shape of the object are unchanged, as required. The transformation steps have been followed accurately.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test input grid has an object with color 8 and coordinates at [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 1]]. According to the transformation steps, this object should have its color changed to 2, and all its coordinates should be shifted down by one row. The expected output object should therefore have its coordinates at [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2], [2, 1]]. This is exactly the output provided in the test case output, with the object maintaining its size of 4 pixels. The transformation steps were correctly followed, and the test output grid is a correct transformation of the test input grid.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
