The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

For Object_2, the original color was 2, which has been correctly changed to 1, and the object has been expanded correctly to a 3x3 square around the original pixel. The coordinates are correct, and the size is 8. For Object_3, the original color was 8, which has been correctly changed to 4, and the object has been expanded correctly to a 3x3 square around the original pixel. The coordinates are correct, and the size is 8. All original single-pixel objects (Object_4, Object_5, Object_6) have been left unchanged in the correct positions with the correct colors, following the transformation steps. The error with the coordinates for Object_1 affects the correctness of the transformation process.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The transformation steps were not applied correctly in several aspects. Firstly, the coordinates for the expansion of Object_1 are incorrect, as the new square should have been centered around the original pixel's coordinates ([1, 1]), but the output shows it centered around [0, 0]. Similarly, for Object_2, the output is centered around [10, 13] correctly, but the new color should be 1 based on the transformation pattern, and the original pixel should remain with color 2, which it does. However, the size of the new object is incorrect, as it should be 8 and cover a 3x3 square, but the coordinates listed miss the top row and left column, making the actual size only 6. For Object_3, the transformation is applied correctly with the square centered around [14, 2] and the color changed to 4, but again, the size is incorrectly listed as 8 due to the missing top row and left column in the provided coordinates.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\nMoreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
