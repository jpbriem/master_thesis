You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change based on their initial size. If the size is 8, the object undergoes a transformation.
overall pattern: For objects with a size of 8, change the color to 2 and reduce the size to 5 by forming a cross shape. The center of the cross is at the center of the original object's bounding box. Objects with sizes other than 8 remain unchanged.

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their size is 8. The transformation involves changing the color from 1 to 2 and reducing the shape to a plus sign, centered in the middle of the original shape, resulting in a size of 5.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with a size of 8. Change these objects' color to 2 and reshape them into a plus sign centered at their original center. Leave all other objects unchanged.



transformation steps: ['Identify objects with size 8.', 'Change the color of these objects from 1 to 2.', "Determine the center of the original shape. This can be calculated as the average of the row and column indices of the object's pixels.", 'From the center, form a new object in the shape of a plus sign, with one central pixel, and one pixel extending up, down, left, and right from the center.', 'Replace the original object with the new plus sign object in the output grid.', 'Keep all other objects with size different from 8 unchanged in the output grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2]], 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 7], [2, 7], [3, 7], [2, 6], [2, 8]], 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1], [6, 1], [5, 0], [5, 2]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[6, 4], [7, 4], [8, 4], [7, 3], [7, 5]], 'size': 5}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 8], [7, 9]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [0, 5], [2, 4], [0, 6], [2, 5], [1, 6], [2, 6]], 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 8], [4, 8], [5, 8], [4, 7], [4, 9]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 1], [6, 1], [5, 2], [7, 1], [5, 3], [7, 2], [6, 3], [7, 3]], 'size': 8}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 6], [8, 6], [8, 7], [8, 8]], 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [1, 4], [1, 6]], 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 8], [4, 8], [5, 8], [4, 7], [4, 9]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 2], [6, 2], [7, 2], [6, 1], [6, 3]], 'size': 5}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 6], [8, 6], [8, 7], [8, 8]], 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their size is 8. The transformation involves changing the color from 1 to 2 and reducing the shape to a plus sign, centered in the middle of the original shape, resulting in a size of 5.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with a size of 8. Change these objects' color to 2 and reshape them into a plus sign centered at their original center. Leave all other objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with size 8.', 'Change the color of these objects from 1 to 2.', "Determine the center of the original shape. This can be calculated as the average of the row and column indices of the object's pixels.", 'From the center, form a new object in the shape of a plus sign, with one central pixel, and one pixel extending up, down, left, and right from the center.', 'Replace the original object with the new plus sign object in the output grid.', 'Keep all other objects with size different from 8 unchanged in the output grid.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [10, 10],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 8], [1, 8], [2, 8], [1, 7], [1, 9]], 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [2, 2], [4, 1], [2, 3], [4, 2], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 8}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[6, 6], [6, 7]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 1], [8, 1], [7, 2], [9, 1], [7, 3], [9, 2], [8, 3], [9, 3]], 'size': 8}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[8, 8], [9, 8], [8, 9], [9, 9]], 'size': 4}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]"'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [2, 0], [0, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 7], [2, 7], [3, 7], [2, 6], [2, 8]], 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1], [6, 1], [5, 0], [5, 2]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[6, 3], [7, 3], [6, 4], [8, 3], [6, 5], [8, 4], [7, 5], [8, 5]], 'size': 8}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 8], [7, 9]], 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2]], 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 7], [2, 7], [3, 7], [2, 6], [2, 8]], 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[4, 1], [5, 1], [6, 1], [5, 0], [5, 2]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[6, 4], [7, 4], [8, 4], [7, 3], [7, 5]], 'size': 5}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 8], [7, 9]], 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [0, 5], [2, 4], [0, 6], [2, 5], [1, 6], [2, 6]], 'size': 8}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 8], [4, 8], [5, 8], [4, 7], [4, 9]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[5, 1], [6, 1], [5, 2], [7, 1], [5, 3], [7, 2], [6, 3], [7, 3]], 'size': 8}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 6], [8, 6], [8, 7], [8, 8]], 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [10, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [1, 4], [1, 6]], 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[3, 8], [4, 8], [5, 8], [4, 7], [4, 9]], 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[5, 2], [6, 2], [7, 2], [6, 1], [6, 3]], 'size': 5}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 6], [8, 6], [8, 7], [8, 8]], 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects with size 8 change; they are transformed into cross shapes of size 5 with a new color, centered at their original center
overall pattern: for any input, objects with size 8 are transformed into a cross shape of size 5, color is changed to 2, and the shape is centered at the original center of the object. No other objects change.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with size 8.', 'Calculate the center of the identified objects by averaging the row and column indices of their coordinates.', 'Change the color of the identified objects to 2.', 'Transform the identified objects into a cross shape of size 5 centered at the calculated center coordinates. The cross shape consists of one center pixel and four additional pixels, one in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the center.', 'Leave all other objects unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [10, 10],  Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[0, 8], [1, 8], [2, 8], [1, 7], [1, 9]], 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[2, 1], [3, 1], [2, 2], [4, 1], [2, 3], [4, 2], [3, 3], [4, 3]], 'size': 8}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[6, 6], [6, 7]], 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 1], [8, 1], [7, 2], [9, 1], [7, 3], [9, 2], [8, 3], [9, 3]], 'size': 8}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[8, 8], [9, 8], [8, 9], [9, 9]], 'size': 4}

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change when their size is 8. The transformation involves changing the color from 1 to 2 and reducing the shape to a plus sign, centered in the middle of the original shape, resulting in a size of 5.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, identify objects with a size of 8. Change these objects' color to 2 and reshape them into a plus sign centered at their original center. Leave all other objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Identify objects with size 8.', 'Change the color of these objects from 1 to 2.', "Determine the center of the original shape. This can be calculated as the average of the row and column indices of the object's pixels.", 'From the center, form a new object in the shape of a plus sign, with one central pixel, and one pixel extending up, down, left, and right from the center.', 'Replace the original object with the new plus sign object in the output grid.', 'Keep all other objects with size different from 8 unchanged in the output grid.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.

Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Value Outputs:
{
  "test_output_analysis": "The test output grid analysis shows that the transformation steps were correctly applied to the test input grid. The overall pattern dictates that objects with a size of 8 should be transformed into cross shapes of size 5 with a new color, centered at their original center. In the test case, Object_2 and Object_4 meet these criteria. After transformation, these objects have indeed changed to a cross shape of size 5 with a color change to 2, and they are centered at the original center of the objects. The remaining objects (Object_1, Object_3, and Object_5), which do not meet the size condition, remain unchanged, which is consistent with the transformation steps. Based on this analysis, the transformation steps were applied correctly.",

{
  "test_output_analysis": "The transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Two objects of size 8 (Object_2 and Object_4) were identified. Their centers were calculated correctly, which are (3,2) for Object_2 and (8,2) for Object_4. The color of these objects was changed to 2, and they were both transformed into a cross shape of size 5, centered at the calculated center coordinates. The other objects remained unchanged as per the overall pattern.",
