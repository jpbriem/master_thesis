The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [13, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3], [3, 2], [2, 3], [1, 4], [4, 2], [3, 3], [2, 4], [1, 5], [5, 2], [4, 3], [3, 4], [2, 5], [1, 6], [6, 2], [5, 3], [4, 4], [3, 5], [2, 6], [6, 3], [5, 4], [4, 5], [3, 6], [6, 4], [5, 5], [4, 6], [6, 5], [5, 6], [6, 6]], 'size': 30}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 10], [2, 10], [1, 11], [3, 10], [2, 11], [1, 12], [3, 11], [2, 12], [3, 12]], 'size': 9}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[8, 8], [9, 8], [8, 9], [10, 8], [9, 9], [8, 10], [11, 8], [10, 9], [9, 10], [8, 11], [12, 8], [11, 9], [10, 10], [9, 11], [8, 12], [12, 9], [11, 10], [10, 11], [9, 12], [8, 13], [12, 10], [11, 11], [10, 12], [9, 13], [8, 14], [12, 11], [11, 12], [10, 13], [9, 14], [12, 12], [11, 13], [10, 14], [12, 13], [11, 14], [12, 14]], 'size': 35}\noutput: Dimension: [13, 15], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3], [3, 2], [1, 4], [4, 2], [1, 5], [5, 2], [1, 6], [6, 2], [2, 6], [6, 3], [3, 6], [6, 4], [4, 6], [6, 5], [5, 6], [6, 6]], 'size': 18}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[1, 10], [2, 10], [1, 11], [3, 10], [1, 12], [3, 11], [2, 12], [3, 12]], 'size': 8}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 3], [3, 3], [2, 4], [4, 3], [3, 4], [2, 5], [5, 3], [4, 4], [3, 5], [5, 4], [4, 5], [5, 5]], 'size': 12}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 11]], 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[8, 8], [9, 8], [8, 9], [10, 8], [8, 10], [11, 8], [8, 11], [12, 8], [8, 12], [12, 9], [8, 13], [12, 10], [8, 14], [12, 11], [9, 14], [12, 12], [10, 14], [12, 13], [11, 14], [12, 14]], 'size': 20}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[9, 9], [10, 9], [9, 10], [11, 9], [10, 10], [9, 11], [11, 10], [10, 11], [9, 12], [11, 11], [10, 12], [9, 13], [11, 12], [10, 13], [11, 13]], 'size': 15}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [12, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2], [3, 1], [2, 2], [1, 3], [4, 1], [3, 2], [2, 3], [1, 4], [4, 2], [3, 3], [2, 4], [4, 3], [3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 2], [8, 2], [7, 3], [9, 2], [8, 3], [7, 4], [9, 3], [8, 4], [7, 5], [9, 4], [8, 5], [7, 6], [9, 5], [8, 6], [7, 7], [9, 6], [8, 7], [9, 7]], 'size': 18}\noutput: Dimension: [12, 11], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2], [3, 1], [1, 3], [4, 1], [1, 4], [4, 2], [2, 4], [4, 3], [3, 4], [4, 4]], 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 2], [3, 2], [2, 3], [3, 3]], 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[7, 2], [8, 2], [7, 3], [9, 2], [7, 4], [9, 3], [7, 5], [9, 4], [7, 6], [9, 5], [7, 7], [9, 6], [8, 7], [9, 7]], 'size': 14}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[8, 3], [8, 4], [8, 5], [8, 6]], 'size': 4}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [12, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 6], [2, 6], [1, 7], [3, 6], [2, 7], [1, 8], [4, 6], [3, 7], [2, 8], [1, 9], [5, 6], [4, 7], [3, 8], [2, 9], [6, 6], [5, 7], [4, 8], [3, 9], [6, 7], [5, 8], [4, 9], [6, 8], [5, 9], [6, 9]], 'size': 24}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [2, 1], [4, 0], [3, 1], [2, 2], [5, 0], [4, 1], [3, 2], [2, 3], [5, 1], [4, 2], [3, 3], [5, 2], [4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 16}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[8, 2], [9, 2], [8, 3], [10, 2], [9, 3], [8, 4], [11, 2], [10, 3], [9, 4], [8, 5], [11, 3], [10, 4], [9, 5], [8, 6], [11, 4], [10, 5], [9, 6], [8, 7], [11, 5], [10, 6], [9, 7], [8, 8], [11, 6], [10, 7], [9, 8], [8, 9], [11, 7], [10, 8], [9, 9], [11, 8], [10, 9], [11, 9]], 'size': 32}\noutput: Dimension: [12, 13], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'coordinates': [[1, 6], [2, 6], [1, 7], [3, 6], [1, 8], [4, 6], [1, 9], [5, 6], [2, 9], [6, 6], [3, 9], [6, 7], [4, 9], [6, 8], [5, 9], [6, 9]], 'size': 16}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[2, 0], [3, 0], [2, 1], [4, 0], [2, 2], [5, 0], [2, 3], [5, 1], [3, 3], [5, 2], [4, 3], [5, 3]], 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[2, 7], [3, 7], [2, 8], [4, 7], [3, 8], [5, 7], [4, 8], [5, 8]], 'size': 8}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[3, 1], [4, 1], [3, 2], [4, 2]], 'size': 4}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'coordinates': [[8, 2], [9, 2], [8, 3], [10, 2], [8, 4], [11, 2], [8, 5], [11, 3], [8, 6], [11, 4], [8, 7], [11, 5], [8, 8], [11, 6], [8, 9], [11, 7], [9, 9], [11, 8], [10, 9], [11, 9]], 'size': 20}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'coordinates': [[9, 3], [10, 3], [9, 4], [10, 4], [9, 5], [10, 5], [9, 6], [10, 6], [9, 7], [10, 7], [9, 8], [10, 8]], 'size': 12}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation pattern involves removing interior points from square-shaped objects, leaving only the perimeter, and removing the central column from rectangular-shaped objects. When the interior is removed from squares, the color changes to 8, and new objects are created from the removed points with color 8. The number of objects may increase due to the creation of these new objects.\noverall pattern: For any input, to transform a square object, remove all interior points, change the color to 8, and leave only the perimeter points. For a rectangular object, remove the central column of points. Create new objects with color 8 from the removed points. The size of an object is the number of remaining points after the transformation.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify square-shaped objects and rectangular-shaped objects in the input grid.', 'For square-shaped objects, remove all interior points, leaving only the perimeter.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors. Objects can not overlap!', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output grid [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe all objects after transformation for the test output grid by following the format in the test case input: : \"[Object_ID: {\\'color\\': \\'object color\\', \\'coordinates\\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \\'size\\': \\'number of pixels\\'}, ...]\"'}}.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.\n\nNext to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_case_input_objects': 'copy the objects of the test case input grid from the task', 'transformation': 'Describe in natural language how the transformed objects should look like in the test output grid, be specific and state new object sizes, coordinates, colors.

The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive.

For each object in the input grid, the perimeter pixels have been retained, while the inner pixels have been removed. Diagonal border pixels have been correctly changed to color 8, forming new separate objects as specified in the overall pattern. However, there are a few discrepancies that need to be addressed: Object_1 in the test output should have its diagonal pixels at coordinates [[1,2], [2,3]] changed to color 8, and Object_2 should have the pixel at coordinate [[2,9]] changed to color 8. Moreover, Object_4's size is reported as 17, which does not match the count of coordinates listed (16 coordinates). This suggests a counting error. Object_5 and Object_6 have been created correctly according to the pattern, with the inner 2x2 squares turned into new objects of color 8. The reported sizes for the objects (except for the counting error in Object_4) match the number of coordinates, which is consistent with the pattern of only keeping the perimeter of the objects.\",\n  \"value\": 7\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output grid seems to have been transformed according to the described pattern with some discrepancies. The pattern requires that for each object, only the perimeter pixels should be retained. Diagonal border pixels should change color to 8, and central squares or cross shapes within objects should become new objects with color 8. In the test output, Object_1, Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4 appear to have been correctly reduced to their perimeter pixels. However, there is an issue with Object_1 and Object_3 where the central pixels have not been changed to color 8. For Object_1, the pixel at coordinates [2,3] should have been changed to color 8. For Object_3, the central cross composed of pixels at coordinates [[6,4], [7,3], [7,4], [7,5], [8,4]] should have been transformed into color 8. Object_4 has been correctly reduced to perimeter pixels, but there are some missing pixels in the output; for example, the pixel at coordinates [9,9] is missing.

Object_7, which is a new object of color 8, was correctly separated in the middle of Object_3 as per the pattern for square or cross shapes. Object_8 is also correctly identified as a new object of color 8 from Object_4. Yet, there are mistakes in the coordinates and sizes of the objects, such as missing pixels that should have been included in the perimeters and inaccurately counted sizes.

Similarly, Object_2 is correctly reduced to its perimeter. Object_3's transformation is partly correct, but there are missing pixels on the perimeter such as [6,3], [7,4], and [8,5] and extra pixels like [10,3], [10,4], [10,5], [10,6] that should not be there. Object_4's perimeter is retained correctly, but it includes extra pixels such as [13,10] and [13,11] which should not be present. Object_5 and Object_6 appear to be new objects with color 8 created from the central cross shapes of Object_1 and Object_2, respectively, which is in line with the overall pattern. However, there's an error with Object_5, as the coordinates [2,2] and [1,3] do not form part of a cross shape. Object_7's pixels are correctly transformed into color 8 as they form a central square within Object_3, but it contains too many pixels; it should only include the central square, not the entire cross shape. Object_8 is a new object of color 8 created from the central cross shape of Object_4, which is correct.

Object_1 is a square-shaped object and should have its interior points removed and the perimeter's color changed to 8. Object_2 is a smaller square-shaped object and should also have its interior removed with the perimeter's color changed to 8. Object_3 is a larger square-shaped object and should follow the same process. Object_4 is a rectangular object which should have the central column of points removed. The size of each object should reflect the number of remaining points after transformation. The test output grid for Object_1 shows the correct perimeter left with the color changed to 8, but the size is incorrect. The output size should be 10, not 12. Object_2 has been incorrectly transformed; the color has not been changed to 8, and too many points have been removed. The size should be 6, with the color 8, not 1. Object_3's transformation seems to be incorrect as well; the size is larger than the expected perimeter, and additional points have been included that do not form a perimeter. Object_4's transformation is correct in terms of the removal of the central column, but the size does not match the expected outcome as the number of points is 20 instead of 18. Object_5 and Object_6 are new objects from the removed interior points and should be color 8, yet Object_6 has too many points for a single column of a square. Object_7, Object_8, and Object_9 are new objects created from the removed points of Object_3 and Object_4, but their sizes seem inconsistent with the expected results of the transformation pattern.

The correct transformation should involve removing the interior of square-shaped objects, leaving only the perimeter, and changing the color to 8. For rectangular-shaped objects, the central column should be removed. However, in the test output, the transformation does not consistently follow these rules. For example, Object_1's output includes coordinates that should have been removed as they are not part of the perimeter. Also, Object_2's output should not contain coordinates [[2,10],[3,9]] since they should have been removed as part of the central column. Object_3's output also contains interior squares that should have been removed and turned into Object_8 as new objects with color 8. Furthermore, Object_4's transformation results in incorrect coordinates and sizes, as some central points remain, and the size of the object does not reflect the removal of points. There are also discrepancies in the number of objects created with color 8 and their respective sizes. Object_5, Object_6, and Object_7 seem to be created from interior points removed from other objects, but the sizes and coordinates do not align with the expected results of the transformation steps. Object_9's output contains coordinates that should have been part of the perimeter of Object_4, suggesting an incorrect transformation.

In the test output, Object_1, which is a square, has been transformed into a rectangle with color 8, but its size is not correct as the total perimeter points should be 16 (4 points on each side), not 13. Object_2, also a square, has been correctly transformed into color 8 but the size again is not correct; it should have 12 perimeter points instead of 8. Object_3, a rectangle, has been partially transformed correctly with the central column removed. However, the color should remain the same, and a new object with color 8 should have been created from the removed points. This has not been done. Object_4 is a rectangle and has been transformed correctly with its central column removed. But again, there should be a new object with color 8 created from the removed points, which is missing.
