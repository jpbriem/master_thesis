Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The overall pattern seems to involve conditions related to the color, size, and position of the objects. Specifically, the transformation involves retaining the largest object of a certain color and potentially shifting its position.\noverall pattern: The general rule for the transformation involves retaining the largest object of a certain color and potentially shifting its position based on conditions related to color, size, and position.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence', 'For each unique color in the input sequence, find the largest object of that color based on size', 'Select the largest object of each color and retain it in the output sequence', \"If the largest object's position needs to be shifted based on specific conditions related to color, size, and position, then adjust its start and end indices accordingly\"]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The overall pattern seems to involve conditions related to the color, size, and position of the objects. Specifically, the transformation involves retaining the largest object of a certain color and potentially shifting its position.\noverall pattern: The general rule for the transformation involves retaining the largest object of a certain color and potentially shifting its position based on conditions related to color, size, and position.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence', 'For each unique color in the input sequence, find the largest object of that color based on size', 'Select the largest object of each color and retain it in the output sequence', \"If the largest object's position needs to be shifted based on specific conditions related to color, size, and position, then adjust its start and end indices accordingly\"]\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 12}\ntest case output dimension: [1, 33]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 9\n}"
