The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input, based on object colors, positions, and sizes, that determine the changes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The overall condition for the change in color seems to be based on the original color of the object. When the original color is 1, it remains unchanged, but when the original color is 2, it changes to 1.\noverall pattern: The transformation pattern involves changing the color of objects from 1 to 2 and vice versa, while keeping the position and size unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object, check its original color.', 'If the original color is 1, change it to 2; if the original color is 2, change it to 1.', 'Output the transformed sequence with the updated colors and unchanged positions and sizes of the objects.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}\noutput:\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}\ntest case output dimension: [1, 17]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
