For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The overall condition for object transformation seems to be based on the color and size of the objects, where objects with specific color and size may remain unchanged or shift positions in the sequence\noverall pattern: Objects with specific color and size may remain unchanged, while others may shift positions in the sequence. The start and end index of the objects may remain the same during the transformation\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence based on their color and size.', 'For each identified object, check if it matches the specific color and size that remain unchanged according to the overall pattern.', 'If an object matches the unchanged criteria, keep its start and end index the same in the output sequence.', 'If an object does not match the unchanged criteria, shift its position in the output sequence based on the overall pattern.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
