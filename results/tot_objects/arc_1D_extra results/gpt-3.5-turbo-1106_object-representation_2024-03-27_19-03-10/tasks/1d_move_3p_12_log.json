For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 14}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 15}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 25], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 25], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The position of each object changes by adding 3 to both the start_index and end_index values\noverall pattern: The position of objects in the input sequence changes by adding 3 to both the start_index and end_index values\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence', 'For each object, add 3 to the start_index and end_index values', 'Generate the output sequence using the modified object positions']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"
