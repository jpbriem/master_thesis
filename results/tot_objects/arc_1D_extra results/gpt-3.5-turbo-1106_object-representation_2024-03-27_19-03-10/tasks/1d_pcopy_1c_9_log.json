For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects change based on the condition that if there is an object of the same color adjacent to it, then its position and size are adjusted accordingly.\noverall pattern: Objects of the same color adjust their position and size if they are adjacent to each other in the input sequence.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify all objects of the same color that are adjacent to each other in the input sequence.', 'For each group of adjacent objects of the same color, adjust their position and size to form a continuous sequence of objects in the output.', 'Update the start and end indices of the objects based on their adjacency in the input sequence, ensuring that they form continuous sequences in the output.', 'Adjust the size of the objects to match the continuous sequence formed in the output.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
