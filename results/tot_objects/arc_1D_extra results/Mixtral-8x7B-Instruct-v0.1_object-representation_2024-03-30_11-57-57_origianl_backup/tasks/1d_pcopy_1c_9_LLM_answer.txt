#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Analyzing all three examples, we can observe that the position and size of objects change based on their color and initial position. Specifically, objects seem to move to positions that are multiples of their size minus or plus one, depending on whether their initial position fulfills that condition. Additionally, some objects may have their size altered.
overall pattern: For each object, check its color and initial position. If its initial position is a multiple of its size plus or minus one, adjust its position accordingly. Also, examine if the object s size needs to be adjusted based on its color and position.

2. If an object is surrounded by empty spaces with no objects nearby, it will stay the same.
3. If an object encounters another object with the same color ahead (to its right) or behind (to its left), it will expand symmetrically toward the encountered object, possibly overwriting it.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The overall pattern suggests that the main condition determining the changes in the position and size of objects depends on their initial size. Specifically, when the size of an object is less than the maximum possible value, the object shifts one unit to the left. Additionally, when the size of an object is exactly 1, the size increases by a factor of 3, and the object shifts two units to the right.
overall pattern: To summarize, we can define the following rules:<br>* If the size of an object is smaller than the maximum possible value, the object shifts one unit to the left.<br>* If the size of an object is exactly 1, its size increases by a factor of 3, and it shifts two units to the right.<br><b>Note:</b> These rules apply regardless of the objects color. Also, since the number of objects does not change during the transformation, the position adjustments will not lead to collisions between adjacent objects.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The overall pattern suggests that the main condition determining the changes in the position and size of objects depends on their initial size. Specifically, when the size of an object is less than the maximum possible value, the object shifts one unit to the left. Additionally, when the size of an object is exactly 1, the size increases by a factor of 3, and the object shifts two units to the right.
overall pattern: To summarize, we can define the following rules:<br>* If the size of an object is smaller than the maximum possible value, the object shifts one unit to the left.<br>* If the size of an object is exactly 1, its size increases by a factor of 3, and it shifts two units to the right.<br><b>Note:</b> These rules apply regardless of the objects color. Also, since the number of objects does not change during the transformation, the position adjustments will not lead to collisions between adjacent objects.


transformation steps: [{'step': 'Check if the size of each object is smaller than the maximum possible value (i.e., the length of the input sequence).', 'operation': 'check_object_size'}, {'step': 'If the size of an object is smaller than the maximum possible value, shift the object one unit to the left.', 'operation': 'shift_left'}, {'step': 'Identify the objects with a size of exactly 1.', 'operation': 'filter_objects_by_size'}, {'step': 'Increase the size of the identified objects by a factor of 3.', 'operation': 'increase_object_size'}, {'step': 'Shift the enlarged objects two units to the right.', 'operation': 'shift_right'}]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, we can identify that object starting indices decrease systematically by two units, suggesting some form of positional adjustment applied consistently across the entire sequence. There does not appear to be any correlation between these changes and object colors or sizes.
overall pattern: To generate an output given an input, systematically reduce each object's starting index by two units, preserving the same size and color for each object throughout the transformation process.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: The overall pattern suggests that the main condition determining the changes in the position and size of objects depends on their initial size. Specifically, when the size of an object is less than the maximum possible value, the object shifts one unit to the left. Additionally, when the size of an object is exactly 1, the size increases by a factor of 3, and the object shifts two units to the right.
overall pattern: To summarize, we can define the following rules:<br>* If the size of an object is smaller than the maximum possible value, the object shifts one unit to the left.<br>* If the size of an object is exactly 1, its size increases by a factor of 3, and it shifts two units to the right.<br><b>Note:</b> These rules apply regardless of the objects color. Also, since the number of objects does not change during the transformation, the position adjustments will not lead to collisions between adjacent objects.

Explanation:

* Step 1: The algorithm iterates through each object in the input sequence. In the test case, there are two objects.
* Step 1.1: The algorithm retrieves the current object's properties - color, start\_index, end\_index, and size. This is done for both objects.
* Step 2: The algorithm performs the required positional adjustment on the object's start\_index, decreasing it by two units. For Object_1, the start\_index becomes 1-2 = -1; however, since index cannot be negative, it wraps around and starts from the last index (in this case, 32) which results in 32-1 = 31. Similarly, for Object_2, the start\_index becomes 6-2 = 4.
* Step 3: The algorithm recalculates the end\_index based on the updated start\_index and size. For Object_1, the new end\_index is 31 + 3 = 34, but due to the wrapping behavior, it ends up being 1 (as it reaches the beginning of the array). For Object_2, the end\_index becomes 4+1=5.
* Steps 4 & 5: The algorithm preserves the object's color unchanged and updates the object metadata (including the new start\_index, end\_index, and preserved color). These changes reflect the expected test output provided in the question.
* Step 6: Finally, the algorithm outputs the transformed sequence represented as `transformed objects` above, matching the test case output dimension and transformed objects mentioned. Based on this analysis, the test output appears to be correct and would receive a score of 10 out of 10.

Analysis:

1. Step 1: The test output contains the correct number of objects, indicating proper iteration through the input sequence.
2. Step 1.1: The retrieval of properties seems accurate since both objects maintain their respective colors and sizes.
3. Step 2: This step is where issues arise; instead of reducing the start\_index by two units, the test output has negative start\_indices, which is incorrect.
	* Object_1: Correct old start\_index = 1, new start\_index = -1 (-2 would be expected)
	* Object_2: No change needed (correctly adjusted to positive index)
4. Steps 2.1 & 3.1: These steps depend on the calculation from Step 2, so they cannot be accurately evaluated without addressing the previous issue.
5. Step 4: Color preservation appears to be correct in the test output.
6. Step 5: With the exception of the first object's start\_index, updating the metadata appears correct.
7. Due to the error in calculating new start\_indices, the test output receives a rating of 7 out of 10.
------
 {
  "test_output_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions:",
  "value": 7
}

Explanation:

1. Step 1: Iterate through each object in the input sequence.
   - The test output contains the correct number of objects, so this step appears to be performed correctly.

2. Step 2: Perform the required positional adjustment on the object's `start_index`, decreasing it by two units.
   - In the test output, both objects have their `start_index` decreased by two units, so this step is performed correctly.

3. Step 3: Recalculate the `end_index` based on the updated `start_index` and size.
   - In the test output, the `end_index` values seem incorrectly adjusted. For instance, the first object has a `size` of 3, but its `end_index` is now 2 instead of 4. This indicates an error in recalculating the `end_index`.

4. Step 4: Preserve the object's color unchanged during this transformation process.
   - Based on the provided information, there are no issues regarding preserving the colors. All objects maintain their initial color values.

5. Step 5: Update the object metadata using the newly calculated `start_index`, `end_index`, and preserved color.
   - Since updating object metadata depends on accurate calculations of `start_index` and `end_index`, the issue identified in step 3 impacts this step.

6. Step 6: Output the transformed sequence.
   - Transformed objects presented in the test output show inconsistent `end_index` values, making the whole transformation incorrect.

Given the discrepancies found, I would rate the test output 7 out of 10 points due to accurately performing most parts of the instruction except calculating and updating the `end_index` values.

transformation steps: ['Step 1: Iterate through each object in the input sequence.', "1.1: Retrieve the current object's properties (color, start_index, end_index, and size).", "Step 2: Perform the required positional adjustment on the object's start_index, decreasing it by two units.", '2.1: Calculate the new start_index value by subtracting two from the original start_index value.', 'Step 3: Recalculate the end_index based on the updated start_index and size.', '3.1: Set the new end_index value equal to the sum of the new start_index and the size.', "Step 4: Preserve the object's color unchanged during this transformation process.", 'Step 5: Update the object metadata using the newly calculated start_index, end_index, and preserved color.', 'Step 6: Output the transformed sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 33]
transformed objects: [{'color : 1, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, {'color': 1, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}]

Iterate through each object in the input sequence: Test input has 2 objects, and so does the test output.\n1.1 Retrieve the current object's properties (color, start\_index, end\_index, and size): Color is preserved, but there are issues with the indices and sizes in the test output.\n2. Perform the required positional adjustment on the object's start\_index, decreasing it by two units: Incorrect adjustments in the test output; Object_1 starts at -2 instead of the expected 0 and Object_2 starts at 3 instead of the expected 4.\n2.1 Calculate the new start\_index value by subtracting two from the original start\_index value: Failed calculation for both objects in the test output.\n3. Recalculate the end\_index based on the updated start\_index and size: Failed recalculation of end\_index for both objects in the test output.\n4. Preserve the object's color unchanged: Passed for both objects.\n5. Update the object metadata using the newly calculated start\_index, end\_index, and preserved color: Failed update for both objects in the test output.\n6. Output the transformed sequence: Transformed sequence appears incorrect due to failures in previous steps.",
