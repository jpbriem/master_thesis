Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: When N (N >= 2) adjacent objects have the same color and there is no other object of the same color between them, the end_index of the (N - 1)th object increases by (N - 1). This results in increasing the size of each affected object by N.\noverall pattern: Increase the end_index of every object by its own size minus one, ensuring that all adjacent objects of the same color are connected while maintaining their relative position and color.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: [ 'Iterate through the objects in the input.', 'For each object:',  'If it has at least one adjacent object with the same color and no other objects of the same color between them:',  ' Set count to the number of consecutive equal colored objects including the current object.',  ' Increment the end_index of the (count - 2)th object by (count - 1).', 'Return the modified object list as the output.' ] \n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

Here's what the output should look like:\n\n* Object 1 now has a color of 2, a start index of -1 (new position = 1 - ((3+2)/2) = -1), an end index of 5 (new position = 3 + ((3+2)/2) = 5), and a size of 5 (original size + 2).\n* Object 2 now has a color of 2, a start index of 4 (new position = 6 - ((1+2)/2) = 4), an end index of 6, and a size of 3 (original size + 2).\n\nHere is the final JSON response:\n```json\n{\n    \"input_description\": \"There are two objects with color 2 in the input sequence. Object 1 starts at position 1, ends at position 3, and originally has a size of 3. Object 2 starts and ends at position 6 with a size of 1.\",\n    \"transformation\": \"Both objects retained their original color and increased in size by 2 units while maintaining their relative positions.

There are two objects in this input.\n\n* Object 1 has a color value of 2, starts at index 1 and ends at index 3 with a total size of 3.\n* Object 2 has a color value of 2, starts at index 6 and ends at index 6 with a total size of 1.\n\nNow, let's apply the given transformation steps to these objects:\n\n1. Iterating through each object in the input.\n2. Retaining the original color of both objects - so color value remains 2 for both objects.\n3. Calculating the new size for each object:\n   * Object 1 original size was 3, after increasing by 2 units its new size becomes 5.\n   * Object 2 original size was 1, after increasing by 2 units its new size becomes 3.\n4. Determining the new start and end indices for each object:\n   * New Start Index = Original Start Index - (New Size - Original Size)/2\n     * Object 1: New Start Index = 1 - (5-3)/2 = 1\n     * Object 2: New Start Index = 6 - (3-1)/2 = 5\n   * New End Index = Original End Index + (New Size - Original Size)/2\n     * Object 1: New End Index = 3 + (5-3)/2 = 4\n     * Object 2: New End Index = 6 + (3-1)/2 = 7\n5.

Iterate through each object in the input.\n   - Check: Test input has two objects, and test output also shows two objects.\n2. Retain the original color of the current object.\n   - Check: Both objects retain their original color in the test output (Color: 2).\n3. Calculate the new size of the current object by increasing it by 2 units.\n   - Check: Transformed Object 1: Size = 5 (increased by 2); Transformed Object 2: Size = 3 (increased by 2).\n4. Determine the new start index of the current object by subtracting the difference between the new size and the original size divided by 2 from the original start index.\n   - Check: Transformed Object 1: New Start Index = 1 (correct); Transformed Object 2: New Start Index = 5 (correct).\n5. Determine the new end index of the current object by adding the difference between the new size and the original size divided by 2 to the original end index.\n   - Check: Transformed Object 1: New End Index = 4 (correct); Transformed Object 2: New End Index = 7 (correct).\n6. Replace the original object in the input with the new object with the updated properties.\n   - Note: There is no input after transformation; thus we cannot check replacement in the input directly. However, since the previous checks confirm compliance with the transformation rules, this final step can be assumed to be correct.\n\nAfter reviewing the test output based on the given criteria, I conclude that the transformation process appears to be correctly implemented. Therefore, my analysis suggests a rating of 10 for the test output.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input seems to be correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 10}\n------\n Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output:\n\n1. Iterate through each object in the input: This seems to have been done correctly, as there are two transformed objects in the output.\n2. Retain the original color of the current object: In both transformed objects, the color is 2, which matches the original color in the input.\n3. Calculate the new size of the current object by increasing it by 2 units: Transformed Object 1 has a size of 5 (original size 3 + 2) and Transformed Object 2 has a size of 3 (original size 1 + 2). This appears to be implemented correctly.\n4. Determine the new start index of the current object by subtracting the difference between the new size and the original size divided by 2 from the original start index: Transformed Object 1 has a start index of 1 (original start index 1 - (5-3)/2 = 1) and Transformed Object 2 has a start index of 5 (original start index 6 - (3-1)/2 = 5). This also appears to be implemented correctly.\n5. Determine the new end index of the current object by adding the difference between the new size and the original size divided by 2 to the original end index: Transformed Object 1 has an end index of 4 (original end index 3 + (5-3)/2 = 4) and Transformed Object 2 has an end index of 7 (original end index 6 + (3-1)/2 = 7). Again, this appears to be implemented correctly.\n6. Replace the original object in the input with the new object with the updated properties: Since we are analyzing the output, this step cannot be directly verified, but based on the previous checks, this seems to have been done correctly.\n\nOverall, the test output appears to implement the given transformation pattern and steps accurately. However, without actually running the code or observing the process, there might still be some discrepancies. Nevertheless, based on the information provided, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10 for adhering to the described pattern and steps.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'Consistently applies transformation pattern and steps across both objects in the input, resulting in accurate transformed objects.

Iterate through each object in the input: The test output shows that the two input objects have been processed.\n2. Retain the original color of the current object: The test output indicates that both objects retained their original color, 2.\n3. Calculate the new size of the current object by increasing it by 2 units: Both objects had their size increased by 2 units; Object\\_1 from 3 to 5 and Object\\_2 from 1 to 3.\n4. Determine the new start index of the current object by subtracting the difference between the new size and the original size divided by 2 from the original start index:\n\t* Object\\_1 had an original start index of 1 and a new size of 5. The difference is 4, and half of that is 2. Subtracting 2 from 1 results in -1. However, since indices cannot be negative, this may indicate an issue.\n\t* Object\\_2 had an original start index of 6 and a new size of 3. The difference is -3, and half of that is -1.5, which can be rounded down to -2. This might also suggest a problem, as indices cannot be negative.\n5. Determine the new end index of the current object by adding the difference between the new size and the original size divided by 2 to the original end index:\n\t* Object\\_1 had an original end index of 3 and a new size of 5. The difference is 2, and half of that is 1. Adding 1 to 3 results in 4, which matches the test output.\n\t* Object\\_2 had an original end index of 6 and a new size of 3. The difference is -3, and half of that is -1.5, which can be rounded up to -2. Adding -2 to 6 results in 4. While the value seems incorrect, the test output lists the end index as 7 instead. An inconsistency exists between the applied transformation and the expected outcome.\n\nIt appears there are discrepancies when calculating the new start and end indices. Since these calculations depend on each other and lead to conflicting results compared to the test output, it raises concerns about the accuracy of the transformation process. Additionally, some calculated indices are negative, which is not allowed in this context. Therefore, I would rate the test output as **3 out of 10**. It is clear that the high-level concept of expanding the objects has been attempted, but the implementation requires further refinement to match the intended behavior accurately.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

However, there is no such operation mentioned in the provided test output. It seems that part of the transformation is missing.\n   2.

According to the given pattern and steps, for any set of N (N>=2) adjacent objects having the same color without another object of the same color between them, the end\\_index of the (N-1)th object must increase by (N-1), thus connecting all adjacent objects of the same color and preserving their relative positions and colors.\n\nIn the test case, we observe two objects with color 2.

Return the modified object list as the output.\n   Check: Since there were errors before reaching this point, we cannot verify whether the return statement works properly.\n\nBased on our evaluation, some parts of the test output do not match the expected behavior based on the provided rules. I recommend reviewing the implementation, focusing on accurately identifying the groups of adjacent objects with the same color and updating the appropriate objects accordingly. Here is the final JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 5\n}\n```\n------\n Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output using the given transformation pattern and steps.\n\nFirst, we need to check whether the condition mentioned in the overall pattern is satisfied in the test output. According to the pattern, when N adjacent objects have the same color and there is no other object of the same color between them, the end\\_index of the (N - 1)th object increases by (N - 1).\n\nIn the test output, two objects of color 2 exist without any other object of the same color between them. Let's verify if the end\\_index of the first object (the (N - 1)th object) has been incremented by (N - 1), where N = 2:\n\nBefore transformation:\n* Object_1: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 3,'size': 3}\n* Object_2: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 6, 'end\\_index': 6,'size': 1}\n\nEnd indices after applying the transformation:\n* Object_1: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 6,'size': 4} // Increased by 3\n* Object_2: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 6, 'end\\_index': 9,'size': 3} // Increased by 3\n\nWe can observe that both objects meet the required conditions mentioned in the overall pattern. However, the increase in end\\_index value seems more than what would be expected (N - 1). To address this issue, we need to reevaluate the transformation steps provided.\n\nUpon reviewing the transformation steps, we find that the second step states: \"Increment the end\\_index of the (count - 2)th object by (count - 1)\", whereas the overall pattern suggests that the end\\_index should be increased by \"N - 1\". Given the discrepancy, considering the smaller adjustment described in the overall pattern would make the transformation consistent with the input-output examples. Hence, the correct change in end\\_index should be N - 1 instead of count - 1.\n\nApplying the correct transformation, we get the desired result below:\n\nEnd indices after applying the corrected transformation:\n* Object_1: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 4,'size': 3} // Increased by 2\n* Object_2: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 6, 'end\\_index': 8,'size': 2} // Increased by 2\n\nComparing the obtained results with the test output, we notice differences in the end\\_index values for both objects. With the corrected transformation, our final evaluation does not match the test output. Since the test output deviates from the actual transformation pattern, I cannot provide a concrete numerical rating. Instead, the rating based on the provided test output would be 0 out of 10, indicating incorrect application of the transformation.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
