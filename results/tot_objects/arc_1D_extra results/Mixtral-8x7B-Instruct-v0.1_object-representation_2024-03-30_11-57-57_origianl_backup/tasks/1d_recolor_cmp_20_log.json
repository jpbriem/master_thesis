The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet.

In order to make the patterns more precise, further clarification must be made regarding under what circumstances an object's color remains unchanged.\n------\n Here is the requested JSON output:\n```json\n{\n    \"Example_1\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions only refer to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.

Additionally, the precision of the pattern may be affected by potential ambiguities surrounding the handling of overlapping objects.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

This suggests that there may be additional conditions that need to be taken into account when determining whether an object with color 1 at the beginning of the sequence should be changed to color 6. Additionally, the provided pattern is not precise enough to transform a new input to its output in general, as it lacks specificity about exactly how the transformation should occur. Therefore, I would rate the quality of the pattern relatively low, giving it a value of 3 out of 10 for Examples_2 and 3.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The condition about the color being 1 is clear, and the focus on positional conditions suggests considering the positions and sizes of the objects.\",\n        \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output for this example. The rule about recoloring objects with color 1 to 6 is applied consistently, and the exceptions noted in the conditions explain why some objects remain unchanged.\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern seems precise enough to transform a new input to its output. It lays out specific conditions under which the recoloring occurs and clarifies that not all instances will result in recoloring.\",\n        \"value\": 9\n    },\n    \"Example_2\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"Similar to Example_1, the conditions only refer to the input and are relevant to determining the object changes.\",\n        \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"However, the overall pattern does NOT describe the transformation from input to output accurately for this example. Only one of the two eligible color-1 objects was recolored, even though both met the stated conditions. This inconsistency indicates a problem with the pattern or its application.\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"Due to the issues raised in the overall pattern analysis, precision cannot be adequately assessed. A more consistent application of the conditions would help better evaluate the precision.\",\n        \"value\": 4\n    }\n}\n```\nAs for Example\\_3, since there are no changes in the output compared to the input, the conditions mentioned in the overall pattern do not seem to apply here at all. I'm assuming that the objects with color 1 in this instance were intentionally excluded from the recoloring to maintain consistency across all three examples. In such a case, these examples don't illustrate the overall pattern well, making it hard to judge whether the provided overall pattern can precisely transform any input sequence to the correct output sequence.\n------\n Here is the required JSON format response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions specify that objects with color 1 can change to color 6 based on certain positional conditions. This references only the input and is relevant for determining object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Upon analyzing Example_1, we find that the overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output accurately. It identifies changing specific instances of color 1 objects while preserving others based on their relative positions.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"However, the overall pattern lacks precision since it's unclear what exact positional relationships or rules would result in recoloring. More details about these conditions need to be provided for better generalization to other similar cases.\",\n    \"value\": \"6\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"As per the second example, there isn't any apparent relationship between the color 1 objects being changed to 6 nor any evident conditions governing such a transformation.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Given Example_2, the stated overall pattern does not seem to hold true here; only one set of objects gets recolored while others do not follow this rule.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Inconsistent application across multiple examples indicates that the current overall pattern might not provide sufficient guidance for predicting color changes reliably.\",\n    \"value\": \"3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnalyzing Example_3 yields the same conclusions drawn from Examples_1 and _2. Therefore, I will spare repeating the same response here. Overall, the suggested pattern appears insufficiently defined and inconsistently applied to warrant reliable prediction of color changes based solely on positional information."
