#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}

output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 2 are recolored to 6 when their starting index has a parity condition; specifically, they must be at an even index.
overall pattern: Scan the input for objects with color 2. When found, check whether their starting index has a value divisible by 2 (even index). If so, recolor them to 6. Otherwise, leave them unchanged.

overall pattern:
conditions: Regarding all examples, objects change their color to 6 when they are positioned between two other objects with the same color. This suggests a condition where an object changes its color based on its neighboring objects.
overall pattern: Given an input with objects of color 2, iterate through each object. If an object is flanked by two other objects with the same color, change its color to 6. Otherwise, leave the object s color unchanged. The output will then match the desired transformation pattern.

overall pattern: Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the transformations involve changing the color of one or more objects. To define specific rules for this pattern, additional information about the conditions governing the transformations is necessary.

Explanation:

* `conditions_analysis` field contains an assessment of how well the given conditions apply to each example. In this case, there weren't any specific conditions provided, so I mentioned which properties would be considered for future reference.
* `overall_pattern_analysis` field assesses whether the described pattern matches the actual transformation. Mostly, the pattern holds true; however, in the third example, the alternating nature of the resulting colors was not reflected in the description.
* `precision_analysis` comments on the degree to which the pattern captures the nuances required to perform the transformation faithfully. This assessment helped me rate the pattern on a scale ranging from 0 to 10.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Regarding all examples, objects change their color to 6 when they are positioned between two other objects with the same color. This suggests a condition where an object changes its color based on its neighboring objects.
overall pattern: Given an input with objects of color 2, iterate through each object. If an object is flanked by two other objects with the same color, change its color to 6. Otherwise, leave the object s color unchanged. The output will then match the desired transformation pattern.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 6}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 20, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Regarding all examples, objects change their color to 6 when they are positioned between two other objects with the same color. This suggests a condition where an object changes its color based on its neighboring objects.
overall pattern: Given an input with objects of color 2, iterate through each object. If an object is flanked by two other objects with the same color, change its color to 6. Otherwise, leave the object s color unchanged. The output will then match the desired transformation pattern.


transformation steps: ['Iterate over each object O in the input sequence.', 'Check if there exists an object with color 2 at the index (O.start_index - 1) and index (O.end_index + 1).', 'If the previous and next objects exist and have color 2, set O.color = 6 in the output.', 'Otherwise, keep O.color unchanged in the output.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 7}

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the given input, here's the description of the objects, followed by the transformation and output JSON:

Input Description:
- Object_1 has a color of 2, starts at the first index, ends at the fifth index, and has a size of 5.
- Object_2 has a color of 2, starts at the ninth index, ends at the fifteenth index, and has a size of 7.

Transformation:
First, iterate through each object in the input sequence. Check if there exists an object with color 2 at the index (O.start\_index - 1) and index (O.end\_index + 1). If both previous and next objects exist and have color 2, set the current object's color to 6 in the output. Otherwise, keep the current object's color unchanged in the output.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
