Their start_index and end_index are adjusted so that they are centered around an index calculated as half of the total length minus the size divided by 2. This adjustment results in the objects maintaining their original shape while being moved to a new position.\noverall pattern: To transform any input into its output, follow these steps:                             1. Identify objects with a size greater than or equal to 10.                            2. Calculate the center index for each identified object using the formula: (total_length - size) / 2.                            3. Update the start_index and end_index of each object to be symmetrical around the calculated center index.
