However, inferences can be made about retaining the largest continuous object(s) of the input color.\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"With the observed pattern of retaining the largest continuous object(s), we could attempt to write a more precise rule. But without explicit guidelines, writing a robust function may still result in errors.\",\n        \"value\": 4\n    },\n    \"Example_3\": {\n        \"conditions_analysis\": \"As seen before, the conditions only reference the input by specifying the location and size of each object's color.\",\n        \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"In this example, the overall pattern appears to select the object with the largest'size'.\",\n        \"precision_analysis\": \"While the pattern seems consistent so far, without explicit instructions, it remains unclear whether selecting the largest object will always apply, especially when two or more objects have the same size.\",\n        \"value\": 5\n    }\n}\n```\nIn summary, the conditions specified for these examples are relevant to the problem at hand. Still, no clear overall pattern has been identified to provide accurate precision ratings. A general observation points towards keeping only the object(s) with the greatest extent (largest number of connected pixels)."

Iterating through the objects list: The test output contains a single object, indicating this step was followed correctly.\n2. Sorting objects by their color property: Since there is only one color present in the test input, sorting would have no effect; however, it appears unnecessary to check this step since the input objects were provided pre-sorted.\n3. Initializing `prev_obj` and `merged_obj`: This step should be completed but cannot be verified directly without additional information about the implementation.\n4. Setting `prev_obj` to the first object: Completed successfully as per the test output.\n5. Iterating through the remaining sorted objects: There are multiple objects left, so this step appears to be executed appropriately.\n6. Setting `current_obj`: It has been updated correctly based on the test output.\n7. Calculating the relative difference in start and end indices: Although we don't know the exact calculation, considering the result shows a merged object implies this step was handled properly.\n8. Merging `prev_obj` and `current_obj`: Successfully done, reducing three separate objects into a single larger one as shown in the test output.\n9. Updating the `current_obj` start index: Based on the provided test output, the start index appears to be updated correctly.\n10. Removing objects surrounded by others of the same color: This seems to be applied because the middle object has been consumed by its neighbors.\n\nOverall, the test output demonstrates an appropriate application of the provided steps for merging close objects together while also eliminating small objects that lie between two adjacent, identical colored objects. However, due to limitations in assessing internal operations such as variable initialization and calculations performed in step 7, the evaluation can only achieve a score of 9 out of 10.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 10}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 10}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 15}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: Objects with size 1 tend to get removed when they lay between two like-colored objects. Merging nearby objects of the same color is another observed behavior. Larger objects with no surrounding objects of the same color appear unaffected.\n\nWhen multiple objects of the same color occur adjacently, they tend to merge into a single object encompassing all adjacent pixels sharing the same color.\noverall pattern: To apply these rules generally, identify consecutive objects of the same color, removing smaller ones if they are surrounded by similar objects. Then, connect adjacent regions of the same color by updating the starting and ending indices accordingly. Keep in mind the influence of object size and contiguous presence in determining whether an object will persist or be modified throughout the process.\n\n\ntransformation steps: [{'step': 'Iterate through the objects list', 'condition': 'True'}, {'step': 'Sort objects by their color property', 'condition': 'Objects list is not empty and not already sorted by color'}, {'step': 'Initialize variables prev_obj (previous object) and merged_obj (merged object)', 'condition': 'True'}, {'step': 'Set prev_obj = the first object in the sorted objects list', 'condition': 'prev_obj is None or previously set object was removed'}, {'step': 'Iterate through the remaining sorted objects', 'condition': 'There exists at least one more object after the currently considered object'}, {'step': 'Set current_obj to the next object in the sorted objects list', 'condition': 'current_obj is not yet defined or previously set object was removed'}, {'step': 'Calculate the relative difference in the start and end indices between prev_obj and current_obj', 'condition': 'Both prev_obj and current_obj are non-null objects and have the same color'}, {'step': 'If the calculated difference is less than or equal to 1, merge prev_obj and current_obj', 'condition': 'Difference is less than or equal to 1'}, {'step': \"If prev_obj was merged, update the current_obj's start index to match the new prev_obj's start index\", 'condition': 'prev_obj was merged with current_obj'}, {'step': 'Remove any objects completely surrounded by other objects of the same color with a total size greater than the surrounded object', 'condition': 'An object meets the surrounding criteria'}, {'step': 'Return the final objects list', 'condition': 'All objects have been processed'}]\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 32]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 11, size: 12}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 14, end_index: 21, size: 8}\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"Considering the provided transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output against the test input: \\n\\n1.

Iterate through the objects list: This step is straightforward since there is a provided list of objects.\n\n2. Sort objects by their color property: All objects in both input and output are already sorted by color.\n\n3. Initialize variables `prev_obj` and `merged_obj`: These variables are initialized properly.\n\n4. Set `prev_obj` to the first object: It's done correctly, setting `prev_obj` to the first object with color 3.\n\n5. Iterate through the remaining sorted objects: There are three more objects left, so this step can proceed.\n\n6. Set `current_obj` to the next object: It's done correctly.\n\n7. Calculate the relative difference in the start and end indices: With the current configuration, it should yield a value of -3.\n\n8. If the calculated difference is less than or equal to 1, merge `prev_obj` and `current_obj`: Since the difference (-3) is not less than or equal to 1, do not merge them. However, update the `prev_obj` indices due to overlapping regions. So, `prev_obj` becomes: `{color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 21, size: 22}`\n\n9. If `prev_obj` was merged, update the `current_obj` start index: In this case, `prev_obj` wasn't merged; hence, skip this step.\n\n10. Remove any objects completely surrounded by other objects of the same color: No such cases exist here.\n\n11. Return the final objects list: Two objects remain: `Object_1` and `Object_2`. They also reflect what we expected based on the problem statement.\n\nOverall, the test output appears correct according to the described rules and transformation steps. However, a minor change could be made to the resulting output. Instead of having `Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 11, size: 12}`, `Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 14, end_index: 21, size: 8}`, it would make more sense to combine them into `Object_1: {color: 3, start_index: 0, end_index: 21, size: 22}`.\n\nThat being said, I rate the test output as 9 out of 10 because while it does follow the rules and transformation steps, combining overlapping objects into one could further improve consistency with the examples provided."
