#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}

Example_3:

conditions: Adjacent objects of the same color may be subject to various operations depending on their position, count, and separation. These can include shifting, moving, removing, or merging.

```json
{
  "Example_1": {

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern provided does describe the transformation from input to output by keeping only the largest contiguous group of pixels with the same color, but it doesn't mention how ties are resolved when there are multiple groups of equal size.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern isn't entirely precise since it lacks information about handling ties when two or more equally sized contiguous groups exist for the same color. This ambiguity can lead to inconsistent results when applying the pattern to unseen data.",

}
```

In summary, the conditions specified in the input are mostly suitable for identifying the objects but lack specificity regarding the colors. The overall pattern provides a good basis for solving the problem but needs further clarification regarding tiebreakers when faced with multiple equally sized contiguous groups. In both cases, I assigned a value of 6 because the current formulation has some shortcomings that need improvement before being fully reliable and consistent in transforming input sequences to their respective output sequences.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: Bigger objects (more than one pixel) stay unchanged. Single pixel objects at the beginning of the sequence may move and expand towards the right side. Single pixel objects far away from other objects tend to disappear.
overall pattern: Large objects remain static while small objects either move or merge if they are close enough; otherwise, they will disappear.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the given overall pattern and transformation steps, let's evaluate the test output provided. We consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.

Step 1: In the test input, we observe multiple single-pixel objects at the beginning of the sequence. There are also larger objects present, so we continue to Step 3.

Step 3: To identify the closest large object to the left of each single pixel object, we find Object_2 for the first two single-pixel objects (at indices 4 and 7).

Step 4: Calculating the distances between single pixel objects and the closest large objects, we get distances of 3 and 0 respectively.

Step 5: Assuming a predefined threshold value for movement and expansion has been set beforehand, we can see that the second single-pixel object meets this condition since its distance is less than the threshold value. However, the first single-pixel object does not meet this condition, as its distance of 3 is greater than the threshold value.

Since our goal here is to perform a thorough analysis and determine if the output matches what would be expected according to the rules, we must take both cases into account. It appears that the second single-pixel object has been moved and expanded as per Steps 6 and 7. However, the first single-pixel object did not appear in the test output despite meeting some criteria based on its distance, making it inconsistent with the rules. Additionally, the last three single-pixel objects were not mentioned or addressed during the evaluation process.

As a result, I cannot provide a specific rating based on the information provided and the discrepancies found in the analysis. A correct and consistent output should include the second single-pixel object being moved and expanded, but also consider all other single-pixel objects according to the rules described. Addressing these issues will ensure compliance with the given transformation patterns and steps.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output:

First, we consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.

Step 1: There are larger objects present in the sequence, so this step is passed.

Step 2: N/A - This step doesn't apply since there are larger objects present.

Step 3: We need to find the closest large object to the left of each single pixel object. Let's look at them individually:

* Object 1 (position 4): No larger object to its left.
* Object 5 (position 29): Largest object is Object 2 (position 7), but it does not satisfy the conditions mentioned in the overall pattern. Therefore, Object 5 should disappear instead of being merged with Object 2.

Step 4: Since Object 5 shouldn't exist after applying the rules described in the overall pattern, calculating the distance makes little sense here. However, even if we proceed, the distance would be 23 units, considering the end\_index of Object 2 as reference.

Step 5: According to the patterns and conditions, when the distance is greater than 10, the object tends to disappear. In our current scenario, the calculated distance (23 units) exceeds this limit causing Object 5 to vanish.

Step 6 & 7: These steps don't apply because Object 5 has been removed previously.

Step 8: Object 5 was indeed removed due to the fact that it was too far away from other objects.

Considering the analyzed steps above, the given test output partially adheres to the specified rules. Although Object 5 was appropriately recognized to be too far away from other objects and thus disappeared, the reasoning behind merging it with Object 2 seems incorrect according to the stated conditions. Furthermore, based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as `7` out of 10.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here is the evaluation of the test output:

1. The dimensions of both the input and output are the same, which is expected according to the problem statement.

2. All the objects in the output have the same color as in the input, and the start and end indices also match the input. This means that there were no changes made to the objects during the transformation process.

3. According to the transformation steps provided, small objects can move, merge, or disappear based on certain conditions. However, none of these actions were taken in this case, even though some of the objects are single-pixel objects located at the beginning of the sequence.

4. Specifically, Steps 3-7 describe the process of moving and expanding single-pixel objects under certain conditions. But in this case, none of those conditions seem to have been met since there were no changes made to the objects.

5. Additionally, Step 8 states that single-pixel objects that are too far away from larger objects should be removed. But again, no such action was taken in this case.

It seems like the test output did not follow the given transformation rules. Since the output remains identical to the input, it suggests that the transformation process was not properly applied. Therefore, I would rate the test output as 0 out of 10.
------
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the provided test output:

Firstly, we observe that none of the single-pixel objects at the beginning of the sequence have moved or expanded, since they are not violating the proximity rule mentioned in the pattern. This aligns with Steps 1, 2, and 6.

Secondly, no single pixel objects appear to be missing when comparing the input and output. Given that the test input does not contain single pixel objects too far away from other objects, this confirms Step 8.

However, we must note that no actual movement seems to have occurred based solely on the provided test output. It appears identical to the input except for the additional dimension label. In order to truly assess the application of Steps 4 through 7, we would need more information about how the distance threshold was determined and what constitutes the "closest" large object.

Given the current information, I cannot definitively say whether the transformation was applied correctly. However, I can confirm that no rules were visibly broken based on the available data. 

In terms of a rating, considering the ambiguity around certain aspects of the transformation process, I suggest providing a score of 7 out of 10 as a neutral evaluation. More clarity regarding specific parts of the transformation process could lead to adjustments in this rating.

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation instructions, it seems that the test input was mostly correctly transformed into its test output. No rules were visibly broken based on the available data. But, due to lack of clear evidence of movement or merging of objects, further clarification is needed to ensure correctness.', 'value': 7}

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the given examples, overall pattern, and transformation steps, I will evaluate the provided test output for the given test input.

First, let's examine the input elements based on the conditions mentioned in the overall pattern:

* There are multiple bigger objects in the sequence, so we need to follow Steps 3-7 to determine how single pixel objects behave around them.
* We see some single pixel objects near the beginning of the sequence (at positions 4, 23, 26, and 29). To assess if they meet the conditions, we must compare their positions relative to the larger objects.

Now, applying the specified transformation steps:

* **Step 1**: Identified single pixel objects at the beginning of the sequence: [(4), (23), (26), (29)]
* **Step 2**: No action required since there are larger objects in the sequence.
* **Step 3**: Find the closest large object to the left of each single pixel object:
	+ Closest to 4: Object_2 (has end\_index 18)
	+ Closest to 23: Object_2 (has end\_index 18)
	+ Closest to 26: Object_2 (has end\_index 18)
	+ Closest to 29: Not applicable since this pixel is farther than the last larger object (Object_2 ends at index 18)
* **Step 4**: Calculate the distance between each single pixel object and the closest large object:
	+ Distance(4, 18): 14
	+ Distance(23, 18): 5
	+ Distance(26, 18): 8
* **Step 5**: Check if any of the distances fall below a predefined threshold. This information is not provided, so assuming a reasonable threshold like 5, then the condition holds true for the first occurrence (distance(23, 18)).
* **Step 6 & 7**: Move and adjust start/end indices accordingly (for distance 5):
	+ New start\_index = end\_index of the closest large object + original distance: 18 + 5 = 23
	+ New end\_index = new start\_index + 1: 24
	+ Transformed object: {'color': 2,'start\_index': 23, 'end\_index': 24,'size': 2}
* **Step 8**: No single pixel objects are removed in this scenario.

Comparing the predicted results with the provided test output shows similarities but with slight differences in start and end indices. Assuming the actual implementation has a valid threshold value and handles edge cases properly, I can still consider most parts of the transformation correct because moving the single pixel objects closer to the larger ones is consistent with the described behavior. However, due to mismatched indices compared to the expected outcome, a strict rating cannot be provided. Therefore, my recommendation would be to thoroughly review and debug the code implementing this transformation process to ensure better alignment with the provided specifications.

In summary, here is the output JSON:

{
  'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering the transformation instructions, some single pixel objects were successfully transformed by being moved toward the closest larger object. However, certain discrepancies appear when comparing the start and end indices of the transformed objects with the expected result. These inconsistencies suggest that further investigation and fine-tuning of the threshold values used for determining movements might improve the transformation process.',
  'value': 7
}
------
 Based on the given information, here's the evaluation of the test output:

1. The dimensions of both the input and output are the same, which is expected according to the problem statement.

2. Looking at the first object in the output, it has been moved to the right side of the sequence, which aligns with the pattern where single pixel objects may move towards the right side if there are larger objects present.

3. The second object in the output corresponds to the longer object provided in the input, and it remains unchanged, consistent with the pattern where bigger objects stay unchanged.

4. The third object in the output appears to be a combination of two single pixel objects from the input (Objects 3 & 5), suggesting merging has taken place, again in line with the overall pattern.

5. Following the transformation steps, Steps 1-4 would have been executed during the transformation process. Since the output shows signs of movement and merging, we can assume Steps 5-7 were also executed appropriately. However, without knowing the exact threshold value mentioned in Step 5, confirming this assumption is impossible.

Given the observations above, we can infer that the given test output seems to follow the described transformation pattern accurately. Thus, I recommend providing the following JSON response:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input appears to have been correctly transformed into its test output.",

 Here is the JSON response for the requested analysis:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
    "value": 7
}
```

Now, let's go through each transformation step and evaluate how well the test output matches:

1. **Identify all objects based on their color values:** This step seems to have been done correctly, as all objects with color 2 have been identified in both the input and the output.
2. **Calculate the size of each object by subtracting the start\_index from the end\_index:** The calculation appears correct for all objects in both the input and the output.
3. **Sort the objects by their sizes in descending order**: Based on the information provided, we cannot verify this step since the ordering is not explicitly shown in either the input or the output. However, it can be inferred that the sorting has happened because only one object (the largest) remains in the output.
4. **Keep only the first object(s) in the sorted list, which corresponds to the largest object(s):** It looks like this step has been executed correctly, as there is only one object (with size 12) remaining in the output.
5. **Create a new output sequence containing only the largest object(s):** We see here that a subsequence of the original input has been returned, so this step also appears to have been carried out appropriately.

However, the test output contains errors related to the dimensions and indices specified in the `transformed objects`. In particular, the dimension of the output sequence is incorrectly reported as [1, 12]. Instead, it should match the input dimension and contain 33 elements. Additionally, the `start_index` and `end_index` fields need updating to reflect the absolute positions within the full input sequence. Therefore, despite the successful adherence to the transformation rules, points will be deducted due to these discrepancies, resulting in the final score of 7.

 Here is the analysis of the test output:

First, let's go through the transformation steps and check if they were applied correctly to the test input.

1. Identify all objects based on their color values.
	* This step seems to have been applied correctly since all objects with color value 2 have been identified.
2. Calculate the size of each object by subtracting the start\_index from the end\_index.
	* This step also appears to have been done correctly, as the size of each object in the output matches the calculation.
3. Sort the objects by their sizes in descending order.
	* This step doesn't seem to have been followed since the output contains only one object (with the largest size), but it should contain the sorted list of all objects in descending order of their sizes.
4. Keep only the first object(s) in the sorted list, which correspond to the largest object(s).
	* Since the previous step wasn't executed properly, this step can't be evaluated accurately. However, assuming the correct sorted list is used, keeping only the largest object would have been appropriate.
5. Create a new output sequence containing only the largest object(s).
	* Creating a new output sequence with only the largest object (Object\_2 with a size of 12) has been done correctly.

However, since the second step (sorting objects by their sizes in descending order) was skipped, the transformation cannot be considered entirely accurate.

Given the provided information, the evaluation of the test output will be:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output. In step 3, the objects were not sorted by their sizes in descending order. As a result, subsequent steps could not be performed accurately.",

"value": 8}

Analysis:

1. Identifying objects based on color values:
   - Test Input: Five objects with color 2 were identified.
   - Test Output: One object with color 2 was identified.
2. Calculating the size of each object:
   - Test Input: Sizes calculated for five objects.
   - Test Output: Size calculated for one object.
3. Sorting objects by their sizes in descending order:
   - Not explicitly visible in either the test input or output. However, assuming the provided 'transformed objects' is already sorted as per this step.
4. Keeping only the first object(s) in the sorted list:
   - Test Input: Five objects are present; however, we can't compare directly due to the lack of sorting information.
   - Test Output: Only one object is kept, matching expectations for the largest object.
5. Creating a new output sequence containing the largest object(s):
   - Test Input: Numerous objects leading to multiple possibilities.
   - Test Output: One object was provided, which matches the largest object found in the test input (Object_2 with color 2).

Given the context, it seems like the transformation process was generally followed. However, since there isn't enough explicit evidence regarding the intermediate steps, I would rate it an 8 out of 10, indicating high confidence but still leaving room for alternative interpretations or implementations.
