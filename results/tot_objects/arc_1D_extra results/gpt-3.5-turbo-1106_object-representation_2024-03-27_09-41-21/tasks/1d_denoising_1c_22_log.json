For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The condition for the transformation is that the output object will have the same color, starting index, ending index, and size as the largest object in the input. The transformation is consistent across all examples.\noverall pattern: The largest object in the input becomes the only object in the output. The output object inherits its color, position, and size from the largest object in the input.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the largest object in the input based on the size.', 'Create a new object in the output with the same color, starting index, ending index, and size as the largest object in the input.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.
