You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: The objects' colors, positions, and sizes are maintained in the output compared to the input, with a consistent shift in position indices for each object.
overall pattern: The input objects' color, position, and size are preserved in the output, with a fixed shift in position indices for each object. The transformation from input to output is based on maintaining the input object's properties while adjusting their position indices.


transformation steps: ['For each object in the input sequence, maintain the color and size of the object in the output sequence.', 'Adjust the start and end indices of each object in the output sequence by applying a fixed shift in position indices. This shift is consistent for all objects and is based on the overall pattern observed in the examples.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}
output:
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}
test case output dimension: [1, 33]
