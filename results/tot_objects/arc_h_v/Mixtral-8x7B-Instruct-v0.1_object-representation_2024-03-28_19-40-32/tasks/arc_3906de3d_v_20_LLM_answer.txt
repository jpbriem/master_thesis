#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, coordinates, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, coordinates, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

'conditions': 'certain objects change because they are initially positioned on columns 4, 6, or 9; since these columns correspond to multiples of 3, it suggests that some kind of modulo operation or periodic boundary condition is applied along the horizontal direction, causing objects to shift horizontally when their original position exceeds a certain threshold; this behavior could be described mathematically as p = (x % n) + d, where x is the original position, n is the period length, p is the new position after shifting, and d is an offset value; in this case, n seems to be equal to 3, d appears to be equal to 1 for objects with color 3 and -2 for objects with color 7, and % denotes the modulus operator; furthermore, the lack of vertical shifting suggests that either there is no such condition or constraint along the vertical direction, or it has a larger period length compared to the horizontal direction.'

'conditions':'similar to Example_1, this behavior could be caused by a combination of modulo operation and periodic boundary conditions, with possibly unequal period lengths along the horizontal and vertical directions; another plausible explanation is the application of a matrix transformation, such as rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflection, followed by translation; these operations would preserve the connectivity and orientation of the objects while changing their position and possibly aspect ratio or angle; additional analysis may be needed to distinguish between these hypotheses and identify the exact pattern.'

'conditions': 'this behavior resembles a combination of reflection or flipping and translation, with possible rescaling or distortion of the objects; a candidate transformation consists of reflecting the input across the vertical axis centered at column 5, then shifting the reflected image horizontally by two columns to the left, and finally exchanging the positions of the first two cells in the resulting array; this transformation captures most features of the observed pattern, including the swapped order of the first and second objects; further analysis may be necessary to confirm the details and validate the hypothesis.'

'overall\_pattern': 'given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.'

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.

Value Outputs:
 Here's the output in the requested JSON format:

```json

  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes in the example. They include position, size, and color of the objects.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output in this example. It involves applying a series of matrix transformations such as rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflection, then applying periodic boundary conditions based on position and color, and repeating as necessary to reach a stable configuration.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern appears to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output in this example. However, further testing with additional inputs would help confirm this.",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes in the example. They include position, size, and color of the objects.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output in this example. It involves applying a series of matrix transformations such as rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflection, then applying periodic boundary conditions based on position and color, and repeating as necessary to reach a stable configuration.",
    "precision_analysis": "The overall pattern appears to be precise enough to transform a new input to its output in this example. However, further testing with additional inputs would help confirm this.",

  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes in the example. They include position, size, and color of the objects.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output in this example.

}
```
In general, the overall pattern seems to describe the relationship between the input and output adequately. However, without access to the actual code or algorithm used to generate the output, it is difficult to provide a definitive assessment of precision. Further testing with additional inputs would help to confirm the accuracy and precision of the overall pattern.
------
 Here's the JSON response for the analysis of the given pattern based on the three examples provided:

```json
{
    "Example_1": {
        "conditions_analysis": "The conditions mentioned in the overall pattern seem to be applicable to the input and relevant to determining the changes. However, they appear to be quite general and do not specify the exact transformations for each color or shape.",
        "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern seems to describe the transformation from input to output reasonably well for Example_1. It involves applying certain matrix transformations such as rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflection to each object, followed by translation according to periodic boundary conditions. This results in a stable configuration which is the desired output.",
        "precision_analysis": "The precision of the overall pattern for Example_1 is moderate, but it does not provide specific details about how to perform the transformation. For instance, the pattern doesn't define which objects need to be transformed, what type of transformation (rotation, scaling, etc.) needs to be applied, and when to stop iterating through the steps. These missing specifics make it difficult to accurately predict the outcome for a new input.",
        "value": 6
    },
    "Example_2": {
        "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
        "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern appears to fit this example as well. It captures the essence of the transformation – applying matrix operations followed by translation using periodic boundary conditions.",
        "precision_analysis": "As observed earlier, the lack of detail in the overall pattern impacts its precision. In particular, it is unclear how the'stable configuration' is defined and detected, making it challenging to replicate this process on new inputs.",
        "value": 6
    },
    "Example_3": {
        "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
        "overall_pattern_analysis": "For this example, the overall pattern again matches the given input-output pair. It demonstrates the application of matrix transformations along with periodic boundary conditions.",
        "precision_analysis": "Again, due to the lack of specificity in the overall pattern, it remains uncertain how to precisely map the input to output. A detailed algorithm would significantly improve the precision of the described pattern.",
        "value": 6
    }
}
```

Overall, the given pattern provides a conceptual understanding of the underlying transformation across all examples but falls short when attempting to apply it to new inputs due to the insufficient level of detail. To achieve higher precision, it is necessary to outline clearer instructions for performing the required transformations and detecting stable configurations.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: given an input consisting of objects with various colors, shapes, and sizes, each object will move right by one pixel if its leftmost coordinate is greater than -1 and less than 9 and its row index is lower than 9.
overall pattern: each object maintains its original shape, size, and color, but moves right by one pixel under the specified conditions.

Value Outputs:
 Here's the analysis for the three examples using the provided overall pattern:

Example\_1:
{'Example\_1': \['Regarding Example 1, the given conditions state that each object will move right by one pixel if its leftmost coordinate is greater than -1 and less than 9 and its row index is lower than 9. This accurately describes the movement of objects in this example.\',\
'In Example 1, the overall pattern holds true since all objects maintain their original shape, size, and color while moving right by one pixel under the specified conditions.\',\
'The precision of the given overall pattern is high, making it suitable to transform a new input to its output in most cases.\',\
8'\]}

Example\_2:
{'Example\_2': \['Regarding Example 2, the given conditions state that each object will move right by one pixel if its leftmost coordinate is greater than -1 and less than 9 and its row index is lower than 9. However, there appears to be no such movement in this example.\',\
' In Example 2, the overall pattern does not hold because objects do not move right by one pixel, nor do they maintain their original shape, size, and color in some cases.\',\
' Since the overall pattern fails in this example, the given conditions cannot create a reliable mapping for new inputs.\',\
1'\]}

Example\_3:
{'Example\_3': \['Regarding Example 3, the given conditions state that each object will move right by one pixel if its leftmost coordinate is greater than -1 and less than 9 and its row index is lower than 9. While some objects seem to move, others remain unchanged, contradicting the stated conditions.\',\
' In Example 3, the overall pattern also fails because objects do not consistently move right or maintain their original properties.\',\
' Due to inconsistencies in the pattern, relying on these conditions would not result in accurate transformations for new inputs.\',\
2'\]}

These analyses indicate that the pattern works well for Example\_1 but not for Examples\_2 and 3. Therefore, the overall pattern requires further refinement to better handle multiple scenarios before applying it to new inputs.

 Here's the JSON formatted output as requested:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The conditions mentioned in the pattern apply only to the input. However, there seems to be no specific condition related to determining the changes made in the example.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output for this example. It accurately explains how objects maintain their shape, size, and color while moving right by one pixel under the specified conditions.",
    "precision_analysis": "The precision of the given overall pattern is sufficient to transform a new input to its output. But, the pattern lacks clarity on what happens when an object reaches the boundary (column = 9) after shifting right.",
    "value": "7"
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the conditions mentioned in the pattern apply only to the input. Again, there isn't any specific condition related to determining the changes made in the example.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern also holds good for this example. As before, it accurately depicts how objects preserve their shape, size, and color while moving right by one pixel according to the stated conditions.",
    "precision_analysis": "As in Example_1, the provided overall pattern has adequate precision; however, it fails to address cases where objects reach the boundary after shifting right.",
    "value": "7"
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Just like previous examples, the conditions mentioned in the pattern apply solely to the input, without specifying anything about the actual changes observed.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "For this example too, the overall pattern proves to be accurate in describing the transformation from input to output—objects keep their shape, size, and color intact while moving right by one pixel under the defined conditions.",
    "precision_analysis": "As with Examples_1 and 2, the given overall pattern shows satisfactory precision but remains unclear about handling instances when objects reach the boundary after shifting right.",
    "value": "7"
  }
}
```
Although the overall pattern captures the essence of the transformation happening across these examples, it falls short of providing clear instructions on edge case management – i.e., what happens when an object moves beyond the available columns during the shift to the right. Addressing and clarifying such conditions would enhance the pattern's comprehensiveness and applicability for broader scenarios.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: for all examples, certain objects move to the right by a fixed distance depending on their position in the grid. This distance appears to be determined by the row index of the bottom right corner of each object.
overall pattern: to apply this pattern to any input, find the row index of the bottom right corner of each object, then shift the object to the right by that many pixels. If an object has multiple rows, use the largest row index.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input grid into its output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions': 'regarding the first example, list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation, focusing on shape, size, coordinates, values, counts, symmetry', 'transformation': 'regarding the first example, describe the transformation steps needed to transform the input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input grid into its output grid, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

###########################################################
Sample Outputs:
 Here are the transformation steps for the given input-output pairs:

1. Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.
3. Adjust the coordinates of each object according to the following rules:
   - For each object, find the minimum x-coordinate (row index) among its coordinates.
   - Subtract this minimum value from the x-coordinate of each coordinate pair in the object.
   - Repeat the above two steps for the y-coordinate (column index).

These transformation steps ensure that each object remains unchanged while adjusting their positions based on the overall pattern provided. Below is the JSON output format for the input-output pairs.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.

Sample Outputs:
 Here are the detailed steps to transform the input grid into its output grid, based on the overall pattern provided:

Transformation steps:

1. Determine the dimensions of the input grid and initialize an empty output grid of the same size.
2. Iterate through each object in the input grid and perform the following sub-steps:
   1. Extract the color, coordinates, and size of the current object.
   2. Apply the matrix transformation (rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection) to the object's coordinates, based on its size and position.
   3. Calculate the new position of the object based on the periodic boundary conditions determined by its color. This could involve wrapping the object around the edges of the grid if it reaches the boundaries.
   4. Update the output grid with the transformed object's coordinates.
3. Repeat steps 2a-2d until a stable configuration is reached, i.e., no further changes occur in the output grid.

Now, here are the specific transformations for each example:

Example\_1:
conditions:

* Objects with color 3 appear before objects with color 7.
* Each object has the same width but varying heights.
* There is a consistent spacing between objects of the same color.

transformation:

1. Initialize an empty output grid of size [10, 10].
2. For each object in the input grid, do the following:

a. If the object's color is 3, then shift its y-coordinate to the right by 1 unit.
b. If the object's color is 7, then shift its y-coordinate to the left by 1 unit.
c. Add the updated object's coordinates to the output grid.

Example\_2:

Same transformation as Example\_1, except with a larger number of objects and a slightly modified shifting rule:

1. If the object's color is 3, then shift its y-coordinate to the right by 1 unit.
2. If the object's color is 7, then shift its y-coordinate to the left by 1 unit, and move it down by 1 unit if it is located in row 1.

Example\_3:

In this example, objects alternate between colors 3 and 7, so the transformation shifts them horizontally based on their color:

1. Initialize an empty output grid of size [10, 10].
2. For each object in the input grid, do the following:

a. If the object's color is 3, then shift its x-coordinate to the left by 1 unit.
b. If the object's color is 7, then shift its x-coordinate to the right by 1 unit.
c. Add the updated object's coordinates to the output grid.

transformation\_steps:

1. Given an input grid, extract the dimensions and objects.
2. Define a function that applies the appropriate transformation based on the conditions observed in the examples.
3. Iteratively update the output grid using the defined function until a stable configuration is reached.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: across all examples, there were no conditions that determined changes; rather, every object retained its original properties (color, coordinates, and size) in the output
overall pattern: transform the input by retaining all objects (i.e., their color, coordinates, and size) exactly as they appear in the input grid



transformation steps: [     {'step': 'Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.', 'type': 'adjustment'},     {'step': 'Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).', 'type': 'adjustment'}   ]

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input grid into its output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, coordinates, and color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, coordinates, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input: "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: across all examples, there were no conditions that determined changes; rather, every object retained its original properties (color, coordinates, and size) in the output
overall pattern: transform the input by retaining all objects (i.e., their color, coordinates, and size) exactly as they appear in the input grid


transformation steps: [     {'step': 'Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.', 'type': 'adjustment'},     {'step': 'Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).', 'type': 'adjustment'}   ]

 Based on the provided information, here is the solution for the test case:

Input description:
The input contains three objects. Object 1 has a color of 3 and coordinates at (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1), making its size 3. Object 2 has a color of 7 and a single coordinate at (9,1), making its size 1. Object 3 has a color of 3 and coordinates at (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2), making its size 3.

Transformation:
Following the transformation steps, we identify all objects in the input grid, retain their color, coordinates, and size, and then adjust their coordinates. After adjusting the coordinates of each object, we get the following:

* Object 1 remains unchanged with a color of 3 and coordinates at (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).
* Object 2 remains unchanged with a color of 7 and a single coordinate at (9,1).
* Object 3 remains unchanged with a color of 3 and coordinates at (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2).

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.

Next to a few example input-output pairs, you are given a new test case with a new input grid. Your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, coordinates, and color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, coordinates, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input: "[Object_ID: {\'color\': \'object color\', \'coordinates\': [[row_1,col_1], [row_2,col_2], ..], \'size\': \'number of pixels\'}, ...]'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.

Applying the overall pattern described earlier, the transformation steps would involve applying matrix transformations (rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflections) to each object based on its size and position, followed by applying periodic boundary conditions based on the object's position and color. We don't have specific transformation steps provided in this question, so I will attempt to provide a general description of what the transformed objects might look like.

In the transformed grid, the objects appear to maintain their size, shape, and relative positions but undergo some form of linear transformation such as a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees, uniform scaling, and horizontal and vertical flipping. Additionally, they seem to follow certain periodic boundary conditions where the left edge is connected to the right edge, and the bottom edge is connected to the top edge, creating a toroidal structure. Here's a description of the transformed objects:

'color': 3,

 Based on the input description, the objects present in the input grid are:

* Object\_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]],'size': 3}

* Object\_12: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[6, 8], [7, 8], [8, 8], [9, 8]],'size': 4}

As per the provided overall pattern, our task is to perform a series of matrix transformations (including rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflection), then apply periodic boundary conditions based on the object's position and color, and finally, repeat the process until a stable configuration is achieved. In this particular case, however, without explicit instructions in the transformation steps, it is difficult to precisely define what operations to perform. Nevertheless, I will provide an answer assuming the goal is to arrange the objects horizontally in two rows while preserving their original dimensions.

Transformed objects for the test output would appear as follows:

* Object\_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]],'size': 3}
* Object\_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 2]],'size': 1}
* Object\_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2]],'size': 3}

Based on the overall pattern and transformation steps provided, it seems that the task is to apply a series of matrix transformations (rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection) to each object, followed by translation according to certain boundary conditions. However, since no specific transformation steps were given, I will provide a general description of how the objects should look like in the test output.

For this input, the output would contain objects of similar sizes but possibly shifted positions due to the application of matrix transformations and boundary conditions. Here is a possible output description:

Transformed objects:

* Object\_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3]],'size': 3}, where x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, and y3 represent the new positions after transformations and translations.
* Object\_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[x4, y4]],'size': 1}, where x4 and y4 represent the new position after transformations and translations.
* Object\_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[x5, y5], [x6, y6], [x7, y7]],'size': 3}, where x5, y5, x6, y6, x7, and y7 represent the new positions after transformations and translations.
* Object\_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[x8, y8], [x9, y9]],'size': 2}, where x8, y8, x9, and y9 represent the new positions after transformations and translations.
* Object\_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[x10, y10], [x11, y11],..., [x16, y16]],'size': 7}, where x10, y10,..., x16, and y16 represent the new positions after transformations and translations.

* Object 2: Color 7, Coordinates [[9, 1]], Size 1
* Object 3: Color 3, Coordinates [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2]], Size 3
* Object 4: Color 7, Coordinates [[8, 2], [9, 2]], Size 2

* Object 12: Color 7, Coordinates [[6, 8], [7, 8], [8, 8], [9, 8]], Size 4

As for the transformation, applying the overall pattern and transformation steps provided, it appears that no specific changes need to be made. We simply follow the pattern to determine the output:

* Identify and maintain unique objects with alternating colors (Objects 1 to 12).
* There are no additional instructions or conditions to modify these objects. Therefore, the output will consist of the same objects in the same locations.

Output:
{'input\_description': 'Three horizontal lines of color 3 and two vertical segments of color 7 along with three other groups of connected color 3 dots. Sizes ranging from 1 to 7.',
'transformation': 'No change in shape, size, or orientation required. Maintain the same positions for each group of connected dots and their respective colors.',

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: across all examples, there were no conditions that determined changes; rather, every object retained its original properties (color, coordinates, and size) in the output
overall pattern: transform the input by retaining all objects (i.e., their color, coordinates, and size) exactly as they appear in the input grid

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.",
    "value": 1
}
```

Now I will explain why I gave a score of 1 out of 10. My goal here is to provide constructive criticism so that you can identify any discrepancies and improve the process accordingly.

Step 1: Identify all objects in the input grid.
This step seems to be correct, as the input grid contains identified objects with their respective properties.

Step 2: Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.
Again, this step seems to be followed accurately based on the provided input grid.

However, when we look at the test case output, we notice some issues regarding coordinate adjustments and dimensions. It appears that the last two adjustment steps either had errors during implementation or weren't fully executed. In particular:

1. Coordinates aren't adjusted according to the minimum x and y indices. This causes unexpected negative coordinates, overlapping objects, and loss of data due to clipping. For example, `Object_1` has `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 1]`, and `[-1, 2]` as its new coordinates after the transformation steps. These coordinates don't make sense since the new origin cannot contain negative indices. Additionally, several other objects suffer from this issue.

2. There's inconsistency between the expected and actual output grid sizes. While the input grid has a dimension of [10, 10], the transformed objects' coordinates suggest that the output grid should have a larger dimension. However, it doesn't seem like such a change occurred in the provided test case output.

In summary, while the first two steps related to identifying and preserving objects were performed adequately, the final two steps involving coordinate adjustments and setting the output grid dimensions need improvement. Please double-check these steps and address the mentioned concerns to ensure accurate results.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the expected transformation steps.

Transformation Steps:
1. Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.
3. Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.
4. Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).

Test Output Analysis:

1. All objects in the input grid have been identified correctly.
2. The color, coordinates, and size of each object seem to be retained as they appear in the input grid. However, we notice negative values in the coordinates, which indicates that the adjustments mentioned in steps 3 and 4 have not been performed correctly.

According to steps 3 and 4, we should find the minimum x and y coordinates for each object and adjust the coordinates accordingly. For example, object 1 has coordinates [0,1],[1,1],[2,1]. The minimum x-coordinate here is 0, so we would expect the adjusted coordinates to be [0,0],[1,0],[2,0]. Similarly, for the y-coordinate, since the minimum is 1, we would leave the y-coordinates unchanged.

However, in the test output, the first object has coordinates [[-1, 0],[-1, 1],[-1, 2]]. These do not match our expected coordinates after adjustment, indicating that the minimum x and y coordinates have not been calculated and subtracted properly for each object.

Therefore, based on the observed issues with coordinate adjustments, I would rate the test output a 3 out of 10. The transformation process seems to retain object properties but fails to perform the necessary adjustments to the coordinates.

overall pattern:
conditions: across all examples, there were no conditions that determined changes; rather, every object retained its original properties (color, coordinates, and size) in the output
overall pattern: transform the input by retaining all objects (i.e., their color, coordinates, and size) exactly as they appear in the input grid


transformation steps: [     {'step': 'Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.', 'type': 'adjustment'},     {'step': 'Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).', 'type': 'adjustment'}   ]

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the transformation steps, the test output seems to have incorrectly adjusted the coordinates of the objects. According to the given steps, the minimum x-coordinate among the coordinates of each object should be found and then subtracted from each x-coordinate. Similarly, the minimum y-coordinate should be found and subtracted from each y-coordinate. However, the test output shows negative x-coordinates, indicating that either the absolute values of the minimum coordinates were not computed or they were not added back to the coordinates after computing the difference.

Additionally, some objects seem to have lost part of their connected components during the coordinate adjustments. For example, Object\_1 has three pixels in row 1, but the test output contains only two pixels in the same location. This inconsistency suggests that the transformation may not preserve the shape and position of objects accurately.

Given these discrepancies, I would rate the quality of the test output as 3 out of 10. It does capture some aspects of the expected result, like the number of objects and their respective dimensions, but fails considerably when preserving the relationship between objects and their actual positions in the input grid.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the transformation steps:

Transformation Steps:
1. Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.
3. Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.
4. Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).

Test Output Analysis:

1. All objects in the input grid are identified correctly, including their colors, coordinates, and sizes.
2. The color, coordinates, and size of each object remain unchanged from the input grid, matching step 2 of the transformation steps.
3. For adjusting the coordinates, we find the minimum x-coordinate for each object and subtract it from the x-coordinates of each point in the object. In this example, the minimum x-coordinate for all objects is 0, so no change is required for the x-coordinates.
4. Similarly, we repeat step 3 for the y-coordinates. Again, since the minimum y-coordinate for all objects is 1, no change is required for the y-coordinates.

Based on the above analysis, here's the output in JSON format:
```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "All transformation steps were followed correctly, resulting in the correct adjusted coordinates for each object in the output grid.",
    "value": 10
}

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the transformation steps, the task involves identifying objects in the input grid and adjusting their coordinates by finding the minimum x and y-coordinates among each object's coordinates and subtracting these values from each x and y-coordinate respectively.

Applying these steps to the test case input grid yields the following adjusted coordinates for the objects:

Object\_1: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]],'size': 3}`
Object\_2: `{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 0]],'size': 1}`
Object\_3: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]],'size': 3}`
Object\_4: `{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[7, 1], [8, 1]],'size': 2}`
Object\_5: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 2], [4, 2], [5, 2], [6, 2]],'size': 7}`
Object\_6: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3]],'size': 6}`
Object\_7: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4]],'size': 4}`
Object\_8: `{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[5, 4], [6, 4]],'size': 2}`
Object\_9: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [6, 5]],'size': 7}`
Object\_10: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [1, 6], [2, 6], [3, 6]],'size': 4}`
Object\_11: `{'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 7]],'size': 3}`
Object\_12: `{'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 7], [5, 7]],'size': 4}`

Comparing these results to the provided test output grid reveals discrepancies in the coordinates of several objects, specifically Object\_2, Object\_4, Object\_8, and Object\_12. It appears that the test output grid does not follow the specified transformation rules accurately. Therefore, I would rate the accuracy of the test output grid as 5 out of 10.
------
 Based on the provided information, I will evaluate the given test output grid by analyzing whether the transformation steps were correctly applied to the test input grid. Here are the transformation steps:

1. Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.
3. Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.
4. Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).

Now let's analyze the given test input and output grids against these steps:

1. All objects in the input grid seem to be correctly identified.
2. Each object has the correct color and size in both the input and output grids.

Let's focus specifically on Object\_2 and Object\_4 to see if any adjustments occurred correctly:

Original Object\_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[9, 1]],'size': 1}
Output Object\_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[0, 1]],'size': 1}

Observed shift in x-coordinate from 9 to 0.

Original Object\_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[8, 2], [9, 2]],'size': 2}
Output Object\_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[7, 2], [8, 2]],'size': 2}

Observed shift in x-coordinate from 8 to 7 and 9 to 8.

Since we observe shifts in the x-coordinates for Object\_2 and Object\_4, it seems like Step 3 was incorrectly executed for the x-coordinate because the minimum x-coordinate was not used for offsetting. Now let's look at the y-coordinates (column indices):

For all objects, we don't notice any discrepancies in the y-coordinates. This suggests that Step 4 was appropriately performed for the y-coordinate. However, since the x-coordinate adjustments were wrong, we cannot say that the whole transformation process was carried out accurately.

After conducting a thorough evaluation, I am unable to provide a numerical rating due to the inconsistencies found in the application of the transformation steps to the x-coordinates.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

transformation steps: [     {'step': 'Identify all objects in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.', 'type': 'processing'},     {'step': 'Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.', 'type': 'adjustment'},     {'step': 'Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).', 'type': 'adjustment'}   ]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [10, 10], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]], 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[9, 1]], 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2]], 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[8, 2], [9, 2]], 'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3]], 'size': 7}, Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]], 'size': 6}, Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5]], 'size': 4}, Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[8, 5], [9, 5]], 'size': 2}, Object_9: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [1, 6], [2, 6], [3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 6]], 'size': 7}, Object_10: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 7], [3, 7]], 'size': 4}, Object_11: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 8], [1, 8], [2, 8]], 'size': 3}, Object_12: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[6, 8], [7, 8], [8, 8], [9, 8]], 'size': 4}

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided transformation steps, I will evaluate the test output against the test input.

Transformation Step 1: Identify all objects in the input grid.

The test input has 12 objects identified correctly.

Transformation Step 2: Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid.

The test output shows that the color, coordinates, and size of each object remain unchanged compared to the test input. This is consistent with the expected outcome.

Transformation Step 3: Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate.

In the test input, the minimum x-coordinate for Object\_1 is 0, for Object\_2 is 9, for Object\_3 is 0, for Object\_4 is 8, for Object\_5 is 0, for Object\_6 is 0, for Object\_7 is 0, for Object\_8 is 8, for Object\_9 is 0, for Object\_10 is 0, for Object\_11 is 0, and for Object\_12 is 6. Based on these minima, we see the following adjustments in the test output:

* Object\_1: [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]] remains unchanged since the minimum x-coordinate is already 0.
* Object\_2: [[0, 1]] remains unchanged since the minimum x-coordinate is already 0.
* Object\_3: [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2]] remains unchanged since the minimum x-coordinate is already 0.

However, other objects do not follow this rule:

* Object\_4: [[-1, 2], [0, 2]] instead of [[0, 2], [1, 2]]
* Object\_5: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3]] remains unchanged even though the minimum x-coordinate should result in [[-6, 3], [-5, 3],..., [-1, 3], [0, 3]].
* Object\_6: [[-1, 4], [0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4]] instead of [[0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]].
* Object\_7: [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5]] remains unchanged even though the minimum x-coordinate should result in [[-3, 5], [-2, 5], [-1, 5], [0, 5]].

There seems to be an issue calculating the adjusted coordinates based on the minimum x-coordinate.

Transformation Step 4: Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index).

Due to errors detected in the previous step, evaluating this step cannot proceed accurately.

Given the problems found during the evaluation, I would rate the accuracy of the provided test output as 3 out of 10 because only some aspects (two out of four steps) of the outputs match expectations, while others contain significant discrepancies related to the rules specified in the transformation steps.
------
 Based on the provided information, here's the analysis of the test output:

1. Identify all objects in the input grid: This step has been correctly applied. All objects in the input grid have been identified.

2. Retain the color, coordinates, and size of each object as it appears in the input grid: This step has been correctly applied. Each object in the output grid matches the corresponding object in the input grid in terms of color, coordinates, and size.

3. Adjust the coordinates of each object by finding the minimum x-coordinate among its coordinates and subtracting this value from each x-coordinate: This step does not seem to have been correctly applied. For example, Object_1 in the output still has x-coordinates of 0, 1, and 2, but the minimum x-coordinate is 0, so no adjustment should be made.

4. Repeat the previous step for the y-coordinate (column index): This step does not seem to have been correctly applied for the same reason as the previous step.

Based on the above analysis, the test output seems to have correctly applied the first two steps but did not correctly apply the last two steps related to coordinate adjustments. Therefore, I would rate the test output as 6 out of 10.#############################

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, it is impossible to evaluate the test output grid because no potential test output grid has been given.

However, I will provide some general observations about the transformation pattern and how it could be applied to a test input grid:

* The transformation pattern appears to involve some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, such as rotation, scaling, shearing, or reflection, followed by translation.
* The specific transformation rules seem to depend on the position, size, and color of the objects in the input grid.
* To determine whether the test output grid is correct, one would need to apply the transformation steps to the test input grid and compare the result to the test output grid.
* Since no transformation steps have been provided, it is not possible to perform this comparison.

Therefore, I cannot provide a rating for the test output grid without additional information.

Here is the JSON response:
```json
{
  "test_output_analysis": "It is impossible to evaluate the test output grid because no potential test output grid has been given.",
  "value": null

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.


transformation steps: None

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, it is not possible to evaluate the correctness of the test output because no test output has been provided. However, I will provide some general observations about the input and the transformation steps.

First, let's define some terminology:

* An object is a connected component of pixels with the same color.
* The size of an object is the number of pixels it contains.
* We will call two objects neighbors if they share at least one common edge.

Overall pattern:
----------------

Based on the examples, we can make some high-level observations about the overall pattern:

1. Objects do not change their color during the transformation process.
2. Objects retain their connectivity throughout the transformation process. In other words, touching objects remain touching after the transformation.
3. There seems to be some sort of periodic boundary condition along both dimensions, meaning that certain columns (or rows) of the input grid get shifted or wrapped around to form the output grid.
4. Some objects appear to flip vertically or horizontally.
5. Most objects maintain their size during the transformation. However, there are cases where small objects disappear while larger objects split into smaller ones. This suggests that some kind of threshold is used to determine whether an object gets preserved or merged with neighboring objects.

Transformation Steps:
--------------------

Since no specific transformation steps have been provided, here are some suggestions based on the observations made earlier:

1. Identify unique objects based on their color and detect any duplicate objects caused by periodic boundaries. For example, if objects reach beyond the right edge of the grid, they could be duplicated on the left side of the grid, possibly flipped horizontally.
2. Check if any pair of objects are neighbors. If so, compare their sizes. Small objects tend to merge with their larger neighbor unless they are separated by multiple layers of large objects.
3. Determine if each object needs to be flipped horizontally or vertically. This appears to depend on the location of the object center relative to the horizontal or vertical axis passing through the center of the grid.
4. Perform periodic boundary shifts based on the overall pattern observed in the examples. It appears that objects located near the edges of the grid get shifted horizontally or vertically depending on the direction of the shift.

Now, assuming we had a test output, here's how you would structure the JSON response:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.\n\nStep 1: Identify unique objects and handle duplicates due to periodic boundary conditions.\nStep 2: Merge small objects with larger ones when appropriate.\nStep 3: Flip objects horizontally or vertically if necessary.\nStep 4: Apply periodic boundary shifts.",
    "value": 7
}
```

Please note that I cannot provide a numerical value without an actual test output to compare against.
------
 Based on the provided information, I will perform an analysis of the given test output grid. However, since no test output grid has been provided, I am unable to proceed with the evaluation. Below is the response in JSON format:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "An input-output pair is required to evaluate the correct application of transformation steps.",
    "value": -1
}
```

Please provide the missing test output grid so I can perform the analysis and rate the transformation's correctness between 0 and 10.
###########################################################
Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: based on the above examples, we can hypothesize that the underlying pattern involves some form of periodic boundary conditions and matrix transformations, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection, followed by translation; there may also be conditions related to the position, size, or color of the objects; more data or analytical methods may be needed to fully characterize the pattern and derive a complete set of rules governing the transformation of the input objects to the output.
overall pattern: given an input consisting of N objects with alternating colors arranged in various configurations, the following steps produce the corresponding output: step 1: apply a matrix transformation to each object, including rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection based on its size and position; step 2: translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color; step 3: repeat step 1 and step 2 until a stable configuration is reached; the result is the desired output.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, it's difficult to perform a thorough evaluation since the transformation steps are missing. However, I will still provide an analysis based on the available data and the overall pattern.

First, let's identify the objects in the test case:

1. Object_1: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 1]],'size': 3}
2. Object_2: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[9, 1]],'size': 1}
3. Object_3: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 2]],'size': 3}
4. Object_4: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[8, 2], [9, 2]],'size': 2}
5. Object_5: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3]],'size': 7}
6. Object_6: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 4], [5, 4]],'size': 6}
7. Object_7: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 5], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5]],'size': 4}
8. Object_8: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[8, 5], [9, 5]],'size': 2}
9. Object_9: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 6], [1, 6], [2, 6], [3, 6], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 6]],'size': 7}
10. Object_10: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 7], [3, 7]],'size': 4}
11. Object_11: {'color': 3, 'coordinates': [[0, 8], [1, 8], [2, 8]],'size': 3}
12. Object_12: {'color': 7, 'coordinates': [[6, 8], [7, 8], [8, 8], [9, 8]],'size': 4}

Now, applying the overall pattern with the assumption that no specific transformation steps are provided:

Step 1 - Matrix Transformation (rotation, scaling, shear, reflection): Since the transformation steps are unknown, I'll assume no change has occurred during this step.

Step 2 - Periodic Boundary Conditions (translation): Again, without specific transformation steps, I cannot accurately predict how the objects would move. So, assuming no movement due to boundary conditions.

Since there are no changes detected after going through the two steps mentioned earlier, the expected output should resemble the input closely. Unfortunately, since the actual output isn't provided, it's impossible to determine whether the application of these generalized steps resulted in correct output generation. As such, providing a numeric value for the quality of the output compared to a reference implementation is challenging.

I hope this helps, but please make sure to provide the transformation steps for future evaluations.
------
 Based on the provided information, I cannot perform an evaluation because no test output grid was given for the test input grid. However, I will provide a general guidance on how to approach this problem. In order to evaluate whether the test input grid has been correctly transformed into its output grid, you need to compare the transformed test input grid against the given test output grid, assuming it exists, and check if they match pixel by pixel. If they do, then the transformation steps were most likely applied correctly. Additionally, keep in mind to consider the overall pattern and the specific transformation steps (even though none were provided) while performing the evaluation.

To proceed with the assessment, please provide the missing test output grid so an accurate evaluation can be carried out accordingly.
###########################################################
Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: 3, coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates: [row_index, column_index].

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the input and output grids of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input grid into its output grid.
Moreover, you are given a test input grid and a potential test output grid.

Evaluate the given test output grid and analyze if the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each transformation step and analyze if the test input grid was correctly transformed into its test output grid.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, it's difficult to perform a thorough analysis without the actual test output grid and the list of detailed transformation steps. However, I will provide an analysis based on the overall pattern and the example inputs/outputs.

Firstly, let's consider the overall pattern:

1. Apply a matrix transformation (rotation, scaling, shear, or reflection) to each object based on its size and position.
2. Translate the resulting objects according to a set of periodic boundary conditions determined by their position and color.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until a stable configuration is reached.

Unfortunately, I don't have the specific transformation steps for the test case. Nevertheless, I can still point out potential issues in the test output grid if provided.

Since I do not have the test output grid and cannot evaluate the correctness of the transformation, I will assume the role of providing feedback on how to assess the transformation instead. To evaluate whether the transformation steps were applied correctly to the test input grid, follow these steps:

1. Identify each object in the input grid regarding its color, coordinates, and size.
2. Manually apply the overall pattern transformation steps to each object, keeping track of any changes to the object's properties.
3. Compare the transformed objects against the provided test output grid. Make sure that each object's final position, size, and color match those in the test output grid.
4. Check for consistency in the application of periodic boundary conditions. Verify that the translated positions of objects align with the expected patterns.

Once you have performed these checks, rate the test output accordingly, keeping in mind that a perfect match would warrant a score of 10 while partial matches or incorrect applications could receive lower scores depending on the severity and number of discrepancies.

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Let's assume the following transformation steps (based on the overall pattern):
1. Rotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Reflect the grid along the vertical axis (x=5).

Applying these transformations results in the following output grid:
```less
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
However, without the exact transformation steps provided, this assessment is speculative. If these assumed transformation steps match the unspecified ones, the **test output would receive a score of 10**. Otherwise, additional context and explicit transformation steps need to be provided before accurately evaluating the test output grid.
