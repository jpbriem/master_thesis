The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change?

a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The change in object color seems to be determined by the position of the object, as objects that remained unchanged did so regardless of their color, while the objects that changed color did so based on their position.\noverall pattern: Objects at certain positions tend to change color, while the rest of the objects remain unchanged. The change in color is not dependent on the size or color of other objects.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the positions of the objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the specific positions at which the objects change color in the output sequence based on the overall pattern.', 'For each input object, check if its position matches any of the specific positions identified in the previous step.', 'If the position matches, change the color of the object in the output sequence. If the position does not match, keep the color of the object unchanged in the output sequence.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 17]\ntransformed objects: {'Object_1': {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, 'Object_2': {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}"
