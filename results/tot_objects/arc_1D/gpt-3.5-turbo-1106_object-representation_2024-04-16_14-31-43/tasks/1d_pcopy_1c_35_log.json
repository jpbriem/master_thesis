The transformation seems to be based on the color of the objects and their position within the sequence.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes, as they specify how the size and indices of the objects change based on their color.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output by specifying how the size, start_index, and end_index change for objects with specific colors.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it clearly defines the changes based on object color and position within the sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes, as they specify how the size and indices of the objects change based on their color.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output by specifying how the size, start_index, and end_index change for objects with specific colors.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it clearly defines the changes based on object color and position within the sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes, as they specify how the size and indices of the objects change based on their color.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output by specifying how the size, start_index, and end_index change for objects with specific colors.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it clearly defines the changes based on object color and position within the sequence.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"7\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  }\n}"
