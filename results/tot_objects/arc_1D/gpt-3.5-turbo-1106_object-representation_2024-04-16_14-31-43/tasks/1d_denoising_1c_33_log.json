For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 11}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 11}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The condition for the change in objects is based on the color and properties of the objects in the input. The number of objects with certain colors, their sizes, and positions determine the changes in the output.\noverall pattern: The general rule for transforming the input to the output is to consider the objects with specific colors, their sizes, and positions. The transformation involves either reducing the number of objects with a specific color or modifying the properties of specific objects to match certain criteria.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects with specific colors in the input.', 'If there are multiple objects with the same color, determine the criteria for selecting the object to be retained in the output. This could involve choosing the object with the largest size, the object at a specific position, or any other specified criterion.', 'If the number of objects with a specific color needs to be reduced, remove the extra objects based on the specified criteria.', 'If the properties of the objects need to be modified, such as the size or position, adjust the objects accordingly to match the specified criteria in the output.', 'Repeat the above steps for each color as necessary to achieve the desired output.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.
