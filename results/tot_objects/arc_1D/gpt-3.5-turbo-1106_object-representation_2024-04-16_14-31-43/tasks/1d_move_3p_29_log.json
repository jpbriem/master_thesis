The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 6}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The position of Object_1 changes by adding 3 to both start_index and end_index.\noverall pattern: The start_index and end_index of Object_1 consistently increase by 3 from input to output.\n\n\ntransformation steps: 1. Identify the start_index and end_index of Object_1 in the input sequence. 2. Add 3 to the start_index and end_index of Object_1 to obtain the corresponding values in the output sequence.\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}\noutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 10]\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
