There might be a condition related to the overall structure or specific object positions in the input sequence that triggers this shift.\noverall pattern: The position of Object_1 consistently shifts by +3 indices in the output compared to the input, while the color and size of the object remain the same. This pattern indicates a consistent transformation rule applied to the position of Object_1. The underlying rule seems to involve shifting the position of Object_1 by +3 indices in the output.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the second example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the second example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the third example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the third example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  }\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
