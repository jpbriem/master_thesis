For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 17}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The position change of the objects seems to be determined by the specific color of the object, as the start and end indices change while the size remains the same.\noverall pattern: The start and end indices of the objects appear to shift by a fixed value based on the color of the object. Specifically, the start_index and end_index both increased by 3 for objects with specific colors.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  }\n}"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.
