The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformed objects maintain their original center positions and colors, as required.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"The test output has been analyzed according to the given transformation rules. Object_1 in the input sequence is already 3 pixels in size, so according to the rules, it should remain unchanged in the output, which it does. Object_2 and Object_3 in the input sequence are each 1 pixel in size, and according to the transformation rules, they should expand to 3 pixels by adding one pixel to the left and one to the right while maintaining their original center position. In the output, Object_2 correctly starts at index 7 and ends at index 9, with the original pixel at index 8 remaining at the center. Similarly, Object_3 correctly starts at index 11 and ends at index 13, with the original pixel at index 12 remaining at the center. The output sequence follows the transformation pattern correctly for each object, maintaining the sequence dimension, color consistency, and the correct transformed object sizes and positions.\",\n    \"value\": 10\n}"
