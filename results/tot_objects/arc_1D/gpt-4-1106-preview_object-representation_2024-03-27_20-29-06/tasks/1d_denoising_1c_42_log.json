The test input shows four objects of color 3, with sizes 15, 1, 1, and 1. Following the overall pattern, only the object with the largest size should be kept. In this case, it is Object_1 with a size of 15. The transformation steps dictate that all other objects should be removed and replaced by the background color. The test output should therefore have only Object_1 from start_index 1 to end_index 15 with color 3, and the rest of the sequence should be filled with the background color 0.\",\n  \"value\": \"Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.\"\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n#####\nsystem:\n#####\n\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
