You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 11}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 11}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}

overall pattern:
conditions: Only the largest object in the sequence is kept; all other objects are removed regardless of their color or position
overall pattern: Identify the largest object by size, remove all other objects, and leave the largest object unchanged in its original position with its original color and size



transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects and their sizes', 'Determine the largest object based on the size attribute of each object', 'Create a new output sequence of the same dimension as the input sequence filled with background pixels (0s)', 'Copy the largest object identified earlier into the corresponding position in the new output sequence, preserving its color and size', 'All other objects are not copied, effectively removing them from the output sequence']

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 12}

overall pattern:
conditions: objects with a size of 1 pixel are removed
overall pattern: identify all objects, remove any object that has a size of 1 pixel, leave larger objects unchanged


transformation steps: ['1. Identify all objects in the input sequence.', '2. For each object, check the size of the object.', '3. If an object size is 1 pixel, remove that object from the sequence.', '4. Leave all other objects (size greater than 1 pixel) unchanged in their original positions with their original colors.']

The second step is to check the size of each object. Object_1, Object_3, and Object_4 are single-pixel objects with a size of 1, while Object_2 is a larger object with a size of 10 pixels. The third step is to remove any object that has a size of 1 pixel. Accordingly, Object_1, Object_3, and Object_4 are removed. The fourth and final step is to leave all other objects unchanged. Therefore, Object_2 remains in the sequence with its original position, color, and size.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects of size 1 change by increasing in size to match the largest object of the same color present in the input and are shifted left by one index.
overall pattern: Identify objects of size 1. Increase their size to match the largest object of the same color in the sequence and move them left by one index. Leave other objects unchanged.


transformation steps: ['Scan the input sequence to identify all objects', 'For each object, check if its size is 1', 'If an object of size 1 is found, search for the largest object of the same color', 'Increase the size of the size 1 object to match that of the largest object of the same color', 'Shift the start and end indices of the size 1 object to the left by 1', 'Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each object of size 1', 'Leave all other objects unchanged', 'Construct the output sequence based on the modified objects']


Test case:

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects are moved to the right by a number of positions equal to their size minus one, regardless of their initial position, color, or the total sequence size.
overall pattern: For any input sequence, identify each object and move it to the right by a number of positions equal to its size minus one, without altering the color or size of the object. The sequence dimension remains the same.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with size equal to 4 or greater than 5 change color
overall pattern: If an object's size is 4 or greater than 5, recolor the object to color 7, else keep original color


transformation steps: ['Identify each object within the input sequence', 'For each object, check if the size is exactly 4 or greater than 5', "If the object size condition is met, change the object's color to 7", 'If the object size condition is not met, retain the original color of the object', "Maintain the objects' original positions within the sequence"]

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input, based on object colors, positions, and sizes, that determine the changes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

#####

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input, based on object colors, positions, and sizes, that determine the changes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation condition appears to be changing the color of specific objects from 1 to 6 while keeping other objects unchanged.
overall pattern: Objects with the original color of 1 are transformed into the color 6, while other objects remain unchanged in color, position, and size.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the color 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object with the color 1, change the color to 6 in the output sequence while keeping the position and size unchanged.', 'Leave all other objects in the output sequence unchanged in terms of color, position, and size.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation condition appears to be changing the color of specific objects from 1 to 6 while keeping other objects unchanged.
overall pattern: Objects with the original color of 1 are transformed into the color 6, while other objects remain unchanged in color, position, and size.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the color 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object with the color 1, change the color to 6 in the output sequence while keeping the position and size unchanged.', 'Leave all other objects in the output sequence unchanged in terms of color, position, and size.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: The transformation condition appears to be changing the color of specific objects from 1 to 6 while keeping other objects unchanged.
overall pattern: Objects with the original color of 1 are transformed into the color 6, while other objects remain unchanged in color, position, and size.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the color 1 in the input sequence.', 'For each identified object with the color 1, change the color to 6 in the output sequence while keeping the position and size unchanged.', 'Leave all other objects in the output sequence unchanged in terms of color, position, and size.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 30], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 7}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change?

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input, based on object colors, positions, and sizes, that determine the changes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input, based on object colors, positions, and sizes, that determine the changes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with the same color were removed in the output if their start_index and end_index were not within the range of start_index and end_index of the remaining object with the same color.
overall pattern: Objects with the same color are transformed by removing those whose start_index and end_index are not within the range of the remaining object with the same color. The position and size of the remaining object might change in the output.



transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with the same color in the input sequence.', 'For each group of objects with the same color, compare their start_index and end_index to find the range that covers all the objects with the same color.', 'Remove the objects with the same color that are not within the identified range.', 'Adjust the start_index and end_index of the remaining object with the same color to cover the entire range of the group.', 'The size of the remaining object may change in the output due to the removal of other objects with the same color.']

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, it can be observed that the position of an object, specifically Object_2, may depend on some rule involving the proximity to or number of adjacent objects. Further investigation would help define more accurate conditions determining the position changes.
overall pattern: To derive a general rule for transforming an input into an output, we need to examine how the size of objects relates to their positioning. In addition, studying the relationship between multiple objects could contribute to defining better conditions for changes in their properties.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, various conditions apply leading to changes in objects:

1. When a noise pixel exists beside the end index of an object, the object increases its end index and size.
2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.

2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

 Based on the given input, here's the description of the objects present in the input:
{'input_description': 'There are four objects with color 4 in the input. Object 1 has a size of 3 and covers the indices from 1 to 3. Object 2, 3, and 4 have a size of 1 and cover index 8 for Object 2, index 12 for Object 3, and index 18 for Object 4 respectively.'}

Applying the provided transformation steps yields the following result:
{'transformation': 'First, the objects are identified and sorted by color, resulting in four objects of color 4 being considered. Then, the spacing between adjacent objects of the same color is analyzed and adjusted to achieve a uniform distribution across the sequence.

Finally, smaller objects are merged with neighboring noise pixels if they don't conflict with previous merging rules. This results in Object 2 growing to size 3 (indices 7-9), Object 3 remaining unchanged at size 1 (index 12), and a new Object 5 forming out of Object 4 and some neighboring noise pixels, having a size of 3 (indices 17-19).'}

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, various conditions apply leading to changes in objects:

1. When a noise pixel exists beside the end index of an object, the object increases its end index and size.
2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.


transformation steps: [{'step': '1', 'description': 'Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input.'}, {'step': '2', 'description': 'For each object, check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object (i.e., at the end_index).

 Based on the given examples, overall pattern, transformation steps, and test case, let's evaluate the test output:

First, let's compare the input and output dimensions, which both are [1, 32]. This part is correct.

Now, let's look at the objects and their properties:

Original Input Objects:
1. Color: 4; Start Index: 1; End Index: 3; Size: 3
2. Color: 4; Start Index: 8; End Index: 8; Size: 1
3. Color: 4; Start Index: 12; End Index: 12; Size: 1
4. Color: 4; Start Index: 18; End Index: 18; Size: 1

Transformed Output Objects:
1. Color: 4; Start Index: 1; End Index: 3; Size: 3
2. Color: 4; Start Index: 6; End Index: 8; Size: 3 (Adjusted)
3. Color: 4; Start Index: 11; End Index: 13; Size: 3 (Adjusted)
4. Color: 4; Start Index: 17; End Index: 19; Size: 3 (Adjusted)

We notice that the objects sharing the same color have their start and end indices adjusted to distribute them more evenly throughout the sequence. Also, the sizes of the objects remain constant (except for Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4, whose sizes increased due to merging with neighboring noise pixels). All these changes comply with the overall pattern provided. Therefore, it seems like the transformation follows the given instructions accurately.

However, there is still one missing piece of information – what is the required object size? Without this detail, it is impossible to fully determine if the merged objects meet the criteria specified in the last transformation step. If we assume the required object size is 3, then the test output has been applied correctly based on the information available. Nonetheless, additional context about the required object size would make the evaluation more precise.

As a result, my response would be:
{
  "test\_output\_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input appears to be correctly transformed into its output. However, without full knowledge of the required object size, I cannot definitively confirm compliance with the final transformation step.",
  "value": "8"

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input according to the given transformation steps and overall pattern.

First, let's go through each of the transformation steps:

1. **Identify all objects in the input.** - Passed. In the test output, all objects were identified correctly.
2. **Sort objects by color.** - Not applicable since there is only one color (4) present in this example.
3. **Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.**
   * Before: [1, 3], [8, 8], [12, 12], [18, 18]
   * After: [1, 6], [8, 8], [12, 12], [18, 18] - Failed. Only the first object has been expanded. Other objects did not change their indices.
4. **Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.**
   * Before: [3], [1], [1], [1]
   * After: [5], [1], [1], [1] - Partially passed. Although the size of the first object changed, it's still expected to be adjusted to match the size of other objects of the same color.
5. **Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.** - Not applicable in this case since there are no other noise pixels around objects to merge.

Now, based on the above analysis, although some aspects of the transformation were followed, there are discrepancies compared to the expected overall pattern and specific transformation steps. Thus, I would rate the test output as follows:

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation instructions, the test input was not completely transformed into the expected output. Step 3 was only partially applied, while step 4 showed changes but might still need further refinement depending on the expected final result.', 'value': '5'}
------
 Based on the given problem statement, let's evaluate the test output by considering each transformation step.

1. **Identify all objects in the input.**
   - It seems that the test output has identified four objects of color 4. This is consistent with the input.

2. **Sort objects by color.**
   - Since there is only one color present in both the input and the output, this condition does not need to be checked.

3. **Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.**
   - In the test output, the first object now extends from index 1 to 6 (inclusive), covering the positions initially occupied by the second and third objects in the input. While it ensures an even distribution, it may not necessarily be correct since merging two or more objects of the same color might not always result in combining their indices linearly.

4. **Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.**
   - According to the test output, there is one remaining object after the first object has been extended. However, no information about the location or size of this object has been provided. Therefore, it's impossible to say for sure if all the objects match in terms of their size.

5. **Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.**
   - As mentioned before, while the first object has merged the second and third objects from the original input, it remains unclear if these merges were valid based on the constraints presented in step 3.

Since some important details regarding the final outcome are missing, I would rate the test output as 5 out of 10 due to ambiguity. If complete and accurate information had been available for all affected objects, then further assessment could lead to a higher rating.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the input-output patterns provided, the transformation appears to involve adjusting the start and end indices of objects of the same color to create a more uniform distribution across the input sequence, while also attempting to make the sizes of those objects more consistent. However, without a specific proposed output for the test case, it's impossible to evaluate whether the transformation has been applied correctly.

Therefore, I am unable to provide a numerical rating for the test output, as there is no test output to evaluate. If a specific proposed output were provided, I would be happy to reevaluate based on that information.

 Based on the provided information, the transformation steps appear to involve identifying objects in the input sequence, sorting them by color, adjusting the spacing between objects of the same color, checking object sizes, and merging smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels if possible. However, there is no test output provided for the given test input. Therefore, I am unable to evaluate and analyze the application of the transformation to the test input.

To provide an analysis and rating for the test output, I would need the actual test output generated by applying the transformation to the test input. Once I have that information, I can assess how well the transformation was applied and provide a rating based on that assessment.

3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output:

Input:
Dimension: [1, 32], Object\_1: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 3,'size': 3}, Object\_2: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 8,'size': 1}, Object\_3: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 12, 'end\_index': 12,'size': 1}, Object\_4: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 18, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 1}

Output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32],
transformed objects: Object 1: {color: 4, start\_index: 1, end\_index: 5, size: 5}, Object 2: {color: 4, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 11, size: 4}, Object 3: {color: 4, start\_index: 12, end\_index: 13, size: 2}, Object 4: {color: 4, start\_index: 18, end\_index: 19, size: 2}

Now we will consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze whether the test input was correctly transformed into its output:

Step 1: Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input. This step seems to be a preparatory step and doesn't affect the output directly. It's assumed to be done correctly.

Step 2: Check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object (i.e., at the end\_index). Update the end\_index and size of the object by adding the number of consecutive noise pixels found.

* Object 1 has end\_index = 3 initially and finds two consecutive noise pixels (0) to its right; hence, it becomes end\_index = 5 with a size increase to 5.
* Object 2 has end\_index = 8 initially and finds three consecutive noise pixels (0) to its right; hence, it becomes end\_index = 11 with a size increase to 4.
* Object 3 has end\_index = 12 initially and finds one consecutive noise pixel (0) to its right; hence, it becomes end\_index = 13 with a size increase to 2.
* Object 4 has end\_index = 18 initially and does not find any consecutive noise pixels (0) to its right; therefore, it remains unchanged with end\_index = 18 and a size of 1.

This step appears to be executed accurately according to the rules described.

Step 3: Make relevant adjustments to the updated end\_index and size based on factors such as the starting index, possible interactions with nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances. While this description is somewhat vague and lacks specificity, comparing the example outputs suggests that no further modifications were required beyond Step 2. Since the current test output matches expected results derived from applying Steps 1 & 2, it implies that Step 3 may not even be necessary when following those guidelines.

Given the above analysis, our judgment is as follows:

{"test\_output\_analysis": "The test output appears to be correct after analyzing each step of the transformation instructions.", "value": "10"}
------
 {
  'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation instructions, let us analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output:\n\nStep 1: Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input - This step seems to have been followed correctly.\nStep 2: For each object, check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object (i.e., at the end\_index). Update the end\_index and size of the object by adding the number of consecutive noise pixels found. - This step appears to have been executed mostly correctly, but there might be some inconsistencies in updating the end\_index and size for certain objects. For instance, Object 3 has an end\_index of 13 instead of 12, which could be due to misinterpretation of the pattern.\nStep 3: Make relevant adjustments to the updated end\_index and size based on factors like the starting index, possible interactions with nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances - It is unclear whether this step has been implemented accurately since there is no clear rule provided for making these adjustments, and the results seem somewhat arbitrary. There also does not appear to be any consideration given to the starting index or interactions with nearby objects.',

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 18}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}

 Here is the JSON format response:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "object_number": "no change",
    "object_analysis": "the object's color remains the same (3), but its position shifts right by 3 units",
    "conditions": "when an object has a size greater than or equal to 5 and starts at index 1, shift its starting position to the right by 3 units"

  },
  "Example_3": {
    "object_number": "no change",
    "object_analysis": "the object's color remains the same (1), but its position shifts right by 3 units",
    "conditions": "when an object starts at index 3 and has a size of exactly 4, shift its starting position to the right by 3 units"
  },
  "overall_pattern": {
    "conditions": "when an object's size meets the specified criteria and starts at a particular index, shift its starting position to the right by 3 units while keeping its color and size constant",
    "overall_pattern": "for each object, check if its size and starting index meet the stated conditions; if yes, shift its starting position to the right by 3 units, otherwise keep the original object intact."
  }
}
```

 Here is the JSON format response to your question:
```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "object_number": "no change",
    "object_analysis": "the color (3) and size (18) of the object remain the same, but its starting index changes from 1 to 4 and ending index changes from 18 to 21.",
    "conditions": "when an object's starting index is less than or equal to 4, its starting index increases by 3."
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "object_number": "no change",
    "object_analysis": "the color (5) and size (4) of the object remain the same, but its starting index changes from 16 to 19 and ending index changes from 19 to 22.",
    "conditions": "when an object's starting index is greater than or equal to 16, its starting index increases by 3."
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "object_number": "no change",
    "object_analysis": "the color (1) and size (4) of the object remain the same, but its starting index changes from 3 to 6 and ending index changes from 6 to 9.",
    "conditions": "when an object's starting index is less than or equal to 6, its starting index increases by 3."
  },
  "overall_pattern": {
    "conditions": "for any given object, when its starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, its starting index increases by 3, leaving the size and color unchanged.",
    "overall_pattern": "given an input sequence with one object, increase the starting index by 3 if the starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, keeping the size and color constant."
  }
}
```
In this case, we observe that the pattern involves shifting the starting and ending indices of each object based on their initial position. If the starting index is less than or equal to 4, then it gets increased by 3; otherwise, if the starting index is greater than or equal to 16, it again gets increased by 3. This shift does not affect the size or color of the object and ensures that there are no overlaps.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 18}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}


overall pattern:
conditions: an object may change position based on its starting position and size. If an object starts before index 17, it will move right by a number of units depending on its size.
overall pattern: If an object starts before index 17, then check its size. If its size equals 1, it moves right by two units; otherwise, it moves right by two units plus one.

Value Outputs:
 Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given conditions only refer to the input, specifically the starting position and size of an object. These conditions are also relevant to determining the object changes, since they directly affect whether or not an object will move.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The given overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output for the first example. It accurately states that if an object starts before index 17, it will move right based on its size.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output for the first example. However, it assumes that the output will always have the same dimensions as the input, which may not be the case for all examples.",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": 9
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": 9
  }
}
```

Overall, the given pattern accurately describes the transformation from input to output for all three examples. However, there are some potential issues with precision. Specifically, the pattern assumes that the output will always have the same dimensions as the input, which may not be true for all cases. Additionally, the pattern does not account for the possibility of multiple objects in the input, so it would need to be modified slightly to handle such cases.

 Here is the JSON response regarding the given examples and the overall pattern:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given condition is relevant to the input and determines the object's movement based solely on its starting position and size. However, it lacks specificity about whether other factors might influence the shift.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern accurately describes the transformation for Example_1. It precisely states how an object shifts position when its starting index is less than 17.",
    "precision_analysis": "Yes, the overall pattern is precise enough to predict the outcome for a novel input. Given an object's starting index and size, we can apply the rule to calculate the new ending_index.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern still holds true for this instance. It matches the provided input-output pair.",
    "precision_analysis": "Similar to previous, the overall pattern provides sufficient precision to derive the expected output.",
    "value": 8
  },
  "Example_3": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Same as Examples 1 & 2",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern applies here too. There is no discrepancy observed compared to the given input-output pair.",
    "precision_analysis": "As mentioned earlier, the pattern gives adequate precision to deduce the expected result.",
    "value": 8
  }

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 18}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 18}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 4}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 24], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, objects with a size greater than or equal to 3 undergo a consistent transformation - they maintain their original color while shifting their starting index to the right by a value equal to half of their size minus one. This results in no net change in the number of objects and an altered arrangement of those objects depending upon their initial size.
overall pattern: For every element in the input sequence, check whether the current pixel is part of an existing object with a significant size (greater than or equal to 3). If yes, calculate the adjusted starting index as the original starting index plus half of the object size minus one; adjust the endpoint accordingly (keep the size constant); then update the object information using the newly calculated indices; else keep the current pixel unchanged. Perform these operations sequentially for each pixel until the entire input sequence has been processed.

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here is the transformation for the test case:

```json
{
  "input_description": "The input contains one object (color: 7) with a size of 11 pixels. It starts at index 8 and ends at index 18.",
  "transformation": "For the given object, since the starting index is 8 which is greater than 4 but less than 16, it remains unchanged. So, the object will stay in place and its final position will still be from index 8 to 18 with a size of 11 pixels and color 7.",
  "output": {
    "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 24],
    "transformed_objects": "Object_1: {color: 7, start_index: 8, end_index: 18, size: 11}"
  }
}
```

In this case, the object does not meet the condition mentioned in the overall pattern because its starting index is neither less than or equal to 4 nor greater than or equal to 16. Therefore, the object stays in the same position with no changes made to its size, position, or color.
------
 Based on the given overall pattern and transformation steps, here is the JSON response for the test case:

```json
{
    "input_description": "In the input, there is a single object (color 7) spanning from index 8 to 18, covering a total of 11 positions.",
    "transformation": "Following the provided pattern, since the starting index of the object (8) is greater than 4 but less than 16, the object remains at its original position in the output with no changes applied to its size and color.",
    "output": {
        "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 24],
        "transformed_objects": "{'color': 7,'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 18,'size': 11}"
    }
}
```

Explanation:
Since the `start_index` of the object (color 7) does not meet the condition (less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16), no shifts or modifications need to be applied according to the given overall pattern and transformation steps. Therefore, the object will remain unchanged in the output sequence.
------
 Based on the information provided, here is the expected output for the test case:

```json
{
  "input_description": "In the input, there is one object (color 7) with a starting index of 8, ending index of 18, and size of 11.",
  "transformation": "Following the transformation steps, we iterate through the object and check if the starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. In this case it is neither, so no changes need to be made to the starting index. Therefore, the object in the output will have the same properties as in the input: color 7, starting index 8, ending index 18, and size 11.",
  "output": {
    "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 24],
    "transformed_objects": "Object_1: {'color': 7,'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 18,'size': 11}"
  }
}
```

Note that since the overall pattern specifies conditions that don't apply to the test case input, no changes are necessary to the input object.
------
 Based on the given input, here is the desired output:

```json
{
    "input_description": "In the test input, there is one object (color 7) with a size of 11 pixels, starting at index 8 and ending at index 18.",
    "transformation": "Following the transformation steps, we first iterate through the object(s) in the input sequence. We check if the starting index of the current object (which is 8) is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. In this case, it does not satisfy either condition, so no changes need to be made to the starting index. Therefore, the transformed object will still have a starting index of 8, and an ending index of 18, resulting in a size of 11 pixels. It will retain its original color (color 7).",
    "output": {
        "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 24],

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output:

First, we need to identify if the object in the test input meets the condition for applying the transformation:

* Input object: Color = 7, Start Index = 8, End Index = 18, Size = 11

Since the size of this object is indeed greater than or equal to 3, we can proceed to apply the transformation:

* Calculate the adjusted starting index: Original Starting Index = 8, Object Size = 11
* New Starting Index = 8 + (11/2) - 1 = 12.5 - 1 = 11.5

However, this result indicates that the provided transformation formula may not work as expected since it yields a non-integer value when calculating the new starting index. In practice, such calculations would generally produce integer values due to the discrete nature of the input data. Thus, there might be an issue with the proposed transformation formula.

As a result, providing a clear rating based on the test case is difficult without addressing any discrepancies found in the provided rules and formulae. Nonetheless, considering the inconsistencies mentioned above, I cannot provide a rating higher than 1 for this test output.

To sum up the analysis, here is the JSON response:

{
  "test_output_analysis": "Considering the transformation instructions, the test input does not appear to have been correctly transformed into its test output. There seems to be an issue with the calculation method used to determine new starting indices.",
  "value": 1
}
------
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output:

First, we need to determine if the test output follows the correct dimension and objects structure:

* Test output dimension: [1, 24] - Correct
* Transformed object keys present: ['color','start_index', 'end_index','size'] - Correct

Now, let's analyze if the transformation was applied correctly:

* Input object size: 11
* According to the pattern, the adjusted starting index should be the original starting index plus half of the object size minus one: 8 + (11/2) - 1 = 12
* In the test output, the'start_index' is 13, but it should be 12 based on the calculation
* Additionally, the 'end_index' is 28 instead of the expected 23 (12 + 11), and the'size' is 16 instead of the expected 11

Therefore, there seems to be an issue with the application of the transformation to the test input. Specifically, the'start_index', 'end_index', and'size' do not appear to follow the described pattern.

 Based on the provided information, here's the analysis:

The overall pattern indicates that objects with a size greater than or equal to 3 should shift their starting index to the right by a value equal to half of their size minus one. 

In the test case, the object has a size of 11, so it should shift its starting index to the right by (11/2)-1 = 5. 

The test output shows that the object has started at index 13, which matches the expected calculation. The end index is 23, which maintains the original size of the object (11). 

The transformation steps also align with this operation. They involve checking if the current pixel is part of an existing object with a size greater than or equal to 3, calculating the adjusted starting index, updating the endpoint, and updating the object information. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the test output seems to have applied the transformation correctly to the test input. 

However, it's important to note that without actually seeing the code implementation or the transformed output, this analysis is based solely on the provided information. A more thorough evaluation would require reviewing the actual implementation.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output.

First, we need to determine whether the transformation was applied correctly according to the given steps and the overall pattern. We will go through the transformation steps one by one and compare them to the test output.

1. Initialize an empty list to store updated pixels
   It seems the test output didn't include this intermediate step since it returns the final array instead of the list. But this can still work for our purpose as long as other conditions hold true.
2. Iterate over each pixel in the input sequence
   Since the test output doesn't directly show the iteration process, we have to assume this step happened, but without visual confirmation.
3. Check if the current pixel is part of an existing object with a size >= 3
   In this case, the first affected pixel would be at index 13 (half of the object size minus 1 added to the start\_index). So, the iteration must have identified the correct object and size requirements were met.
4. Calculate the adjusted starting index as the original starting index + (object size / 2) - 1
   
   The adjusted starting index is indeed 14, which matches the test output.
5. Update the endpoint to match the adjusted starting index and maintain the original object size

   The test output shows the end\_index to be 24, compared to the original 18, so 11 pixels remain in the object, meaning the updating step happened properly due to the adjusted starting index being used.
6. Update the object information using the new indices
   The test output includes the updated object information, confirming this step.
7. Keep the current pixel unchanged if it does not belong to any large enough object

   Since there is no indication of extra elements inserted, we can infer that non-affected pixels weren't changed, even though this isn't explicitly shown in the test output.
8. Add the updated pixel to the list

   Although not shown in the test output, assuming this step took place will allow us to proceed with the verification.
9. Return the updated list as the output sequence

   As mentioned earlier, the test output provides the final array instead of a list. However, considering the rest of the matching criteria, we can assume that this is equivalent to the final outcome of iterating over the list.

Based on the above examination, I believe that the transformation was likely applied correctly according to the given rules and patterns. Therefore, my assessment is:

{

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output.

First, let's examine the overall pattern and transformation steps. The pattern suggests that we need to increase the starting index by 3 for any object where the starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. This change will keep the size and color constants.

Now, consider the test input and output:

Test Input: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {color: 7, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 18, size: 11}
Test Output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {color: 7, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 18, size: 11}

According to the transformation rules, since the `start_index` (8) does not meet the condition (less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16), no changes should occur for this specific object in the test input. However, observing the test output, there are no alterations made to the original input regarding the specified object. As a result, it seems like the transformation was not applied to the test input according to the defined pattern and transformation steps.

Therefore, my assessment would look like:

{
'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering the transformation instructions, the test input was NOT correctly transformed into the test output.',

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output.

First, let's look at the overall pattern and transformation steps. The pattern states that for any given object, when its starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, its starting index should increase by 3, leaving the size and color unchanged. The transformation steps involve iterating through each object in the input sequence, checking if the starting index meets the specified conditions, and increasing the starting index by 3 while keeping the size and color constant if the condition is met.

Now, let's examine the test case. The input object has a starting index of 8, which is neither less than or equal to 4 nor greater than or equal to 16. Therefore, according to the overall pattern and transformation steps, the starting index of this object should remain unchanged.

In the test output, however, the starting index of the object remains 8, which contradicts the expected behavior based on the overall pattern and transformation steps. As a result, it appears that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input based on the given rules.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the problem description, we need to evaluate whether the provided test output matches the expected output based on the given overall pattern and the transformation steps. Here, the overall pattern states that for any given object, if its starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, then the starting index should increase by 3 while keeping the size and color constant. Let's analyze the given test input and output.

Input: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

Output:
test case output dimension: [1, 24]
transformed objects: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

According to the input, the object starts at index 8, which satisfies the condition mentioned earlier since it's neither less than or equal to 4 nor greater than or equal to 16. Hence, there will be no change in the starting index, and it should remain at 8 after applying the transformation. However, we notice that the output has preserved the original starting index (8) instead of increasing it by 3. Therefore, this test output does not seem to follow the correct transformation pattern.

Now we can provide the requested output:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
"value": 0
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output according to the transformation pattern and steps.

Firstly, we need to check whether the starting index of the object in the test input meets the condition specified in the pattern. In this case, the `start_index` is 8, which does not meet the condition (less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16). Thus, no change should be made to the `start_index`. However, in the test output, the `start_index` remains unchanged at 8.

According to the transformation pattern and steps, since there is no mention of altering the `start_index` unless it fulfills the given conditions, the correct action would be to keep the `start_index`, `end_index`, and `size` unaltered. Therefore, the test output appears to be incorrect due to the unjustified modification in the `start_index`.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, the test output cannot be considered as correctly transformed according to the provided transformation pattern and steps. A more accurate output would be:

{
  "test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
  "value": 0

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output.

First, we examine the overall pattern, which states that for any given object, when its starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, its starting index increases by 3, leaving the size and color unchanged.

Now, let's look at the transformation steps:

1. Iterate through each object in the input sequence
2. Check if the starting index of the current object is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16
3. If true, increase the starting index by 3, keeping the size and color constant

Applying these steps to our test input:

Input: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

Step 1: We see there is one object in this input sequence, so we proceed to Step 2.

Step 2: The starting index of the object is 8, which does not meet the condition of being less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. Therefore, no changes need to be made according to this pattern. However, it would be helpful to know the expected test output in order to compare and fully evaluate the given test output. Assuming there were no errors in applying the transformation, I will rate the test output based on adherence to the stated rules.

Output: As per the test input itself, the output remains unchanged:
Dimensions: [1, 24]
Transformed objects: Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

Since the provided test output matches the expected (given) result, and there are no apparent discrepancies regarding the application of the provided pattern, I will provide a positive evaluation.

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions, and it appears the test input has been correctly transformed into the test output.",
"value": 10
}
------
 Based on the problem statement and examples provided, we can see that the transformation involves shifting the starting index of any object in the input sequence whose starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, while keeping the size and color of the object unchanged.

Applying this transformation to the test case input, we have:

Input: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

Since the starting index of Object\_1 (which is 8) is neither less than or equal to 4 nor greater than or equal to 16, the transformation does not apply to it. Therefore, the expected output should be identical to the input:

Output: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

However, the actual test case output is:

Output:
test case output dimension: [1, 24]
transformed objects: Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

This matches the original input, indicating that no transformation has been applied. This suggests that there may have been an error in implementing the transformation steps.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the value of the test output would be 0 out of 10, indicating that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output.

First, we need to analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input based on the provided overall pattern and transformation steps.

transformation steps:
1. Iterate through each object in the input sequence
2. Check if the starting index of the current object is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16
3. If true, increase the starting index by 3, keeping the size and color constant

Test case input: Dimension: [1, 24], Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 11}

According to step 1, we iterate through the object in the input sequence. There is only one object in this case.

Step 2 tells us to check if the starting index of the object (which is 8) is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. Since it does not meet either condition, we proceed to the next step without making any changes.

However, since there are no more steps left, the process ends here and the starting index remains unchanged at 8. But according to the overall pattern, the starting index should increase by 3 if the starting index is less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16, resulting in a final value of 11 instead of 8. Therefore, the transformation was not applied correctly.

Now let's provide a rating based on our analysis. A rating of 0 indicates that the test output failed completely while a rating of 10 means it passed perfectly. Considering the fact that the transformation was not applied correctly, a fair rating would be:

'value': 3

This moderate rating reflects the fact that although some parts of the transformation were correct (keeping the size and color constant), it still did not follow the main rule of increasing the starting index by 3 under specific conditions. Here is the full JSON response:

{
'test\_output\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output. The starting index of the object should have increased by 3 if the starting index was less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. However, this change was not made in the test output, so the transformation was not applied correctly.',
'value': 3
}
------
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output:

1. The dimensions of both the input and output sequences match ([1, 24]), which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. There is only one object in the input and output sequences, and they have the same color (7), which is also correct.

3. However, let's check whether the transformation was applied correctly based on the provided steps and the overall pattern:
   - According to the overall pattern, the starting index of the object should be increased by 3 if it's less than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 16. In this case, the starting index is 8, so no change should occur during the transformation since neither condition is met.

Upon analyzing the provided transformation rules and evaluating the test output, we can conclude that the test output was **not** transformed correctly according to the provided transformation patterns and steps. Specifically, there were no changes made to the starting index despite none of the conditions being met. Thus, I recommend a score of `0` for this test output.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

In this problem, we notice that only one object changes color given the conditions mentioned above. We can create an overall pattern by incorporating those rules and describing actions step-by-step as specified in the `overall_pattern`.

  }
}
```

In summary, contiguous objects with color 1 and size greater than 1 will be recolored to 4, except when their size equals 1.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.

- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.

output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 2}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 2}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: an object's color changes from 1 to 4 under these conditions: its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1.
overall pattern: for each object, check whether the above conditions are met; if so, change its color to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged.



transformation steps: [{'step': 'For each object in the input, check if its color is 1.'}, {'step': 'For each object with color 1, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1.'}, {'step': 'If all the above conditions are met, change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged.'}]

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when their start_index is smaller than 8, is odd, and they have a positive size.
overall pattern: For each object, if the start_index is smaller than 8, is odd, and it has a positive size, then change its color to 4. Otherwise, leave the object unchanged.

 Based on the given input, here is the description of the objects in the input:
There are five objects in total. The first object has a color value of 1, starts at index 1, ends at index 2, and has a size of 2. The second object has a color value of 1, starts at index 4, ends at index 8, and has a size of 5. The third object has a color value of 1, starts at index 11, ends at index 12, and has a size of 2. The fourth object has a color value of 1, starts at index 14, ends at index 15, and has a size of 2. The fifth object has a color value of 1, starts at index 18, ends at index 18, and has a size of 1.

Based on the provided transformation pattern and steps, the transformed objects will look like this in the test output:
Object_1: {'color': 4,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2,'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1,'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8,'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 12,'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 1,'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 15,'size': 2}, Object_5: {'color': 1,'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18,'size': 1}. This is because the first object has a start_index less than 8 (which is 1), the index is odd, and the size is greater than 0. Therefore, according to the provided rule, its color changes to 4. However, none of the other objects meet these conditions; therefore, their colors remain the same (which is 1).

Here is the information about the test output:
'input\_description': regarding the test input, there are five objects in total. The first object has a color value of 1, starts at index 1, ends at index 2, and has a size of 2. The second object has a color value of 1, starts at index 4, ends at index 8, and has a size of 5. The third object has a color value of 1, starts at index 11, ends at index 12, and has a size of 2. The fourth object has a color value of 1, starts at index 14, ends at index 15, and has a size of 2. The fifth object has a color value of 1, starts at index 18, ends at index 18, and has a size of 1.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 20], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 2}
output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 2}

output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 4}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 7}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 2}

output: Dimension: [1, 20], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: an object's color changes from 1 to 4 under these conditions: its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1.
overall pattern: for each object, check whether the above conditions are met; if so, change its color to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged.


transformation steps: [{'step': 'For each object in the input, check if its color is 1.'}, {'step': 'For each object with color 1, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1.'}, {'step': 'If all the above conditions are met, change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged.'}]


Test case:

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here is the transformation for the test case:

```json
{
  "input_description": "The input contains five objects. Object_1 has a size of 2, starts at index 1, and has a color of 1. Object_2 has a size of 5, starts at index 4, and has a color of 1. Object_3 has a size of 2, starts at index 11, and has a color of 1. Object_4 has a size of 2, starts at index 14, and has a color of 1. Object_5 has a size of 1, starts at index 18, and has a color of 1.",
  "transformation": "For each object, check if its color is 1. If it is, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1. If all the conditions are met, change the color of the object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged.",
  "output": {
    "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 20],
    "transformed_objects": [
      {"color": 4, "start_index": 1, "end_index": 2, "size": 2},
      {"color": 1, "start_index": 4, "end_index": 8, "size": 5},
      {"color": 1, "start_index": 11, "end_index": 12, "size": 2},
      {"color": 4, "start_index": 14, "end_index": 15, "size": 2},
      {"color": 1, "start_index": 18, "end_index": 18, "size": 1}
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that Object\_2 does not meet the conditions for changing its color since its size is less than or equal to 1 even though its position falls within the specified range. Similarly, Object\_5 also does not meet the conditions for changing its color since its position is outside the specified range.
------
 Based on the given information, here is the transformation for the test case:

```json
{
  "input_description": "The input contains five objects. Object_1 has a color of 1, a size of 2, and its start and end indices are 1 and 2 respectively. Object_2 has a color of 1, a size of 5, and its start and end indices are 4 and 8 respectively. Object_3 has a color of 1, a size of 2, and its start and end indices are 11 and 12 respectively. Object_4 has a color of 1, a size of 2, and its start and end indices are 14 and 15 respectively. Object_5 has a color of 1 and its size, start index, and end index are 1, 18, and 18 respectively.",
  "transformation": "For each object in the input, check if its color is 1. If it is, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1. If all the conditions are met, change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged. Therefore, Object_1 will remain unchanged, Object_2 will change its color to 4, Object_3 will remain unchanged, Object_4 will remain unchanged, and Object_5 will be removed since it doesn't meet the condition of having a size greater than 1.",
  "output": {
    "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 20],
    "transformed_objects": "[{\"color\": 1, \"start_index\": 1, \"end_index\": 2, \"size\": 2}, {\"color\": 4, \"start_index\": 4, \"end_index\": 8, \"size\": 5}, {\"color\": 1, \"start_index\": 11, \"end_index\": 12, \"size\": 2}, {\"color\": 1, \"start_index\": 14, \"end_index\": 15, \"size\": 2}]"
  }
}
```
------
 Based on the input description, there are five objects in the input sequence:

* Object 1 has a color of 1, starts at index 1 and ends at index 2 (size: 2)
* Object 2 has a color of 1, starts at index 4 and ends at index 8 (size: 5)
* Object 3 has a color of 1, starts at index 11 and ends at index 12 (size: 2)
* Object 4 has a color of 1, starts at index 14 and ends at index 15 (size: 2)
* Object 5 has a color of 1, starts at index 18 and ends at index 18 (size: 1)

According to the transformation steps provided, we need to apply the following transformation to the input:

1. Check if the color of each object is 1. All objects in this test case meet this condition.
2. Check if the position of each object is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1. Only Object 2 meets these conditions (since it starts at index 4 and has size 5).
3. Change the color of Object 2 from 1 to 4, but keep its position and size unchanged.

Thus, the output should look like:

{
  "input\_description": "There are five consecutive groups of adjacent pixels in the input sequence. One group consists of two pixels with color 1 starting at index 1, another group contains five pixels with color 1 starting at index 4, one group includes two pixels with color 1 starting at index 11, one group contains two pixels with color 1 starting at index 14, and the last group has one pixel with color 1 starting at index 18.",
  "transformation": "Change the color of the second object to 4, leaving its position and size unchanged. This results in the second object having a color of 4 instead of 1.",
  "output": {
    "test\_case\_output\_dimension": [1, 20],
    "transformed\_objects": [
      {"color": 1, "start\_index": 1, "end\_index": 2, "size": 2},
      {"color": 4, "start\_index": 4, "end\_index": 8, "size": 5},
      {"color": 1, "start\_index": 11, "end\_index": 12, "size": 2},
      {"color": 1, "start\_index": 14, "end\_index": 15, "size": 2},
      {"color": 1, "start\_index": 18, "end\_index": 18, "size": 1}
    ]
  }
}
------
 Based on the input description, the input contains:
- Object_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 2,'size': 2}
- Object_2: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 4, 'end\_index': 8,'size': 5}
- Object_3: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 12,'size': 2}
- Object_4: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 14, 'end\_index': 15,'size': 2}
- Object_5: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 18, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 1}

According to the transformation steps provided, we will apply the following steps:

Step 1: Check if each object has a color of 1. In this case, all objects (Object\_1 through Object\_5) meet this condition.

Step 2: Check if the position of each object is at least 1 and at most 16, and if its size is greater than 1. Only Object\_2 meets these conditions.

Step 3: Change the color of any object that meets all the above conditions from 1 to 4. Thus, only Object\_2 should be changed to have a color of 4.

Based on the applied transformation, here is the expected output:

{'input\_description': 'The input consists of five objects with sizes ranging from 1 to 5. Object\_1 starts at position 1, followed by Object\_2 spanning across positions 4 to 8, Object\_3 starting at position 11, Object\_4 starting at position 14, and Object\_5 consisting of a single pixel at position 18.',

'transformation': 'After applying the transformation steps, Object\_2 is now colored 4 since it meets the requirements of having a position between 1 and 16 and a size larger than 1. All other objects retain their original properties.',

'output': {'test\_case\_output\_dimension': '[1, 20]',
'transformed\_objects': 'Object\_1: {"color": 1, "start\_index": 1, "end\_index": 2, "size": 2}, Object\_2: {"color": 4, "start\_index": 4, "end\_index": 8, "size": 5}, Object\_3: {"color": 1, "start\_index": 11, "end\_index": 12, "size": 2}, Object\_4: {"color": 1, "start\_index": 14, "end\_index": 15, "size": 2}, Object\_5: {"color": 1, "start\_index": 18, "end\_index": 18, "size": 1}'}}

 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we note that the input and output dimensions match (both are of length 20). Next, let's examine each object in the output and compare it to the expected result based on the input and transformation rules.

1. Color 4 at indices 1-2: This matches the first object in the input since its start\_index is 1 (odd), has a positive size, and its color changes due to the conditions being met.
2. Color 1 at indices 4-8: This remains unchanged, as the second object does not meet any of the conditions mentioned in the pattern.
3. Color 1 at indices 11-12: This remains unchanged, as the third object meets none of the conditions required for changing its color.
4. Color 1 at indices 14-15: This remains unchanged, as the fourth object meets none of the conditions required for changing its color.
5. Color 1 at index 18: This also remains unchanged since this single-pixel object doesn't fulfill the condition about having a start\_index < 8.

Since no discrepancies were found compared to the expected transformation results, we can conclude that the test output was generated using the correct transformation process.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output:

First, let's go through each step of the transformation instructions:

1. For each object in the input, check if its color is 1. This condition is met for Objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
   
2. For each object with color 1, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1. This condition is met for Objects 1 and 4. It is not met for Objects 2, 3, and 5 because their positions are either less than 1 (Object 2) or greater than 16 (Objects 3 and 5), or their sizes are not greater than 1 (Object 2).
    
3. If all the above conditions are met, change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged. This step is executed for Objects 1 and 4, changing their colors to 4.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the correct transformation of the test input results in the following output:

test case output dimension: [1, 20]
transformed objects: [{'color': 4,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2,'size': 2}, {'color': 1,'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8,'size': 5}, {'color': 1,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 12,'size': 2}, {'color': 4,'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 15,'size': 2}, {'color': 1,'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18,'size': 1}]

Comparison with the given test output shows that it matches our expected output. Thus, we can conclude that the transformation was applied correctly to the test input.

Based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10.
------
 Based on the provided information, here is the evaluation of the given test output:

1. The first object in the test output has a color of 4, which indicates that the transformation was applied correctly since it meets the conditions outlined in the overall pattern (position 1 and size 2).
2. The second object retains its original color of 1, indicating that the conditions were not met (position 4 and size 5), which is correct based on the overall pattern.
3. The third object retains its original color of 1, indicating that the conditions were not met (position 11 and size 2), which is correct based on the overall pattern.
4. The fourth object in the test output has a color of 4, which indicates that the transformation was applied correctly since it meets the conditions outlined in the overall pattern (position 14 and size 2).
5. The fifth object retains its original color of 1, indicating that the conditions were not met (position 18 and size 1), which is correct based on the overall pattern.

Overall, based on the analysis of the given transformation instructions and the provided test input and test output, the test output appears to be correct. Therefore, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output by analyzing each transformation step.

Step 1: For each object in the input, check if its color is 1.
- In the test input, we have 5 objects, and their colors are [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. This step is satisfied.

Step 2: For each object with color 1, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1.
- Object_1 has a position range of [1, 2] and size 2, satisfying this condition.
- Object_2 has a position range of [4, 8] and size 5, also satisfying this condition.
- Object_3, Object_4, and Object_5 do not satisfy this condition (position out of range or size equal to 1).

Step 3: If all the above conditions are met, change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged.
- Only Object_1 and Object_2 meet all the conditions. However, based on the test output, only Object_2 has been changed from 1 to 4, while Object_1 remains unchanged. This is incorrect according to the given rules and patterns.

Given the discrepancy found during our evaluation, it appears that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input. I would rate the test output a 3 out of 10 due to inconsistencies in applying the specified transformation rules.
------
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, we can evaluate the test output as follows:

First, let's consider each step of the transformation instructions:

* Step 1: For each object in the input, check if its color is 1. This condition is satisfied for objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the test input.
* Step 2: For each object with color 1, check if its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1. This condition is satisfied for object 2 (position 4, size 5) and object 4 (position 14, size 2).
* Step 3: If all the above conditions are met, change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 while keeping the position and size unchanged. This step is correctly applied to objects 2 and 4 in the test input, changing their colors to 4 in the test output.

However, there are some discrepancies in the test output compared to the expected output:

* Object 1 is not changed in the test output, but it should remain unchanged since its position (1) is outside the range (1, 16).
* Objects 3 and 5 do not meet any of the conditions specified in the pattern, yet they are missing from the test output. They should both remain unchanged in the output.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the test output does not fully comply with the expected output and the given transformation pattern.

Value: 5/10. Although the transformation is partially correct, the missing objects in the test output negatively impact the accuracy of the result.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given input-output pairs and the described transformation pattern, it can be observed that for an object to change its color from 1 to 4, two conditions must be satisfied:

1. Its position must be in the range of 1 to 16 (inclusive).
2. Its size must be greater than 1.

Given the test case, we can evaluate its output based on the provided rules:

Input:
Dimension: [1, 20]
Objects:
- Object_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 2,'size': 2}
- Object_2: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 4, 'end\_index': 8,'size': 5}
- Object_3: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 12,'size': 2}
- Object_4: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 14, 'end\_index': 15,'size': 2}
- Object_5: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 18, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 1}

Output:
Dimensions: [1, 20]
Transformed Objects:
- Object_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 2,'size': 2}
- Object_2: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 4, 'end\_index': 8,'size': 5}
- Object_3: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 12,'size': 2}
- Object_4: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 14, 'end\_index': 15,'size': 2}
- Object_5: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 18, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 1}

Analyzing the test output according to the transformation instructions:

- Object_1 has not been changed since its size does not meet the condition of being greater than 1. This is correct according to the rules.
- Object_2 meets both conditions, i.e., its position (4) is less than or equal to 16 and its size (5) is greater than 1; thus, the color must be updated to 4. However, this did not happen in the test output. It appears incorrect based on the given rules.
- Object_3 remains unchanged because its size (2) doesn't meet the requirement of being greater than 1. This is consistent with the rules.
- Object_4 also stays the same due to the fact that its starting index (14) falls outside the required range. This matches the defined rules.
- Object_5 is left untouched, as expected due to its small size (1), which doesn't satisfy the criteria.

Value: 2 - Only one out of five objects were modified according to the rules. Although some aspects of the test output appear to follow the instructions, it fails in a significant number of cases.
------
 Based on the given input and output for the test case, we can evaluate the correctness of the transformation by analyzing each step outlined in the transformation steps provided. Here's how it goes:

1. Check if each object has color 1:
   - Object_1: Color = 1
   - Object_2: Color = 1
   - Object_3: Color = 1
   - Object_4: Color = 1
   - Object_5: Color = 1

2. Check if for each object with color 1, its position is at least 1 and at most 16, and its size is greater than 1:
   - Object_1: Position (1) meets the condition, Size (2) does not meet the condition, thus no color change required.
   - Object_2: Position (4) meets the condition, Size (5) meets the condition, thus color needs to be changed to 4.
   - Object_3: Position (11) meets the condition, Size (2) does not meet the condition, thus no color change required.
   - Object_4: Position (14) meets the condition, Size (2) does not meet the condition, thus no color change required.
   - Object_5: Position (18) does not meet the condition, thus no color change required.

3. Change the color of the current object from 1 to 4 where applicable:
   - Object_1 remains Color = 1
   - Object_2 becomes Color = 4
   - Object_3 remains Color = 1
   - Object_4 remains Color = 1
   - Object_5 remains Color = 1

From this evaluation, we observe that the transformation has been applied according to the specified rules for the first, second, third, and fifth objects. However, the fourth object did not receive a color change despite meeting the positional requirement because its size was less than 2. Given the stated conditions, the transformation appears to be incorrectly implemented as the color should indeed be changed when the other criteria are met even if the size constraint is not satisfied.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would rate the test output as follows:

{
"test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
"value": 6
}

A score of 6 reflects the fact that the transformation function produces expected results for some cases but erroneously fails to apply the transformation to one of the eligible objects due to an oversight in implementation.

Since there is no test output to evaluate against, it is impossible to determine if the transformation was applied correctly. Therefore, I am providing a value of `0` in the JSON response, indicating that it cannot be determined if the transformation was performed accurately based on the given information.
------
 Based on the problem statement, here is the evaluation of the given test output and analysis of whether the transformation was correctly applied to the test input:

First, let's define the expected output based on the given overall pattern and transformation steps.

Expected Output:
Dimension: [1, 20], Object\_1: {\'color\': 4, \'start\_index\': 1, \'end\_index\': 2, \'size\': 2}, Object\_2: {\'color\': 4, \'start\_index\': 4, \'end\_index\': 8, \'size\': 5}, Object\_3: {\'color\': 1, \'start\_index\': 11, \'end\_index\': 12, \'size\': 2}, Object\_4: {\'color\': 4, \'start\_index\': 14, \'end\_index\': 15, \'size\': 2}, Object\_5: {\'color\': 1, \'start\_index\': 18, \'end\_index\': 18, \'size\': 1}

Since no output was provided for the test case, we will assume that it is identical to the given input. Comparing this assumed output to the expected output, we find that:

* Object\_1 has a correct color (4) but incorrect position (should be at least 1 and at most 16).
* Object\_2 has the correct color (4), position (4), and size (5).
* Object\_3 has the correct color (1), position (11), and size (2).
* Object\_4 has the correct color (4) but incorrect position (should be at least 1 and at most 16).
* Object\_5 has the correct color (1) but incorrect position (should be at least 1 and at most 16).

Therefore, the transformation seems to have been partially applied to some of the objects, but not entirely correctly due to the incorrect positions of Object\_1, Object\_4, and Object\_5.

Based on this analysis, I would rate the accuracy of the test output as 3 out of 10, since only one object (Object\_2) has the correct position, color, and size according to the given overall pattern and transformation steps.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 22], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 22], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

The overall pattern appears to accurately describe the transformation in each example. However, one potential issue is that it assumes there are no other objects with color 5 present in the input. If other objects with color 5 were present further to the right, they would also be changed to color 9 based on the current formulation of the pattern. This may or may not be desirable depending on the specific application.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}.

    }
}
```
------
 Based on the input description, there are four objects in the input sequence. The first object has a color of 5, starts at index 3, ends at index 6 (inclusive), and has a size of 4. The second object also has a color of 5, starts at index 8, ends at index 9 (inclusive), and has a size of 2. The third object has a color of 5, starts at index 11, ends at index 14 (inclusive), and has a size of 4. Finally, the fourth object has a color of 5, starts at index 17, ends at index 18 (inclusive), and has a size of 2.

According to the overall pattern and transformation steps provided, we need to traverse through the objects from left to right while keeping track of our current position. When we encounter a group of objects with color 5, we replace the color of each subsequent object with color 5 (excluding the very first one) to color 9. In this case, we will replace the color of the second, third, and fourth objects since they all have a color of 5.

Therefore, the transformation would result in the following:

Output:
Dimension: [1, 22]
Transformed Objects: Object_1: {color: 5, start\_index: 3, end\_index: 6, size: 4}, Object_2: {color: 9, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 9, size: 2}, Object_3: {color: 9, start\_index: 11, end\_index: 14, size: 4}, Object_4: {color: 9, start\_index: 17, end\_index: 18, size: 2}

So, the output for the test case is:

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the analysis of the given transformation instructions and the test input and output, here's the evaluation:

* The transformation starts by traversing through the objects from left to right. In the test case, we can see that the objects with color 5 are processed in order.
* When the transformation encounters a group of objects with color 5, it replaces the color of each subsequent object with color 5 (excluding the very first one) to color 9. This is demonstrated in the test case where the second, third, and fourth object's color change from 5 to 9.
* However, upon closer inspection, the second object in the test output still has a color of 5 instead of the expected 9. This discrepancy indicates that the transformation was not correctly applied to this specific object.
* Additionally, since the second object was not transformed properly, it also affects the correctness of other objects downstream, making the whole transformation inconsistent with the provided instructions.

Based on the above observations, the test output does not accurately reflect the application of the given transformation rules due to the incorrect handling of some objects' colors during the process. A more accurate implementation would result in the color of the second object being changed to 9 instead of retaining its original value of 5.

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'In the test output, adjacent pixels with the same color were detected, but their treatment did not adhere strictly to the instructions. Specifically, when traversing through the objects from left to right, the replacement of certain objects with color 5 to color 9 was missed, leading to inconsistencies in the final output. The transformation requires reevaluation to ensure proper application of the rules.', 'value': '4'}
------
 Based on the given overall pattern and transformation steps, we can evaluate the test output as follows:

First, let's identify the groups of objects with color 5:

* Group 1: Object_1 with color 5, starts at index 3, ends at index 6
* Group 2: Object_3 with color 5, starts at index 11, ends at index 14

Now, let's check if the transformation has been applied correctly according to the rules provided:

1. Replace the color of each subsequent object with color 5 (excluding the very first one) to color 9.

Group 1:

* First object is not changed since it should not be considered (first object with color 5).
* Second object (index 5) is replaced with color 9.

Group 2:

* First object is not changed since it should not be considered (first object with color 5).
* Second object (index 12) is replaced with color 9.
* Third object (index 13) is replaced with color 9.

From this evaluation, the given test output matches the expected outcome based on the transformation rules provided.

Therefore,

 {'test\_output\_analysis': 'For the given test input, we would expect the transformation to change the color of certain groups of consecutive objects with color 5 to color 9. However, since no output is provided for the test case, it cannot be evaluated directly. Therefore, this analysis will assume a hypothetical output based on the described transformation pattern and evaluate it against the test input.

Hypothetical output: Dimension: [1, 22], Object\_1: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4}, Object\_2: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}, Object\_3: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4}, Object\_4: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}

Applying the transformation steps to the hypothetical output:

* Traverse through the objects from left to right, keeping track of your current position along the way.
	+ At index 3, the first object with color 5 starts at this index, so keep tracking.
	+ Reach the last object with color 5 at index 6; now check the next object.
	+ Index 7 has no associated object; continue checking until reaching the next object with color 5.
	+ Another object with color 5 begins at index 11; repeat the process.
	+ Last object with color 5 ends at index 14.
	+ No further objects remain after processing the fourth object.

Given the above analysis, the test input seems to follow the correct transformation procedure as no issues were found during evaluation against the hypothetical output. However, without an actual output, a definitive rating cannot be assigned.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the given transformation pattern and steps. We need to check whether the traversal through the objects from left to right has been performed correctly and if the replacement of the color of each subsequent object with color 5 (excluding the very first one) to color 9 has taken place accordingly.

Here is the original test input:

Objects = [
Object\_1: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4},
Object\_2: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2},
Object\_3: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4},
Object\_4: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}
]

And here is the test output:

Transformed objects = [
{'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4},
{'color': 5,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2},
{'color': 9,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4},
{'color': 9,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}
]

By observing the test output, it seems like the transformation step was followed for all objects with color 5 except for the very first one. However, this contradicts the requirement mentioned in the problem statement: "If there are no more objects with color 5, nothing happens." In this particular test output, the fact that no more objects appear after 'Object\_4', we would expect the transformation step to be skipped entirely since there are no further objects with color 5 to modify.

Given these findings, I suggest giving a value near 0 to reflect incorrect implementation based on the given requirements. Though the algorithm was able to apply the rule correctly, it failed to consider that the last item did not require transformation as per the instruction, so:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
"value": 1
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output:

1. Traverse through the objects from left to right, keeping track of the current position along the way.
	* In the test input, we have four objects with color 5 located at indices 3-6, 8-9, 11-14, and 17-18.
2. Replace the color of each subsequent object with color 5 (excluding the very first one) to color 9 when encountering a group of objects with color 5.
	* Starting from the second object (with color 5), at indices 8-9, the color is changed to 9. This is correct based on the given conditions.
	* Continuing with the third object (with color 5), at indices 11-14, the color is changed to 9. Again, this matches the expected outcome.
	* Finally, there is only one remaining object with color 5, so no further changes occur according to condition 1.

Based on the analysis above, it appears that the test output has been generated using the described transformation steps appropriately. Therefore, I would rate the test output as:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input has been correctly transformed into its test output.",
"value": 10

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, we can evaluate the test output as follows:

1. Traverse through the objects from left to right, keeping track of the current position.
2. Check each object to see if it has color 5 and replace the color of each subsequent object with color 5 (excluding the very first one) to color 9.

For the test case:

Input: Dimension: [1, 22], Object\_1: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4}, Object\_2: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}, Object\_3: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4}, Object\_4: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}

Output: Transformed objects: [{'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4}, {'color': 9,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}, {'color': 9,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4}, {'color': 9,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}]

From the given information, it appears that the test output was generated according to the specified rules. We can confirm this by manually checking each object:

* Object\_1 starts at index 3 and ends at index 6, so it is correct.
* Object\_2 starts at index 8 and ends at index 9, and its color has been changed to 9, so it is correct.
* Object\_3 starts at index 11 and ends at index 14, and its color has been changed to 9, so it is correct.
* Object\_4 starts at index 17 and ends at index 18, and its color has been changed to 9, so it is correct.

Therefore, based on the provided information and manual verification, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10.
------
 Based on the given overall pattern and transformation steps, we can evaluate the correctness of the test output as follows:

1. Traverse through the objects from left to right, keeping track of the current position.
2. In this test case, there are four groups of objects with color 5:
* Group 1: `{'color': 5,'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6,'size': 4}`
* Group 2: `{'color': 5,'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 9,'size': 2}`
* Group 3: `{'color': 5,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 14,'size': 4}`
* Group 4: `{'color': 5,'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 18,'size': 2}`

3. According to the pattern, from the second group onwards, we need to replace the color of each object with color 5 to color 9 while excluding the very first one in each group. Let's check each group:
* Group 1 is excluded because it is the first group.
* For Group 2, we need to keep the first object (with `start_index` 8) unchanged and change the next occurrence (if exists). Since it has no further occurrences, nothing needs to be changed. Therefore, `{'color': 5,'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 9,'size': 2}` remains.
* For Group 3, the first object (with `start_index` 11) should remain unchanged, so we need to change the last three indices:
```json
[
  {"color": 9, "start_index": 11, "end_index": 11, "size": 1},
  {"color": 9, "start_index": 12, "end_index": 13, "size": 2},
  {"color": 9, "start_index": 14, "end_index": 14, "size": 1}
]
```
* For Group 4, we don't need to do anything since it does not meet the condition of having at least two color-5 objects in the group. So, `{'color': 5,'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 18,'size': 2}` remains.

4. Combining the results, our final transformed objects should look like this:
```json
[
  {"color": 5, "start_index": 3, "end_index": 6, "size": 4},
  {"color": 5, "start_index": 8, "end_index": 9, "size": 2},
  {"color": 9, "start_index": 11, "end_index": 11, "size": 1},
  {"color": 9, "start_index": 12, "end_index": 13, "size": 2},
  {"color": 9, "start_index": 14, "end_index": 14, "size": 1},
  {"color": 5, "start_index": 17, "end_index": 18, "size": 2}
]
```

Given the expected result above and the test output provided, some discrepancies were found in the test output, especially concerning Group 3. Hereby I provide my evaluation:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output according to the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify the objects in the input:

* Object_1: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4}
* Object_2: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}

* Object_4: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}

Next, we check if there is more than one object, and indeed, there are four objects. Therefore, starting from the second object (Object\_2), we need to change the color of each consecutive object to 9. In the test output, this condition holds true:

* Object\_2: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}
* Object\_3: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4}
* Object\_4: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}

Given the evaluation above, it appears that the given test output has been generated based on the correct application of the transformation pattern and steps. However, it is important to note that this conclusion assumes accurate implementation of the described steps since they weren't explicitly shown here. A minor discrepancy could exist due to formatting differences in presenting the object data (commas vs. semicolons). Nevertheless, based on the available information, I can provide the following response:

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering the provided transformation pattern and steps, the test input seems to have been transformed accurately into the test output.', 'value': '10'}
------
 Based on the given examples and the described transformation pattern, it can be observed that when there is more than one object in the input, starting from the second object, each consecutive object's color changes to 9 in the output. In this test case, there are indeed four objects in the input. Now let's evaluate the given test output based on the provided transformation steps.

Transformation Step 1: Identify the objects in the input
In the test case, the identified objects in the input are:
- Object_1: {'color': 5,'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6,'size': 4}
- Object_2: {'color': 5,'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 9,'size': 2}
- Object_3: {'color': 5,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 14,'size': 4}
- Object_4: {'color': 5,'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 18,'size': 2}

This matches the actual objects in the test input. So far so good.

Transformation Step 2: Check if there is more than one object
There are indeed four objects in the test input. That condition has been met.

Transformation Step 3: Starting from the second object, change the color of each consecutive object to 9
Let's look at the changed colors in the test case output:
- Object_1: {'color': 5,'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6,'size': 4} (no change)
- Object_2: {'color': 9,'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 9,'size': 2} (changed to 9)
- Object_3: {'color': 9,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 14,'size': 4} (changed to 9)
- Object_4: {'color': 9,'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 18,'size': 2} (changed to 9)

All the colors were updated correctly according to the given instruction, starting from the second object.

Considering the complete set of instructions and analyzing how they were applied in the test case, we can see everything was done accordingly. Therefore, I would rate the test output as 10 out of 10 since no discrepancies were found.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given information, let's evaluate the provided test output against the input using the provided transformation pattern and steps.

First, we identify the objects in the input:
Input Object_1: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4}
Input Object\_2: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}
Input Object\_3: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4}
Input Object\_4: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}

Next, check if there is more than one object (there are 4 objects).

Following the transformation steps, starting from the second object, change the color of each consecutive object to 9:
Output Object\_1: {'color': 5,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 4}
Output Object\_2: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 2}
Output Object\_3: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 4}
Output Object\_4: {'color': 9,'start\_index': 17, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 2}

Comparing our results with the given test output, they match. Therefore, based on our analysis, the test output seems to be correct according to the given transformation pattern and steps. Thus, I would rate the test output as a 10 out of 10.

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering the given transformation pattern and steps, the test input appears to be correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 10}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output by analyzing each step of the transformation instructions.

1. **Identify the objects in the input:** In the test input, we can see that the objects have been accurately identified with their respective colors, start and end indices, and sizes.
   
2. **Check if there is more than one object:** Yes, there are four objects in the test input, satisfying this condition.

3. **Starting from the second object, change the color of each consecutive object to 9:** This step has been partially implemented correctly, but there seems to be an issue in identifying the correct index where the change should take place. Specifically, the `end_index` of the previous object should be used instead of the `start_index`. Therefore, the second object (with original color 5) should have had its `end_index` changed to 9 instead of the `start_index` being changed.
	
Due to this discrepancy, the third and fourth objects still retain their original color (5) instead of having it updated to 9. As a result, although most of the transformation was performed correctly, this error causes some inconsistencies.

Therefore, I would rate the test output as follows:
```json
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
  "value": 7
}
```
This rating accounts for the fact that three out of four consecutive objects were transformed correctly while disregarding the last object. However, since there is a systematic issue affecting the consistency of the results, this lower rating is justified.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output by analyzing each step of the transformation instructions.

Step 1: Identify the objects in the input
For this test case, we have four objects:
- Object_1: color=5, start\_index=3, end\_index=6, size=4
- Object_2: color=5, start\_index=8, end\_index=9, size=2
- Object_3: color=5, start\_index=11, end\_index=14, size=4
- Object_4: color=5, start\_index=17, end\_index=18, size=2

Step 2: Check if there is more than one object
In this test case, yes, there are more than one object (there are four).

Step 3: Starting from the second object, change the color of each consecutive object to 9
Let's apply this step:
- Object_1: color=5, start\_index=3, end\_index=6, size=4 -> unchanged since it's the first object
- Object_2: color=5, start\_index=8, end\_index=9, size=2 -> changed color to 9
- Object_3: color=5, start\_index=11, end\_index=14, size=4 -> changed color to 9
- Object_4: color=5, start\_index=17, end\_index=18, size=2 -> changed color to 9

Transformed objects according to Step 3:
- Transformed Object_1: color=5, start\_index=3, end\_index=6, size=4
- Transformed Object_2: color=9, start\_index=8, end\_index=9, size=2
- Transformed Object_3: color=9, start\_index=11, end\_index=14, size=4
- Transformed Object_4: color=9, start\_index=17, end\_index=18, size=2

It appears that the transformation process has been followed correctly. However, let's notice that the test output provides information about the dimensions of the array. Since this is a 1D array, no further checks regarding image resizing, padding, etc., are required. But just based on the provided information, let us consider the correctness of the reported output dimension.

Dimensions: [1, 22] -> This specifies a single row matrix (dim = 1) and 22 columns vector (len = 22). Considering the specified positions of the pixels before changing their color, they actually fit inside such a predefined structure, taking up 22 spots including background zeros (if any).

We can now rate the quality of the result based on our observations and analysis. We do not encounter any issues after careful examination, so we shall provide a good rating. However, please note that providing a perfect score may reflect better upon the reviewer's confidence in the result rather than its absolute accuracy; thus, I recommend giving a slightly lower rating than a perfect score due to the inherent uncertainty involved in manual evaluations.

Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as an integer:

{
"test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze whether the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
"value": 9
}
------
 Based on the input and output provided for the test case, it appears that the transformation has been applied correctly according to the given instructions. Here's how we can verify this:

* First, we identify the objects in the input, which are provided explicitly in this case. There are four objects with colors ranging from 5 to 9.
* Next, we check if there is more than one object. In this case, there are indeed four objects.
* Starting from the second object (index 1), we change the color of each consecutive object to 9. We see that in the output, Object\_2, Object\_3, and Object\_4 have their colors changed to 9, while Object\_1 remains unchanged.

Therefore, based on the given instructions, the test output appears to be correct. However, it is worth noting that there seems to be a discrepancy in the formatting of the output. Specifically, the output includes both the original dimensions and the transformed objects, whereas previous examples included only the transformed objects. Nonetheless, since the transformed objects match what would be expected based on the instructions, I will assume that this minor inconsistency does not affect the validity of the output.

Overall, I would rate the test output as a 10 out of 10.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the given information, here's the analysis of the test output:

1. The dimensions of both the input and output are the same, which is [1, 22]. This satisfies the first condition of the overall pattern.

2. The input contains four objects, and the output shows that the color of the second, third, and fourth objects have been changed to 9. This matches the second and third steps of the overall pattern.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems that the second object in the output is not transformed correctly. According to the overall pattern, starting from the second object, each consecutive object should change color to 9. But in this case, only the color of the third and fourth objects are changed to 9, while the second object remains unchanged (it should have been changed to 9).

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would rate the test output as 7 out of 10. One point is deducted because the second object was not transformed correctly as per the given pattern.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the input and the transformation pattern. We will go through each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.

1. **Identify the objects in the input:**
   Test Input Objects:
   [
     {"color": 5, "start\_index": 3, "end\_index": 6, "size": 4},
     {"color": 5, "start\_index": 8, "end\_index": 9, "size": 2},
     {"color": 5, "start\_index": 11, "end\_index": 14, "size": 4},
     {"color": 5, "start\_index": 17, "end\_index": 18, "size": 2}
   ]

   Test Output Transformed Objects:
   [
     {"color": 5, "start\_index": 3, "end\_index": 6, "size": 4},
     {"color": 9, "start\_index": 8, "end\_index": 9, "size": 2},
     {"color": 9, "start\_index": 11, "end\_index": 14, "size": 4},
     {"color": 5, "start\_index": 17, "end\_index": 18, "size": 2}
   ]

2. **Check if there is more than one object:**
   Yes, there are four objects in this specific test case.

3. **Starting from the second object, change the color of each consecutive object to 9:**
   In this test case, we see that after processing the first object (which remains unchanged), the next three objects have been updated correctly according to the rule described above. Their original `color` value of 5 has changed to 9 as expected.

As all the transformation rules were followed accurately for all identified objects in the test input, it appears that the transformation was indeed applied correctly to the test input. Therefore, based on your analysis, I would rate the test output as a 10 out of 10.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}

conditions: Objects change based on their color, position, and size. If an object is at a specific position, its size may increase, and it may move according to a particular rule.

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, it can be observed that the objects maintain their original color and size, but their positions undergo systematic changes. Specifically, the starting index of every object increases consistently from its initial value. This implies that some function f(color, start_index, size) possibly determines the final destination of each object. However, currently available data does not provide sufficient information to accurately define this function.
overall pattern: Given an input sequence containing multiple objects of identical color but varying positions, apply a transformation rule whereby the starting index of each object i is incremented by a quantity di, determined by factors like the objects color, current position, and size. As a result, produce an output sequence where each object remains unaltered in terms of color and size, but shifted to a new position according to the calculated offset.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.

This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_3:

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, when an object has a size of 1 or 3, its end_index value shifts based on predictable conditions determined by its size. Single-pixel objects may either retain their initial end_index value or double it, depending on the specific input.
overall pattern: To transform any input, iterate through the objects. If the object has a size of 1, leave its end_index value unchanged. Otherwise, apply a repeating pattern of incrementing the end_index value by 2, followed by two separate increments of 3 and 2 respectively. Keep track of the largest applied offset during this process and ensure all single-pixel objects receive an end_index value equal to their starting index plus this maximum offset value.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 9, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, when an object has a size of 1 or 3, its end_index value shifts based on predictable conditions determined by its size. Single-pixel objects may either retain their initial end_index value or double it, depending on the specific input.
overall pattern: To transform any input, iterate through the objects. If the object has a size of 1, leave its end_index value unchanged. Otherwise, apply a repeating pattern of incrementing the end_index value by 2, followed by two separate increments of 3 and 2 respectively. Keep track of the largest applied offset during this process and ensure all single-pixel objects receive an end_index value equal to their starting index plus this maximum offset value.


transformation steps: [ 'Iterate through each object in the input sequence.', 'If the object size is 1:', '* Leave the end_index of the object unchanged if the next object (if exists) also has a size of 1; otherwise, set the end_index to start_index + max_offset (see step 5).', 'If the object size is 3:', '* Set the end_index to start_index + 2.', '* Increment the end_index by 3.', '* Increment the end_index by 2.', '* Keep track of the largest end_index offset (max_offset).', '* After processing all objects, adjust the end_index of single-pixel objects (size 1) by setting them to start_index + max_offset.' ] 


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}

"value": 7
}

Explanation:

1. Iterate through each object in the input sequence:
   - Input: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 3,'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 6, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 1}, Object\_3: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 10, 'end\_index': 10,'size': 1}
   - Output: [1, 32], Object\_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 9,'size': 3}, Object\_2: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 3,'size': 1}, Object\_3: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 10, 'end\_index': 14,'size': 1}

2. If the object size is 1:
   - Consider Object\_2, since it's the first object with a size of 1. We don't know the `max_offset` yet, so we cannot determine whether the end\_index should be adjusted according to step 2b.

3. If the object size is 3:
   - Consider Object\_1 with a size of 3. End\_index starts at 3, then gets incremented twice by 2 and once by 3, resulting in 9, which matches the output.

4. Keep track of the largest end\_index offset:
   - From step 3, the largest offset seen is 6 (calculated as `9 - 3`, where 3 is the original end\_index value for the size-3 object), but in the final output, the largest offset is 4 (calculated as `14 - 10`). This indicates an inconsistency in applying the transformation rules.

5. After processing all objects, adjust the end\_index of single-pixel objects (size 1):
   - Since there is no information about `max_offset`, I assume it would be calculated as mentioned earlier. However, even with this assumption, the final result does not seem consistent with the expected outcome. Based on the previous calculation in step 4, Object\_3's end\_index should have been 14 instead of 15.

Considering these observations, I rate the accuracy of the test output as 7 out of 10 due to the inconsistent application of transformation rules, particularly regarding the `max_offset`.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output:

First, we note that the dimensions are correct for both the input and output, which is [1, 32].

Next, we analyze the objects in the output:

1. Object_1: {color: 1, start\_index: 1, end\_index: 8, size: 3}
	* The size is 3, so we expect the end\_index to be adjusted according to the transformation steps. Comparing the input and output, the end\_index increased by 5, which aligns with the repeating pattern of incrementing by 2, then 3, and finally 2 again.
2. Object_2: {color: 1, start\_index: 6, end\_index: 7, size: 1}
	* This object had its end\_index changed from 6 to 7. Since there is no next object or it doesn't meet the condition, and since this object has a size of 1, the end\_index remains unchanged.
3. Object_3: {color: 1, start\_index: 10, end\_index: 15, size: 1}
	* This object had its end\_index changed from 10 to 15. Given the transformation steps, this change can be attributed to the maximum offset calculated from other objects with size 3.

Lastly, we verify if the single-pixel objects received end\_index values equal to their starting index plus the maximum offset. Here, the maximum offset would be 5, as calculated from Object_1's transformation. Both Object_2 and Object_3 have end\_index values matching this criterion (6+5=11 and 10+5=15).

Considering all these factors, the transformation seems to have been applied correctly. However, please note that without actually implementing and testing the code, our evaluation relies on the interpretation of the given rules, patterns, and examples.

{'test\_output\_analysis': 'The transformation appears to have been applied correctly to the test input based on the given rules, patterns, and examples.', 'value': 10}
------
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output:

1. Iterate through each object in the input sequence:
   - Object_1: {'color': 1,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8,'size': 3}
   - Object_2: {'color': 1,'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 7,'size': 1}
   - Object_3: {'color': 1,'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 15,'size': 1}

2. Check the size of each object:
   - Object_1 has a size of 3.
   - Object_2 and Object_3 have a size of 1.

3. Process Object_1 (size = 3):
   - End_index set to start_index + 2 => 1 + 2 = 3
   - Increment the end_index by 3 => 3 + 3 = 6
   - Increment the end_index by 2 => 6 + 2 = 8
   - Maximum offset (max_offset) is 6 - 1 = 5.

4. Process Object_2 (size = 1):
   - Since the next object (Object_3) has a size of 1, we need to compare end_index to the start_index + max_offset.
     - Condition passes because 7 < 16 (10 + 5).
   - Therefore, the end_index remains unchanged at 7.

5. Process Object_3 (size = 1):
   - Since the next object does not exist, use the max_offset (5) calculated earlier.
   - Set end_index to start_index + max_offset: 10 + 5 = 15.

The provided test output seems to follow the specified transformation pattern and steps accurately. However, there is one minor inconsistency in the explanation of the transformation steps compared to the actual calculation of max_offset in step 3. The difference between the new end_index value (8) and the original start_index value (1) is actually 7 instead of 6. Nonetheless, since the final result is still correct, this discrepancy can be considered negligible.

transformation steps: [{'step': 'Iterate through each object in the input', 'description': 'For each object in the input sequence, perform the specified transformation steps.'}, {'step': 'Increase object size', 'description': "Increment the 'end_index' value of the current object by 2, effectively increasing its size by 2."}, {'step': "Check if increased 'end_index' exceeds sequence length", 'description': "If the incremented 'end_index' is greater than the sequence length, adjust it back to the last index of the sequence. This avoids out-of-bounds errors when working with variable-length sequences."}]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32]
transformed objects: [{"color": 1, "start_index": 1, "end_index": 6, "size": 5}, {"color": 1, "start_index": 6, "end_index": 8, "size": 3}, {"color": 1, "start_index": 10, "end_index": 12, "size": 3}]
