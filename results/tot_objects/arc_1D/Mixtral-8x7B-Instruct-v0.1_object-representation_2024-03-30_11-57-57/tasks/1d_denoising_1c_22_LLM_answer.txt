#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}

Overall, I found the given conditions and patterns to be accurate and precise in describing the transformation required for each example. My only concern is that the minimum cluster size is not explicitly provided, so the pattern cannot be fully evaluated without knowing this value.

 Here's the JSON response as requested:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes. They specify removing small connected components of similar colored pixels, leaving only larger ones.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern does describe the transformation from input to output correctly. It identifies and removes small connected components based on a minimum cluster size, resulting in the desired output.",
    "precision_analysis": "The given overall pattern seems precise enough to transform a new input to its output. However, the exact value of the minimum cluster size needs to be provided to achieve accurate results.",

    "overall_pattern_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "precision_analysis": "Same as Example_1",
    "value": 8
  }
}
```

In each example, the conditions are relevant to determining the object changes and accurately describe the transformation process. The overall pattern appears precise, but without specifying the minimum cluster size, we cannot precisely apply the transformation. Therefore, I rated them at a value of 8 instead of 10.

overall pattern:
conditions: Analyzing the previous examples, the primary condition determining whether objects remain or merge seems tied to their continuity and available space; objects disconnected from adjacent instances tend to disappear, whereas connected groups persist or merge. Merged instances typically maintain their original shape but shift in response to nearby empty spaces.
overall pattern: Scan through the input sequence searching for the longest chain(s) of consecutive pixels sharing the same color. Remove all other shorter chains. If multiple maximal chains exist, prioritize those closest to the initial chain and merge them accordingly, adjusting their relative positions depending on available space in the final composition.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!

In general, the given conditions and overall pattern seem to be well-defined and applicable to the provided examples. However, there is some ambiguity in the definition of the 'certain distance', which could impact the precision of the pattern. To ensure accurate evaluation, this concept needs further clarification.

```

The value ratings provided above reflect the level of detail and clarity of the given overall pattern and conditions. A higher value indicates more confidence in the applicability and usefulness of the given rules in transforming new inputs based on the observed patterns. However, due to the limited specification of the 'certain distance' mentioned in the overall pattern, the value was rated lower (7 out of 10). Providing a concrete formula or rule for this distance can improve the precision and thus increase the value rating.

Overall, I find the given pattern to be accurate and well-defined, making it easy to apply to any input sequence. However, there's still room for improvement in terms of precision. While the general idea is clear, certain specific aspects could benefit from further clarification, such as what constitutes a'small' or 'big' group, or how exactly to measure an object's isolation level.

Overall, the given pattern provides clear guidelines for identifying and removing smaller, isolated object clusters while preserving larger, contiguous ones. However, without more specific rules (e.g., minimum size threshold), there may still be some ambiguity in applying the pattern consistently across various inputs.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 10, 'end_index': 24, 'size': 15}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}, Object_5: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 14}

overall pattern:
conditions: Given an input sequence of pixel objects, those with a smaller size and relatively isolated compared to bigger groups will likely be removed in the resulting output. Thus, maintaining continuous sections and eliminating scattered areas seems to be the main principle behind this transformation.
overall pattern: To transform an input into output: Identify separate small object clusters or individual small objects; Remove them based on given conditions focusing on color, position, and size. Ensure continuity and avoid isolation among remaining objects.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Analysis:
1. The test output contains only one object, which is consistent with step 1 of looping through each object in the input sequence.
2. Based on the description provided in step 2, classifying objects based on size and isolation, the test output has only one object that is larger than the other two eliminated objects, hence satisfying this condition.
3. Since we don't have explicit information about how small and isolated objects were determined, it's difficult to assess step 3 entirely. However, since two objects were removed, it implies some sort of selection took place.
4. Again, due to limited information on validation conditions, it's challenging to thoroughly examine step 4. Nonetheless, assuming that appropriate conditions were met, the objects were removed.
5. With the two smaller objects removed, the test output now contains just one object, adhering to the filtering requirement in step 5.
6. The remaining object in the test output forms a contiguous section without gaps, aligning with step 6's need for maintaining contiguous sections.
7. Lastly, examining the resulting output sequence reveals no residual, isolated objects, thus fulfilling step 7's expectations.#############################

 {"test\_output\_analysis": "The test output appears to follow the correct format, with the dimensions, transformed objects, and individual object properties all present. To evaluate whether the transformation was applied correctly according to the provided rules, we will examine each step of the process.",
"value": "8"}

Step 1: Identify Connected Components
---------------------------------------

*   In the test input, there are three distinct connected components of color 2. They are located at positions 1-14, 18, and 23.
*   In the test output, only one connected component is shown, spanning from positions 1 to 18. This matches the first connected component identified in the test input.

Step 2: Calculate Component Size
-------------------------------

*   In the test input, the connected components have sizes 14, 1, and 1 respectively.
*   In the test output, the single connected component has a size of 18, which corresponds to the sum of the sizes of the matching connected components in the test input (14 + 1 + 1 = 16). However, since the two smallest components were merged, the actual size of the connected component is not accurate to the original data.

Step 3: Set Minimum Cluster Size
--------------------------------

*   Although no explicit minimum cluster size is mentioned in the provided information regarding the test case, the transformation steps include setting a parameter called `minimum cluster size`. It can be assumed that such a minimum exists but may differ from case to case.

Step 4: Remove Small Components
--------------------------------

*   As per the test output, two smaller components of color 2 were merged into the largest component. This indicates that the removal function worked as expected.

Overall Evaluation
------------------

*   While certain aspects of the transformation align with the intended results, discrepancies exist when examining the accuracy of component size calculations after merging. Nonetheless, considering the complexity of connecting and sizing the components while adhering to the provided rules, the test output appears mostly accurate and well-structured. Thus, I would rate the test output as **8 out of 10**.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the test input using the given transformation pattern and steps.

First, we perform connected component labeling on the input sequence. We can observe that there is one connected component with color 2 that spans index positions 1 through 14 and another two single-pixel connected components at positions 18 and 23.

Next, calculating the size of each connected component gives us three components: one with a size of 14 at position 1, one with a size of 1 at position 18, and one with a size of 1 at position 23.

Following the overall pattern, set the minimum cluster size as 10. As none of our identified connected components has a size less than 10, no removal is required.

Finally, returning the processed sequence results in the output being identical to the input since no changes were necessary according to the described transformation rules.

Comparing the actual test output to the expected result, they also happen to be identical even though no reduction or merging of connected components occurred. However, based on the given transformation pattern, the test output should contain only one object—the largest connected component. Therefore, applying the provided pattern strictly would lead to evaluating the test output as incorrect due to containing unnecessary additional objects.

{
  "test_output_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input was not correctly transformed into its test output. While the output contains correct information about connected components, it does not follow the specific guidelines outlined in the overall pattern regarding removing clusters under a certain size.",
  "value": 5
}
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output according to the given transformation instructions:

1. Identified Connected Components: In the test input, there are three connected components with color 2 at positions 1-14, 18, and 23. According to the test output, we can observe that one connected component is retained with color 2 at positions 1-14. This matches the first step of the transformation instructions.

 However, there seems to be an inconsistency in labeling connected components since the original input had separate components at positions 18 and 23, but they are merged in the test output.

2. Calculated Component Size: It appears that the test output analyzes the component size properly based on the single remaining component.

3. Minimum Cluster Size Parameter: There is no specific parameter mentioned in the test case; however, assuming that the minimum cluster size is set to 10 as suggested earlier, both components at positions 18 and 23 were removed due to being smaller than the minimum size.

4. Removed Small Components: Although the two components at positions 18 and 23 are merged with the larger connected component at positions 1-14, they appear to still be considered small components because setting the minimum cluster size to 10 would treat them as such. As previously stated, these smaller components seem merged rather than removed entirely.

To maintain consistency with the expected behavior, the test output should retain the separate components rather than merging them. Therefore, our assessment is as follows:

{
  "test\_output\_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input does not seem to be correctly transformed into its test output. Specifically, the identified connected components were likely labeled incorrectly, causing issues when applying other transformation steps.",
