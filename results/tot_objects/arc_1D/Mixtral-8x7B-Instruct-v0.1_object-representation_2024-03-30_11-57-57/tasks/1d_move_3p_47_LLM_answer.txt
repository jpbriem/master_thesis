#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 13}

Example_3:

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 17}

output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}


overall pattern:
conditions: For each example, the input object moves 3 units to the right based on its starting position. If the object cannot divide uniformly into sections when moving, then the final part will remain stationary in place.
overall pattern: An object will always maintain its original color and size during the movement. To apply this transformation on an input object: take note of its initial starting position; calculate the ending position after shifting the object to the right by 3 units; update the start and end indices accordingly; return the updated object.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 17}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 13}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, objects moved three units to the right, suggesting a rule related to the position of the object.
overall pattern: To transform an input into its output, find the objects in the input and shift their starting indices and ending indices by three units to the right. This will likely maintain the size of each object while changing its position.



transformation steps: ['Find the object in the input sequence.', 'Shift the start index of the object to the right by three positions.', 'Shift the end index of the object to the right by three positions.', 'Keep the color and size of the object unchanged.']

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!

 Based on the given information, here is the evaluation of the test output:

1. Find the object in the input sequence: The object in the input sequence is identified as Color 5 with Start Index 11 and End Index 13.
2. Shift the start index of the object to the right by three positions: If we shift the start index 3 units to the right, the new start index would be 14. However, the output does not provide this updated information.
3. Shift the end index of the object to the right by three positions: Similarly, if we shift the end index 3 units to the right, the new end index would be 16. Again, this updated information is missing in the output.
4. Keep the color and size of the object unchanged: There is no issue observed with respect to the color (Color 5) and size (3) of the object in the output.

Due to the lack of updated start and end indices in the output, it appears that the transformation was not fully applied to the test input. Therefore, I cannot provide a numerical rating above 0, but strongly advise revisiting the transformation process to ensure the correct updating of indices based on the rules provided.

{'test_output_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.

Based on the provided input `Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 5,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13,'size': 3}` and the overall pattern and transformation steps, we can infer the hypothetical output:

Hypothesized output: `Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 5,'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16,'size': 3}`

We follow these transformation steps:

1. Find the object in the input sequence. (Done - Color: 5; Start Index: 11; End Index: 13)
2. Shift the start index of the object to the right by three positions. (New Start Index: 11 + 3 = 14)
3. Shift the end index of the object to the right by three positions. (New End Index: 13 + 3 = 16)
4. Keep the color and size of the object unchanged. (Color remains 5; Size remains 3)

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 17}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 17}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 13}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 13}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 5}

overall pattern:
conditions: In all examples, objects moved three units to the right, suggesting a rule related to the position of the object.
overall pattern: To transform an input into its output, find the objects in the input and shift their starting indices and ending indices by three units to the right. This will likely maintain the size of each object while changing its position.


transformation steps: ['Find the object in the input sequence.', 'Shift the start index of the object to the right by three positions.', 'Shift the end index of the object to the right by three positions.', 'Keep the color and size of the object unchanged.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}

output: None

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, we can evaluate the test output as follows:

First, let's go through the transformation steps and see if they were applied correctly to the test input. However, since there is no provided test output, I will assume that the intended output would follow the same pattern as the examples.

1. Find the object in the input sequence: In the test input, the object is `{'color': 5,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13,'size': 3}`.
2. Shift the start index of the object to the right by three positions: In this step, the `start_index` should be increased by 3. So, the new `start_index` would be 11 + 3 = 14.
3. Shift the end index of the object to the right by three positions: Similarly, the `end_index` should be increased by 3. So, the new `end_index` would be 13 + 3 = 16.
4. Keep the color and size of the object unchanged: The color remains 5, and the size remains 3.

With these steps in mind, the expected test output should be: `Dimension: [1, 21], Object_1: {'color': 5,'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 16,'size': 3}`

However, the provided test output is `None`, which does not match our expected output based on the given patterns and steps. Therefore, it seems that the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input.

So, the output in json format would be:
```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
    "value": 0
}
```
------
 Here is the evaluation of the given test output and analysis of whether the transformation was applied correctly to the test input:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "For the given test input with an object of color 5 starting at index 11 and ending at index 13, the expected transformation would shift both the start and end indices of the object to the right by three positions. However, no output was provided to evaluate against this expected transformation.",
    "value": 0
}
```

Since there was no output provided to evaluate against the expected transformation, I cannot provide a rating higher than 0. If an output had been provided, I would have analyzed it for correctness based on the provided transformation steps and returned a rating between 0 and 10 accordingly.
