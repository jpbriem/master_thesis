The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 14], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 8}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 14], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 8}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 14], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 14], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 5}\n\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here is the JSON format response to your request:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"no change\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"the input and output objects have the same color (3) and size (4), but their position changed by 3 units to the right\",\n    \"conditions\": \"when an object's start index is less than or equal to 3, shift it to the right by 3 units\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"no change\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"the input and output objects have the same color (7) and size (8), but their position changed by 3 units to the right\",\n    \"conditions\": \"when an object's start index is less than or equal to 3, shift it to the right by 3 units\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"object_number\": \"no change\",\n    \"object_analysis\": \"the input and output objects have the same color (3) and size (5), but their position changed by 3 units to the right\",\n    \"conditions\": \"when an object's start index is less than or equal to 3, shift it to the right by 3 units\"\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": {\n    \"conditions\": \"when an object's start index is less than or equal to 3, shift it to the right by 3 units\",\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"for each object in the input, check if its start index is less than or equal to 3.

Check if `start_index` of Object\\_1 is less than 5: In this case, yes (it equals 1).\n2. Calculate the new `end_index` by adding the object size to the original `end_index`: New `end_index` = 8 + 8 = 16. However, note that the length of the array is only 14, so there might be an issue already.\n3. Set the new `start_index` to be the same as the old `end_index` plus one (to avoid overlapping): New `start_index` = 8 + 1 = 9. Again, consider the array length.\n4. Maintain the same color and size for the shifted object.\n5. Resulting output sequence would have the object shifted to the right by a fixed amount equal to its size assuming enough space beyond the original array.\n\nNow, compare the results above with the given test output. Since the expected new `end_index` is 13 based on the test output, but our calculation yields 16 considering the overall pattern, the result doesn't match. Moreover, even if the index correction were made, it still wouldn't fit inside the initial array since its length is just 14. Therefore, I cannot approve the given test output as being correct according to the specified transformation rules.\n\n{\n\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n\"value\": 3\n}\n------\n Based on the given information, let's evaluate the test output.\n\nFirst, we verify the overall pattern. According to the pattern, when an object's `start_index` is less than 5, it shifts to the right by a fixed amount equal to its size. In this specific test case, the input object has a `start_index` value of 1, which is indeed less than 5. Therefore, the object should shift to the right by its size (which is 8).\n\nNext, let's examine the provided test output based on the transformation steps:\n\n1. Check if every object in the input sequence meets the condition where `start_index` is less than 5. We find that the single object present does meet this criterion.\n2. Calculate the new `end_index` by adding the `current size` to the original `end_index`. Here, `8 + 8 = 16`, but since the sequence has a length of 14, we need to adjust this value accordingly - the adjusted value would be `(8 + 8) % 14 = 2`.\n3. Set the new `start_index` to be the same as the old `end_index`, plus the required shifting amount. This translates to `new_start_index = 8 + 8 = 16`, again needing adjustment due to the sequence's length. After adjustment, `new_start_index = (8 + 8) % 14 = 2`.\n4. Maintain the same color and size for the shifted object. Per the test output, the color remains 1, and the size remains 8.\n5. Observe the resulting output sequence to ensure the object is shifted to the right by a fixed amount equivalent to its size. Using our calculated `new_start_index`, the expected shifted object would appear like so: `[..., 0, 1, 1,..., 1, 1, 0,...]`, effectively shifting the existing object two indices to the right while keeping its color and size constant. However, the provided test output shows the object starting at index 8 instead of index 2, making it inconsistent with the specified rules.\n\nBased on these findings, there seems to be a mistake in the provided test output for the given input. The object did not shift according to the specified rules and remained at its initial position instead of moving two indices to the right. Consider this a *critical* observation regarding the discrepancy between the anticipated outcome and actual result.\n\nAs a conclusion, here's the output required in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze whether the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n    \"value\": 2\n}\n```\n\nNote: The \"value\" field indicates a low compliance score because the specified rules were not followed accurately concerning the object's displacement.\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

The original end\\_index was 8, and after shifting to the right by a size of 8, the new end\\_index should be 16 (given the length of the sequence is 14, starting index one).
