#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}

Example_3:

conditions: Given an input with several objects having the same color, objects with smaller sizes or that dont fall within a certain range will be removed. In each example, only one object remains, which is either the largest or in the middle of the input sequence.
overall pattern: For every unique color present in the input sequence, select the largest or middle object based on its size and location. Remove other objects with the same color while preserving their locations. This results in the final output containing only the selected objects with no additional modifications required.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}


overall pattern:
conditions: Given an input where objects may appear multiple times but never adjacent, objects with a size of 1 that aren t next to another object will be removed.
overall pattern: For every input, scan through the objects from left to right.

Overall, the given conditions and patterns seem accurate and complete enough to describe the relationship between the input and output sequences. However, there could still be some potential issues when implementing this transformation, such as handling overlapping objects or edge cases involving the first and last objects. Nonetheless, I rated the value at 9 out of 10 based on the information provided, as the overall pattern seems clear and concise.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: For all examples, an object with the given color retains when it contains more than two connected components; otherwise, the object is removed. This results in fewer objects post-transformation.
overall pattern: Transform each object in the input by checking the number of connected components. If there are more than two connected components, retain the object with the original properties (color, position, and size). Otherwise, remove the object (set its size to 0).

overall pattern: For every input, scan through the objects from left to right. If two consecutive objects dont meet the condition (not adjacent), then keep iterating until you find an object meeting the condition; otherwise, continue scanning. Remove all eligible objects by updating the output array accordingly.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: For all examples, an object with the given color retains when it contains more than two connected components; otherwise, the object is removed. This results in fewer objects post-transformation.
overall pattern: Transform each object in the input by checking the number of connected components. If there are more than two connected components, retain the object with the original properties (color, position, and size). Otherwise, remove the object (set its size to 0).

overall pattern: For every input, scan through the objects from left to right.

Remove all eligible objects by updating the output array accordingly.

 Based on the given input, here's the output description in JSON format:

```json
{
    "input_description": "The input contains one object of color 1, spanning from index 3 to 15 with a size of 13. There are also four smaller objects of color 1 at indices 19, 23, 27, and 30.",

        "transformed_objects": "[{\"color\": 1, \"start_index\": 3, \"end_index\": 15, \"size\": 13}]"
    }
}
```

Explanation:

* Input Description: We identify and mention each object's attributes in the input.
* Transformation: Since there are no adjacent objects of size 1, none of them satisfy the removal condition. Therefore, only the first object is retained in the output.
* Output: The output consists of a single object of color 1, occupying positions 3 to 15 with a size of 13.
------
 Based on the input description, there are 5 objects in the input sequence:
- Object_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 3, 'end\_index': 15,'size': 13}
- Object_2: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 19, 'end\_index': 19,'size': 1}
- Object_3: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 23, 'end\_index': 23,'size': 1}
- Object_4: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 27, 'end\_index': 27,'size': 1}
- Object_5: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 30, 'end\_index': 30,'size': 1}

Applying the transformation steps, we notice that Object_2, Object_3, Object_4, and Object_5 do not qualify as being adjacent to Object_1. Thus, these objects meet the removal condition and must be discarded. So, only Object_1 remains in the transformed output. Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
    "input_description": "The input contains a single object, Object_1, with color 1, spanning indices from 3 to 15, resulting in a length of 13.",
    "transformation": "Only Object_1 survives the removal step since none of the other smaller objects are adjacent to it. Therefore, the output includes Object_1, preserving its original size, position, and color.",
    "output": {
        "test_case_output_dimension": [1, 32],
        "transformed_objects": [{
            "color": 1,
            "start_index": 3,
            "end_index": 15,
            "size": 13
        }]
    }
}
```
------
 Based on the input description, there are 5 objects with color 1. Here's their breakdown:
- Object_1: Color 1, starts at index 3, ends at index 15, size 13
- Object_2: Color 1, starts at index 19, ends at index 19, size 1
- Object_3: Color 1, starts at index 23, ends at index 23, size 1
- Object_4: Color 1, starts at index 27, ends at index 27, size 1
- Object_5: Color 1, starts at index 30, ends at index 30, size 1

Applying the provided transformation steps:
- Initialize an empty output array with the same dimension as the input: Done.
- Iterate through each object in the input's objects list starting from the first one: Start with Object_1 (Color 1).
- Check if the current object meets the removal condition. Since Object_1 doesn't meet the condition, copy it to the output array: Copy object with Color 1, starts at index 3, ends at index 15, size 13.
- Repeat steps 3-5 for all remaining objects in the list. Let's check Object_2 (Color 1): It meets the removal condition since its size is 1 and isn't adjacent to any other object. Therefore, we skip it. Now let's check Object_3 (Color 1). It also meets the removal condition, so skip it. We do the same for Object_4 (Color 1) and Object_5 (Color 1).
- Return the final output array after processing all objects: Output array has Object_1 (Color 1), starts at index 3, ends at index 15, size 13.

Here's the JSON response:
```json
{
    "input_description": "There are 5 objects in total with color 1. One larger object spans indices 3 to 15, and 4 single-pixel objects located at indices 19, 23, 27, and 30.",

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: For all examples, an object with the given color retains when it contains more than two connected components; otherwise, the object is removed. This results in fewer objects post-transformation.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output:

First, let's go through each step of the transformation instructions:

1. Initialize an empty set to store the indices of objects to be removed: This step doesn't affect the visible outcome of the transformation, so it can't be verified directly.

2. Iterate over each object in the input sequence and check the number of connected components for each object using the given color: Again, this step isn't directly observable in the output. However, assuming the implementation is correct, it would proceed as follows:
   - Object_1 has 1 connected component (size 13), which is greater than 2. It should be retained.
   - The other objects (indices 2, 3, 4) have a size of 1, meaning they consist of a single pixel. These should be removed according to the rules mentioned in the overall pattern section.

3. Add the index of the object to the removal set if the number of connected components for an object is less than or equal to two: Assuming the previous step was implemented correctly, then indices 2, 3, and 4 should be present in the removal set since Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4 don't meet the criteria.

4. Create a new output sequence by iterating through the objects in the input sequence but excluding those marked for removal: In the output, only Object_1 is visible. This implies that indices 2, 3, and 4 (corresponding to Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4) were excluded during creation of the output sequence.

5. Set the sizes of any remaining objects that were included in the removal set to 0: Since Object_1 is the only visible object, the sizes of Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4 should be set to 0. This ensures they remain at their locations without affecting neighboring pixels visually. But since these "removed" objects aren't shown explicitly in the output, this aspect cannot be confirmed based solely on the information available.

Based on the above analysis, I suggest assigning a value of 9 out of 10 for the test output, deducting one point due to unverifiable aspects related to step 1 and partly to step 5, despite matching outcomes in other parts of the process.
------
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output.

First, let's go through each transformation step and see if it has been correctly applied to the test input.

1. Initialize an empty set to store the indices of objects to be removed.
   - Pass

2. Iterate over each object in the input sequence. Check the number of connected components for each object using the given color.
   - In the test case, there is only one color value (1), so assuming connected components mean adjacent pixels of the same color, the number of connected components for each object is just the size of each object.
   - Object_1: 13 connected components
   - Object_2 to Object_5: Each having 1 connected component

3. If the number of connected components for an object is less than or equal to two, add the index of the object to the removal set.
   - Since every object in the test case has only 1 connected component, all objects except Object_1 would fall under this category and get added to the removal set.

4. Create a new output sequence by iterating through the objects in the input sequence, but excluding those marked for removal.
   - After filtering out the objects based on the removal set, only Object_1 remains.

5. Set the sizes of any remaining objects that were included in the removal set to 0.
   - No other objects remain after applying the filter, so this step doesn't apply here.

Since the expected output matches what we obtained by manually going through the transformation steps, it seems like the test output was generated correctly according to the rules provided. However, since I can't directly observe how the implementation handles multiple color values and varying numbers (>2) of connected components, I cannot completely guarantee accuracy in general cases outside of this specific test scenario.

Giving a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output based on your analysis, I would rate it a **9**. It accurately follows the specified rules for this particular test case, but without observing how it works with various color values and connected components counts, I wouldn't want to give it a perfect score.

Given the evaluation above, I rate the test output as 8 out of 10 based on a correct application of most steps except for step 5, which wasn't necessary due to having no objects left. However, the primary objective of merging objects based on conditions was achieved successfully.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: For all examples, an object with the given color retains when it contains more than two connected components; otherwise, the object is removed. This results in fewer objects post-transformation.
overall pattern: Transform each object in the input by checking the number of connected components. If there are more than two connected components, retain the object with the original properties (color, position, and size). Otherwise, remove the object (set its size to 0).


transformation steps: [{'step': 'Initialize an empty set to store the indices of objects to be removed.', 'description': 'We need to keep track of the indices of objects that will be removed because they do not meet the condition.'}, {'step': 'Iterate over each object in the input sequence. Check the number of connected components for each object using the given color.', 'description': 'For each object, we calculate the number of connected components and compare it with the threshold value of two. Based on this comparison, we decide whether to retain or remove the object.'}, {'step': 'If the number of connected components for an object is less than or equal to two, add the index of the object to the removal set.', 'description': 'If an object does not meet the condition, we mark it for removal by adding its index to the removal set.'}, {'step': 'Create a new output sequence by iterating through the objects in the input sequence, but excluding those marked for removal.', 'description': 'When constructing the output sequence, we ignore the objects that were added to the removal set. Only include objects that satisfy the condition.'}, {'step': 'Set the sizes of any remaining objects that were included in the removal set to 0.', 'description': 'Objects that failed the condition must still appear in the output sequence, but their size should be set to 0, effectively removing them visually while preserving their location.'}]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output:

transformed objects: There are no objects in the output since all of them were removed due to having only one connected component.

1. Initialize an empty output array with the same dimension as the input:
   - Passed, since the dimensions match and there is no sign of alteration in the original input.

2. Iterate through each object in the input's objects list starting from the first one:
   - Passed, as the instruction clearly states to scan from left to right.

3. If the current object meets the removal condition, skip it:
   - The condition checks if an object has a size of 1 and isn't adjacent to any other object. In our test case, Object_2, Object_3, Object_4, and Object_5 fulfill this condition and get skipped. Only Object_1 remains, so the removal condition appears to work as intended.
   
4. Copy the current object to the output array at the correct position:
   - Passed, as the output contains a single object identical to the input's Object_1.

5. Repeat steps 3-5 for all remaining objects in the list:
   - As mentioned earlier, all other objects were skipped due to the removal condition. Therefore, repeating these steps won't affect the outcome.

6. Return the final output array after processing all objects:
   - Passed, as the provided transformed objects match the expected output.

Overall, the test output can be considered as correct based on the given transformation instructions.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output against the test input using the given transformation pattern and steps. In this case, the test output is `None`, indicating no objects should remain after applying the transformation.

Let's go through each step in the transformation process:

1. Initialize an empty output array with the same dimension as the input:
   - Since we don't see an explicit output here, assume there is an empty output array created.

2. Iterate through each object in the input's objects list starting from the first one:
   - We have 5 objects; let's examine them one-by-one:
     1. Object_1 has a size of 13 and starts at index 3.
     2. Object_2 has a size of 1 and starts at index 19.
     3. Object_3 has a size of 1 and starts at index 23.
     4. Object_4 has a size of 1 and starts at index 27.
     5. Object_5 has a size of 1 and starts at index 30.

3. If the current object meets the removal condition, skip it:
   - Condition: The current object has size 1 and is not adjacent to any other object.
     - Object_2, Object_3, Object_4, and Object_5 all have sizes of 1 and do not meet the condition since they are not adjacent to other objects. Therefore, these objects should be removed.

4. Copy the current object to the output array at the correct position:
   - Not applicable for this case, as no objects meet the criteria and thus none should be copied over.

5. Repeat steps 3-5 for all remaining objects in the list:
   - As previously mentioned, all objects except Object_1 were skipped due to the removal condition. So, we can conclude that Object_1 should also be removed because it does not meet the condition (being the largest single connected component).

6. Return the final output array after processing all objects:
   - Since there are no objects remaining based on our evaluation, the output should indeed be `None`.

Test Output Analysis:
Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input appears to have been correctly transformed into its test output. It seems like the transformation rules were properly followed, resulting in no remaining objects in the output array.

Value: 10 (based on perfect adherence to the given rules)
------
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output and the analysis of the transformation:

The input sequence is: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

The given transformation pattern states that objects with size 1 that are not adjacent to another object will be removed. Let's evaluate the test output based on the given transformation steps and this input.

According to the transformation pattern and steps, let's go through them one-by-one:

1. Initialize an empty output array with the same dimension as the input - In our case, dimensions stay the same as the input: [1, 32]. Since there's no output provided, I assume the output array should be initialized but not filled yet.

2. Iterate through each object in the input's objects list starting from the first one - We can identify four eligible objects after analyzing the input:
   - Object_1: {'color': 1,'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15,'size': 13}
   - Object_2: {'color': 1,'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19,'size': 1}
   - Object_3: {'color': 1,'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23,'size': 1}
   - Object_4: {'color': 1,'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30,'size': 1}
   
3. If the current object meets the removal condition, skip it - According to the provided input, none of these objects meet the removal condition since they all have size 1. Therefore, none of them should be skipped.

4. Copy the current object to the output array at the correct position - This step requires adding objects to the output array considering their relative positions. Although no explicit output array is given, assuming it follows the rules mentioned above, the resulting output array would look like this:
   Output Array = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

5. Repeat steps 3-5 for all remaining objects in the list - As previously stated, none of the objects meet the removal condition, so no further filtering is necessary during this pass. However, objects must still be copied to the output array properly. Here is how the output array would look after copying all objects:
   Output Array = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

6. Return the final output array after processing all objects - Considering the previous assumption about filling the output array, the expected output would be:
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Since the actual test output is None, the test output doesn't match the expected outcome. It seems the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input.

  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}

overall pattern:
conditions: Given an input where objects may appear multiple times but never adjacent, objects with a size of 1 that aren t next to another object will be removed.
overall pattern: For every input, scan through the objects from left to right. If two consecutive objects dont meet the condition (not adjacent), then keep iterating until you find an object meeting the condition; otherwise, continue scanning. Remove all eligible objects by updating the output array accordingly.
