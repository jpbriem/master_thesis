#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 9}

output: Dimension: [1, 29], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 11}

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

overall pattern:
conditions: objects of a certain color will shift their starting and ending indices by 3 if they start at an index before the increased start_index and end after the increased end_index.
overall pattern: for each object in the input, check the color and position. If the object starts before the increased start_index and ends after the increased end_index, increase both start_index and end_index by 3. This results in the same size. The color remains unchanged.

In summary, the provided overall pattern generally describes the relationship between input and output for all three examples. However, there is some ambiguity in the terminology used, specifically in the meaning of 'increased start\_index' and 'increased end\_index'. To improve the precision of the overall pattern, these terms should be better defined, allowing users to confidently apply the pattern to new inputs.

Shift each object three indices to the right while preserving their original color and size.For instance, consider an input object with color c, starting index s, and end index e:- Preserve the color c.- Compute the new start and end indices (s_new = s + 3, e_new = e + 3)- Ensure the new indices do not exceed the array bounds.Apply these steps to every object within the input, resulting in the desired output.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

###########################################################
Sample Outputs:
 Based on the given input, here is the description of the objects in the input:

* There is one object (Object\_1) in the input, with color 2, starting at index 6 and ending at index 21, giving it a total size of 16.

Following the given transformation steps, we can determine what the objects will look like after the transformation has been applied:

* First, we iterate over each object in the input sequence. In this case, there is only one object (Object\_1).
* We then calculate the desired shift as one third of the object size, rounded down. Here, the size of Object\_1 is 16, so the desired shift would be 5 (rounded down from 5.33).
* Next, we update the object's start index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (less than the sequence length - object size). After adding 5 to the start index of 6, we get 11. This value is still within the valid range of the input sequence, since 11 < 29 - 16 = 13.
* Finally, we update the object's end index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (greater than or equal to 0). After adding 5 to the end index of 21, we get 26. However, this value is not within the valid range of the input sequence, since 26 > 29. To correct this, we set the end index to be equal to the updated start index plus the size of the object minus 1. So, the end index is set to 11 + 16 - 1 = 26 - 2 = 24.

Therefore, after applying the transformation steps, the test output will have the following objects:

* Object\_1: {'color': 2,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 24,'size': 16}

And the final output will be:

{
'input\_description': 'Objects in the input include one object (Object\_1) with color 2, starting at index 6 and ending at index 21, giving it a total size of 16.',
'transformation': 'After applying the transformation steps, Object\_1 has moved to the right by 5 units, resulting in a new start index of 11 and a new end index of 24. Its color remains unchanged.',
'output': {
'test\_case\_output\_dimension': [1, 29],
'transformed\_objects': '[Object\_1: {"color": 2, "start\_index": 11, "end\_index": 24, "size": 16}]'
}
}
------
 Based on the given input, here is the description of the objects present in the input:

* Input Description: In the input sequence, there is one object, Object\_1 with color 2. It starts at index 6 and ends at index 21, making its size 16.

Following the overall pattern and the transformation steps, we perform the required operations on the input object.

* Transformation: Iterating through each object, we first calculate the desired shift as one third of the object size rounded down. Here, 16 / 3 = 5.33, so we take 5 as our shift value. We then add the shift value to both the start and end indices of the object while ensuring they remain within the valid range. So, the new start index becomes `min(sequence_length - object_size, current_start_index + shift)` (which is min(29-16, 6+5)=11)), and the new end index becomes `max(0, current_end_index + shift)` (which is max(0, 21+5)=26). This results in updated positions of the object without violating any conditions.

Here is the final transformed output along with details about the formed objects.

* Output:
	+ test\_case\_output\_dimension: [1, 29]
	+ transformed\_objects: Object\_1: {'color': 2,'start\_index': 11, 'end\_index': 26,'size': 16}
------
 Based on the given input, here is the description of the objects in the input:
"There is one object with color 2, starting from index 6 and ending at index 21, making its size 16."

Following the transformation steps, we first calculate the desired shift for the object, which is one third of its size (rounded down). So, 16/3 = 5 (rounded down). Then, we update the start index of the object by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (i.e., less than the sequence length - object size). In this case, the updated start index would be 6 + 5 = 11. Similarly, we update the end index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (i.e., greater than or equal to 0). In this case, the updated end index would be 21 + 5 = 26. Therefore, the transformed object would look like this:
"Transformed object: {'color': 2,'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 26,'size': 16}"

And the output for the test case would be:
{"test\_case\_output\_dimension": [1, 29], "transformed\_objects": {"Object\_1": {"color": 2, "start\_index": 11, "end\_index": 26, "size": 16}}}
------
 Based on the given information, here's the output for the test case:

```json
{
  "input_description": "In the input, there is one object (color 2) that spans from index 6 to 21, covering a total of 16 positions.",
  "transformation": "For each object, the starting index will be shifted to the right by an amount equal to one third of the object size, rounded down. However, the shift cannot exceed the length of the sequence minus the object size. Applying this rule, object_1 will be shifted 5 units to the right, resulting in a new span from index 11 to 26. Since the sequence has only 29 positions, we adjust the end index to 21 (the original end index plus the allowed shift).",

Shift each object three indices to the right while preserving their original color and size.For instance, consider an input object with color c, starting index s, and end index e:- Preserve the color c.- Compute the new start and end indices (s_new = s + 3, e_new = e + 3)- Ensure the new indices do not exceed the array bounds.Apply these steps to every object within the input, resulting in the desired output.


transformation steps: [ '1. Find all objects in the input sequence.', '2. Iterate over each object found:', '   2.1. Preserve the color of the current object.', '   2.2. Compute the new start and end indices by adding three to the current ones (s_new = s + 3, e_new = e + 3).', '   2.3. Ensure the new indices do not exceed the array bounds.' '3. Apply these steps to every object within the input, resulting in the desired output.' ] 


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 29], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 16}

 Here is the analysis of the given test output:

```json
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
  "value": 4
}
```

Explanation:

* Step 1: Iterate over each object in the input sequence. This step is not applicable since there is only one object in the input sequence.
* Step 2: Calculate the desired shift as one third of the object size (rounded down). The size of the object is 16, so the desired shift would be 16 / 3 = 5.33 (rounded down to 5). However, the shift cannot exceed the length of the sequence minus the object size, i.e., 29 - 16 = 13. Therefore, the actual shift should be 5.
* Step 3: Update the object's start index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (i.e., less than the sequence length - object size). The new start index should be 6 + 5 = 11, which is within the valid range.
* Step 4: Update the object's end index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (i.e., greater than or equal to 0). The new end index should be 21 + 5 = 26, which is outside the valid range since the sequence has a length of 29. The correct new end index should be 21 + 3 = 24, since the maximum allowed shift is 3 (as explained in Step 2 above).
* Overall, the transformation was not applied correctly to the test input because the updated end index is outside the valid range. Therefore, I rate the test output a 4 out of 10.

 Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
    "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
    "value": 4
}
```

Explanation:

1. Iterate over each object in the input sequence: Not applicable since there is only one object in the test case.
2. Calculate the desired shift as one third of the object size (rounded down): Shift = floor(size / 3) = floor(16 / 3) = 5.
3. Update the object's start index by adding the calculated shift: New start index = original start index + shift = 6 + 5 = 11. However, the new value is out of bounds (outside the range [0, 28]). Hence, the transformation was incorrectly applied.
4. Update the object's end index by adding the calculated shift: New end index = original end index + shift = 21 + 5 = 26. This would also result in an invalid value (outside the range [0, 28]). Hence, the transformation was incorrectly applied.
5. Repeat these steps for all objects in the input sequence: N/A (only one object).

Given that the transformation produced out-of-bounds errors, I rated the test output a 4 because at least some parts of the process were followed (the calculation of the shift based on one third of the object size). If none of the steps had been implemented correctly, I would have assigned a score of 0.

Explanation:

1. Find all objects in the input sequence: In this case, there is one object in the input sequence - Object_1 with color 2, start\_index 6, end\_index 21, and size 16. This object has been identified correctly in the test output.
2. Iterate over each object found:
   - 2.1. Preserve the color of the current object: The color of the object in the test output remains unchanged at 2.
   - 2.2. Compute the new start and end indices by adding three to the current ones (s\_new = s + 3, e\_new = e + 3): In the test case, the start\_index is 6, so the new start\_index would be 9. Similarly, the end\_index is 21, so the new end\_index would be 24. These have been calculated correctly in the test output.
   - 2.3. Ensure the new indices do not exceed the array bounds: Both the new start\_index (9) and end\_index (24), which were obtained after adding three to the initial indices, fall within the array bounds of dimensions 1x29. Therefore, this condition holds true for the test output.

Since each of the above steps has been followed precisely, without any discrepancies between the test input and its corresponding output, we can rate the test output as 10 out of 10.
