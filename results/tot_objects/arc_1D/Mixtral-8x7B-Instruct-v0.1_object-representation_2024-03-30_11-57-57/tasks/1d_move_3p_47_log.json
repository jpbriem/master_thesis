It identifies that the objects in the input sequence move three units to the right in order to produce the output sequence. Additionally, the conditions specified are relevant to the problem and apply consistently across all examples. Overall, I would rate the precision and accuracy of the pattern highly (8 or above out of 10).\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

If the object cannot divide uniformly into sections when moving, then the final part will remain stationary in place.\noverall pattern: An object will always maintain its original color and size during the movement. To apply this transformation on an input object: take note of its initial starting position; calculate the ending position after shifting the object to the right by 3 units; update the start and end indices accordingly; return the updated object.\n\n[/INST]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n {\"Example\\_1\": {\"conditions\\_analysis\": \"The given condition for Example\\_1 states that the input object moves 3 units to the right based on its starting position.

Firstly, the object in the input sequence was accurately identified as having a color of 5 and spanning from indices 11 to 13. Next, the start index of the object was shifted to the right by three positions, resulting in a new start index of 14. Similarly, the end index of the object was also shifted to the right by three positions, yielding a new end index of 16. Finally, the color (5) and size (3) of the object remained unaltered throughout the process, ensuring the integrity of the original data.
