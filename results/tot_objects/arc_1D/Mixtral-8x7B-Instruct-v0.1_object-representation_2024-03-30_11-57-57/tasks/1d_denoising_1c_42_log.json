            "prompt_log": "#############################\nFirst node, get samples:\n#############################Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 12}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 13}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 13}\n\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Example\\_1:\nobject\\_number: The number of objects decreased from 4 to 1.\nobject\\_analysis: The object with color 2 and start\\_index 9 changed by increasing its size from 1 to 12.\nconditions: If an object has color 2 and there is another object with the same color to its left, then it increases its size to connect with the adjacent object of the same color. All other objects with color 2 are removed.\n\nExample\\_2:\nobject\\_number: The number of objects remained the same, but their arrangement changed.\nobject\\_analysis: The object with color 8 and start\\_index 1 increased its size from 14 to 18 (by including two noise pixels) while retaining its original color.\nconditions: If an object has color 8 and there is a gap between this object and another object with the same color, then include the gap within the current object's size until it reaches the next object with the same color. This results in connecting all the objects with color 8.\n\nExample\\_3:\nobject\\_number: The number of objects remained the same, but their arrangement changed.\nobject\\_analysis: The object with color 3 and start\\_index 16 changed by increasing its size from 1 to 13, thus covering more continuous pixels with the same color.\nconditions: Similar to Example\\_2, if an object has color 3 and there is a gap between this object and another object with the same color, then include the gap within the current object's size until it reaches the next object with the same color.\n\noverall\\_pattern:\nconditions: When processing any input, examine each object based on its color. Include gaps between objects with the same color when possible, removing non-contiguous objects with the same color. Specifically, if an object has color C and it can expand its size to reach another object with the same color C, then increase its size accordingly. By doing so, you will retain only one contiguous object per color category. Additionally, if the input consists solely of noise pixels (value 0), no objects will emerge after applying these rules.\n------\n Example\\_1:\nobject\\_number: The number of objects decreased from 4 to 1.\nobject\\_analysis: The object with color 2 and start/end index 9 was moved to the left by 5 indices, increasing its size from 1 to 12. Other objects were removed.\nconditions: The objects with color 2 at the edges (positions 4 and 29) were removed along with the single-pixel object at position 25. This suggests a condition where objects at the edge or too small get removed.\n\nExample\\_2:\nobject\\_number: The number of objects did not change; there is one large object of color 8.\nobject\\_analysis: The two smaller objects (positions 18 and 23) were kept while the larger object (position 1) remained unchanged. No merging occurred.\nconditions: Large continuous objects are preserved regardless of their starting position. Smaller objects are removed unless they're next to a larger object.\n\nExample\\_3:\nobject\\_number: The number of objects stayed the same, going from 2 to 2.\nobject\\_analysis: Only the leftmost object (color 3, position 3) got removed. There is no merge or relocation.\nconditions: Small isolated objects seem more likely to be deleted.\n\noverall\\_pattern:\nconditions: Small isolated objects and objects near the edges are prone to removal. Larger contiguous objects tend to persist regardless of location. Relocating objects often involves placing them towards the center of other adjacent objects. Merging does not appear significant in this context.\noverall\\_pattern: Given an input sequence, isolate individual objects according to their colors. Apply the following operations:\n\n* Remove objects that meet these conditions:\n\t+ Are single-pixel objects within the sequence but not connected to another larger object.\n\t+ Are located close to either endpoint.\n* If multiple objects remain, prioritize moving objects toward each other by updating the `start_index` property:\n\t+ Move lower `start_index` to higher ones.\n\t+ Keep the original order of objects; i.e., avoid swapping colors during movement.\n------\n {'Example\\_1': {'object\\_number': 'The number of objects decreased from 4 to 1.

This assumption may not hold true for all possible inputs, so some care should be taken when applying the pattern more broadly.\n* Example 3 has only one object per color, so the overall pattern works trivially in this case.

When comparing objects, consider their potential overlap and ensure that non-overlapping objects remain separate in the output.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: [{'step': 'For each object in the input, calculate its size by subtracting its start_index from its end_index plus one (to include both the starting and ending indices)', 'condition': 'There are one or more objects in the input', 'effect': 'Calculates the size of each object'}, {'step': 'Sort the objects in descending order based on their calculated sizes', 'condition': 'There are two or more objects in the input', 'effect': 'Orders the objects from largest to smallest size'}, {'step': 'Initialize an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input', 'condition': 'Input has been provided', 'effect': 'Creates an empty array to store the result of the transformation'}, {'step': 'Iterate through the sorted list of objects', 'condition': 'Objects exist in the input and output array has been initialized', 'effect': 'Processes each object individually'}, {'step': \"If this object is the first object in the sorted list OR it does not overlap with any previously added objects, add this object's data to the output array at the appropriate location\", 'condition': 'Input contains objects and output array has been initialized', 'effect': 'Adds the first object or non-overlapping objects to the output array'}, {'step': \"Update the position information for subsequent iterations based on the current object's end index + 1 (to avoid overlap)\", 'condition': 'Processing objects in the loop', 'effect': 'Prevents adding overlapping objects to the output array'}]\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

Move the remaining small object at index 29 to the right side of the large object.

Consequently, there will be a gap where the second small object was originally positioned.\n------\n Based on the provided information, here's the transformation for the test case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"input_description\": \"The input contains one object of color 3, spanning from index 1 to 15 (size 15), and three smaller objects of color 3 at indices 19, 24, and 29 (sizes 1 each).\",\n  \"transformation\": \"In the output, there will be one object of color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 15 (size 15).

In this case, there is only one transformed object, as the others do not meet the condition to be moved.\n------\n Based on the provided information, here's the JSON response for the test case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"input_description\": \"The input contains one large object of color 3, spanning from index 1 to 15 (size: 15), and three small objects of color 3, each of size 1 at indices 19, 24, and 29.\",\n  \"transformation\": \"In the test output, there will be one large object of color 3, starting at index 1 and ending at index 15 (size: 15).\",\n  \"output\": {\n    \"test_case_output_dimension\": [1, 32],\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"Object_1: {'color': 3,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 15,'size': 15}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBased on the previous examples, it seems like the transformation involves keeping the largest object while removing smaller ones. I made this assumption since no specific transformation steps were provided and all examples followed the same pattern of retaining the largest object.\n------\n Based on the provided information, here's the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"input_description\": \"The input contains four objects with color 3. Object_1 has a size of 15, starting at index 1 and ending at index 15. Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4 have sizes of 1, located at indices 19, 24, and 29 respectively.\",\n  \"transformation\": \"In the output, only Object_1 remains, having been moved and resized. It now starts at index 16 and ends at index 30, maintaining a size of 15.\",\n  \"output\": {\n    \"test_case_output_dimension\": [1, 32],\n    \"transformed_objects\": \"Object_1: {'color': 3,'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 30,'size': 15}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis output suggests that the first object in the input is moved and resized to span from index 16 to 30 (inclusive) in the output.

According to the transformation steps, we need to follow these steps after calculating the object sizes:\n\n1. Sort the objects in descending order based on their size.\n2. Create an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input.\n3. Iterate through the sorted list of objects.\n4. Add the first object or objects that don't overlap to the output array.\n5. Update the position information for subsequent iterations based on the current object's end index + 1.\n\nAfter applying these steps, here's the transformation description:\n\nIn the test output, we expect a single object consisting of connected and non-overlapping regions derived from the initial set of objects in the input.

In contrast, the test output contains an object encompassing all instances of color 3. To evaluate this test output, we will consider each step of the (implied) transformation instructions and determine whether the test input has been correctly transformed into its output.\n\nTo begin with, let's extract the relevant information from both the input and output of the test case:\n\nTest case input:\nDimension: [1, 32]\nObjects:\n- Object_1: {'color': 3,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 15,'size': 15}\n- Object_2: {'color': 3,'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19,'size': 1}\n- Object_3: {'color': 3,'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24,'size': 1}\n- Object_4: {'color': 3,'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29,'size': 1}\n\nTest case output:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 32]\ntransformed objects: [{'color': 3,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 29,'size': 29}]\n\nAccording to the implied transformation rule, the output should retain only the object(s) with the largest size(s). However, in the test case output, all instances of color 3 are grouped together despite the presence of smaller objects in the original input. This behavior contradicts the established rule based on the examples provided at the beginning.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, I would rate the accuracy of the test output as follows:\n\n{\n\"test_output_analysis\": \"Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n\"value\": 4\n}\n------\n Based on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves keeping only the object with the largest size and removing the others. In the test case, there are four objects given in the input, but only one object is present in the output. Let's evaluate whether the output was obtained by applying this transformation correctly to the input.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the size of each object in the input:\n\n* Object\\_1: 15\n* Object\\_2: 1\n* Object\\_3: 1\n* Object\\_4: 1\n\nNow, we can see that Object\\_1 has the largest size (15), so according to the observed pattern, the output should contain only this object. Indeed, the output does include an object with a size covering the entire range of indices present in the original objects (i.e., 1 to 29).\n\nSince the output matches the expected pattern based on the input, I would rate the transformation process as correct, giving a value of 10.\n\nTherefore, the final result in JSON format is:\n\n{'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Considering the transformation instructions and comparing them with the test input, it seems that the transformation was applied correctly.

If there is a tie for the largest size, then one of the tied objects is kept and the others are discarded. This behavior can be observed in Examples 1 and 2, where multiple objects with the same color are present but only one is retained in the output. Example 3 shows a similar scenario but with a single color value.\n\nApplying this interpretation to the test case, we find that:\n\n* Input: `Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 15,'size': 15}, Object_2: {'color': 3,'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19,'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3,'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 24,'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3,'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29,'size': 1}`\n* Output:\n\t+ Test case output dimension: [1, 32]\n\t+ Transformed objects: [{'color': 3,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 15,'size': 15}]\n\nAccording to the transformation rules described above, the output appears correct since the object with color 3 having the largest size (15) is preserved while the other smaller objects with the same color are removed.

We see that there is one object in the output sequence: `[{'color': 3,'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 15,'size': 15}]`. By comparing this with the input objects, it appears that the first object has been combined from three separate ones (with indices 1-15, 19, and 24) into a single object spanning indices 1-15. This means that two out of the four original objects have been included entirely within the new object (objects 1 and 3). However, parts of two other objects (2 and 4) were left out during the merging process.

If multiple objects have the same largest size, then the first such object is selected.\n\nApplying this interpretation to the test case, we can see that the first object has the largest size (15), so all other objects of the same color (color 3) will be combined into one object. The resulting object's start\\_index will be the minimum of the start\\_indices of the original objects, which is 1. The end\\_index will be the maximum of the end\\_indices of the original objects, which is 30.

Thus, the test output cannot be considered correct.\n\nAnswer:\n{\n'test\\_output\\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation instructions, it seems that the goal of the transformation is to combine all objects of the same color except the one with the largest size into one single object.

All of them involve removing smaller objects made up of a single color while keeping one larger object intact. In this context, we will evaluate the correctness of the test output based on whether it follows the observed pattern of retaining only the largest connected component (object) with a specific color and eliminating other smaller components.\n\nNow, let us compare the input and output of the test case:\n\nInput:\nDimension: [1, 32]\nObjects:\n- Object\\_1: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 15,'size': 15}\n- Object\\_2: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 19, 'end\\_index': 19,'size': 1}\n- Object\\_3: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 24, 'end\\_index': 24,'size': 1}\n- Object\\_4: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 29, 'end\\_index': 29,'size': 1}\n\nOutput:\ntest case output dimension: [1, 32]\ntransformed objects: Object\\_1: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 16, 'end\\_index': 30,'size': 15}\n\nIn this particular scenario, there is only one large connected component of color 3 - the first object in the input. This corresponds to the expected result in the output - a single connected component with a size of 15. Therefore, the transformation appears to be consistent with the observed pattern in the examples and has been appropriately applied to the test input.\n\n{\n\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input was indeed correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n\"value\": 10\n}#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

Calculate the size of each object:\n   - Object 1: Size = 15\n   - Object 2: Size = 1\n   - Object 3: Size = 1\n   - Object 4: Size = 1\n2. Sort the objects in descending order based on their calculated sizes:\n   - Object 1: Size = 15\n   - Object 2: Size = 1\n   - Object 3: Size = 1\n   - Object 4: Size = 1\n3. Initialize an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input: In our case, since the input has dimensions [1, 32], so does the output array.\n4. Iterate through the sorted list of objects:\n5. Check if this object is the first object in the sorted list OR it does not overlap with any previously added objects. Add this object's data to the output array at the appropriate location:\n   - Object 1: Since it's the first object, it doesn't overlap with any previously added objects. We add this object to the output array covering indices 1 to 15.\n\nAt this point, we can see that the test output only includes the first object found in the input, but the overall pattern suggests that when multiple objects are present in the input, the output should include only the object with the largest size, unless there are no overlapping regions among the objects. However, in this case, even though Object 1 is larger than the others, it still overlaps with the remaining objects (2, 3, and 4). Therefore, according to the given pattern, none of the objects should be included in the final output due to the overlaps.\n\nSince the test output fails to meet the expected criteria considering the overall pattern and transformation steps, I recommend assigning a low rating for the test output quality.\n\n{'test_output_analysis': 'The test output failed to meet the expected criteria considering the overall pattern and transformation steps. None of the objects should have been included in the final output due to the overlaps. As a result, the test output requires improvement.', 'value': '2'}\n------\n Based on the given input and output for the test case along with the overall pattern and the detailed transformation steps, let's evaluate if the test output was arrived upon correctly by analyzing each step.\n\n1. Calculate the size of each object - Done\n2. Sort the objects in descending order based on their calculated sizes - Not needed since we only have one object with the largest size (size = 15)\n3. Initialize an empty output array with the same dimensions as the input - Done\n4. Iterate through the sorted list of objects (in our case, just one object) - Done\n5. Add the first object to the output array since it doesn't overlap with any previously added objects - Done\n6. Update the position information for subsequent iterations - Not applicable since we processed only one object\n\nNow let us verify if the output matches the expected outcome:\n\n* Input: Dimension: [1, 32], Object\\_1: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 15,'size': 15}, Object\\_2: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 19, 'end\\_index': 19,'size': 1}, Object\\_3: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 24, 'end\\_index': 24,'size': 1}, Object\\_4: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 29, 'end\\_index': 29,'size': 1}\n* Output: test case output dimension: [1, 32]; transformed objects: Object\\_1: {'color': 3,'start\\_index': 1, 'end\\_index': 15,'size': 15}\n\nWe observe that the single object included in the output corresponds to the object with the largest size in the original input; therefore, we can assume that the transformation was applied according to the rules. However, a minor discrepancy exists in the output presentation, where instead of providing the entire output array filled with zeros except for the relevant segment, only the resulting object is displayed. This difference results in less explicit verification but does not impact the conclusion about applying the correct transformation rules.\n\nAs a JSON response:\n{\n\"test\\_output\\_analysis\": \"Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input appears to have been correctly transformed into the test output.\",\n\"value\": 9\n}\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.
