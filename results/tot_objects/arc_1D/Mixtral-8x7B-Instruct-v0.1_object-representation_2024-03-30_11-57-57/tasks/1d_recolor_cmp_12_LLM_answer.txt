#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}


overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color when they are neither the first nor last object made up solely of one color. They will change to the next available color (2) if another object with a higher color value exists; otherwise, they stay as color 1.
overall pattern: For each object, check whether it is the first or last object made up solely of one color. If it does not meet these criteria, increment its color by 1 if another object with a higher color value already exists; otherwise, keep it as color 1.

 Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "Example_1": {
    "conditions_analysis": "The given conditions seem to accurately describe the input and are relevant to determining the object changes. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the conditions and the overall pattern, as the conditions mention checking if an object is the 'first' or 'last' object of a certain color, whereas the overall pattern omits this detail.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern mostly describes the transformation from input to output, but it lacks clarity on how to handle cases where no other object with a higher color value exists. It also fails to explain what happens when multiple objects of the same color exist consecutively.",

  "Example_2": {
    "conditions_analysis": "Similar to Example_1, the given conditions are applicable and relevant to the input. But again, they do not align perfectly with the overall pattern since the latter does not explicitly account for the 'first' or 'last' object.",
    "overall_pattern_analysis": "The overall pattern adequately captures the transformation from input to output for this specific example. However, similar concerns about ambiguity in handling cases without other objects of higher color value persist.",

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: For every example, when an object s starting index is greater than or equal to 5, its color will change to 2. This also implies that smaller indices (less than 5) wont experience a color change.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, iterate over each object and check its starting index. If the index is larger than or equal to 5, then change its color to 2; otherwise, leave it unchanged. Note that no movement, scaling, or removal occurs in these examples.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: When an object consists of consecutive pixels of color 1, except for single-pixel objects, there appears to be a rule that targets these objects to be recolored to color 2. This pattern could potentially apply to any input with objects meeting these conditions.
overall pattern: For every object in the input, check if it satisfies the targeting condition mentioned above. If yes, then recolor it to color 2; otherwise, leave it unchanged (maintaining the original color, position, and size).

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

overall pattern:
conditions: For every example, when an object s starting index is greater than or equal to 5, its color will change to 2. This also implies that smaller indices (less than 5) wont experience a color change.
overall pattern: To transform any input into its output, iterate over each object and check its starting index. If the index is larger than or equal to 5, then change its color to 2; otherwise, leave it unchanged. Note that no movement, scaling, or removal occurs in these examples.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: When an object consists of consecutive pixels of color 1, except for single-pixel objects, there appears to be a rule that targets these objects to be recolored to color 2. This pattern could potentially apply to any input with objects meeting these conditions.
overall pattern: For every object in the input, check if it satisfies the targeting condition mentioned above. If yes, then recolor it to color 2; otherwise, leave it unchanged (maintaining the original color, position, and size).


transformation steps: [{'step': 'Iterate through each object in the input', 'details': 'For every object present in the input data, execute the subsequent actions.'}, {'step': 'Check if the object meets the targeting criteria', 'details': 'Determine whether the current object matches the specified condition by examining its properties like color, continuity, and size.'}, {'condition': "If an object's color is 1, and its size is more than 1", 'then': 'Recolor the object to 2 while preserving its position and size', 'details': 'If the color attribute of the current object has a value equal to 1, and its size attribute is greater than 1, change its color to 2 without modifying the start_index, end_index, or size attributes.'}, {'condition': 'Otherwise', 'then': 'Do not modify the object', 'details': "In case the object doesn't meet the prescribed condition, maintain its existing information including color, start_index, end_index, and size without making any changes."}]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 2}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 4}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}

overall pattern:
conditions: When an object consists of consecutive pixels of color 1, except for single-pixel objects, there appears to be a rule that targets these objects to be recolored to color 2. This pattern could potentially apply to any input with objects meeting these conditions.
overall pattern: For every object in the input, check if it satisfies the targeting condition mentioned above. If yes, then recolor it to color 2; otherwise, leave it unchanged (maintaining the original color, position, and size).


transformation steps: [{'step': 'Iterate through each object in the input', 'details': 'For every object present in the input data, execute the subsequent actions.'}, {'step': 'Check if the object meets the targeting criteria', 'details': 'Determine whether the current object matches the specified condition by examining its properties like color, continuity, and size.'}, {'condition': "If an object's color is 1, and its size is more than 1", 'then': 'Recolor the object to 2 while preserving its position and size', 'details': 'If the color attribute of the current object has a value equal to 1, and its size attribute is greater than 1, change its color to 2 without modifying the start_index, end_index, or size attributes.'}, {'condition': 'Otherwise', 'then': 'Do not modify the object', 'details': "In case the object doesn't meet the prescribed condition, maintain its existing information including color, start_index, end_index, and size without making any changes."}]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 17], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 17]
transformed objects: [{'color : 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, {'color': 2, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 5}]
