#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}

output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: From analyzing the given examples, we observe the following rule: If an object consists of a single pixel (ignoring cases where it is adjacent to another same-colored object), it will expand to occupy the next two pixels of the same color. This implies that there must be enough available space after the object to allow this growth.
overall pattern: For each object, check if it meets the specified condition. If so, extend the object by two pixels of the same color while ensuring there is enough space to accommodate this extension.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions.

conditions: From analyzing the given examples, we observe the following rule: If an object consists of a single pixel (ignoring cases where it is adjacent to another same-colored object), it will expand to occupy the next two pixels of the same color.

overall pattern: For each object, check if it meets the specified condition. If so, extend the object by two pixels of the same color while ensuring there is enough space to accommodate this extension.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

overall pattern:
conditions: From analyzing the given examples, we observe the following rule: If an object consists of a single pixel (ignoring cases where it is adjacent to another same-colored object), it will expand to occupy the next two pixels of the same color.

overall pattern: For each object, check if it meets the specified condition. If so, extend the object by two pixels of the same color while ensuring there is enough space to accommodate this extension.


transformation steps: [{'step': '1', 'description': 'Iterate through each object in the input sequence.'}, {'step': '2', 'description': "Check if the object's size is equal to 1."}, {'step': '3', 'description': 'If true, verify if there exist at least two identical colored pixels immediately after the object.'}, {'step': '4', 'description': 'If true, extend the object by including these two identical colored pixels in its range.'}, {'step': '5', 'description': "Update the object's properties such as start_index, end_index, and size accordingly."}, {'step': '6', 'description': 'Repeat steps 1-5 for all objects in the input sequence.'}]

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the input description, the input contains one object with color 7, starting at index 2, ending at index 4, and having a size of 3. There is also a second object with color 7, starting at index 8, ending at index 8, and having a size of 1.

To apply the transformation steps, first iterate through each object. Check if the object's size is equal to 1. In this case, the second object has a size of 1. Then, verify if there exist at least two identical colored pixels immediately after the object. Since there are no more objects or pixels with color 7 after the second object, this step cannot be applied. Therefore, the final transformed objects for the test output are:

Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, here's the evaluation of the test output:

1. The first object in the test output, `Object_1`, remains unchanged. Its color is 7, which matches other objects, and its starting index is 2, which is not a multiple of three plus one. Therefore, it does not meet the condition for shifting.

2. The second object in the test output, `Object_2`, has been shifted two indices to the left compared to the input. Its color is 7, which matches other objects, and its starting index is 6, which is a multiple of three plus one. Therefore, it meets the condition for shifting.

Given that the transformation was applied correctly to the second object in the test input, the test output can be considered correct. However, since the question asks for a rating between 0 and 10, we would rate it a 9 because while the transformation was mostly correct, there was no validation of the dimensions of the input and output in the given test case. It is important to ensure that the dimensions match between the input and output sequences in order to confirm that the transformation was applied correctly.

Therefore, the output would be:
```json
{
  "test_output_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
  "value": 9
}

For the first object, its color is 7, which matches other objects' color, and its starting index is 2, which is not a multiple of three plus one. Therefore, no adjustment is required for the first object. Next, for the second object, its color is also 7, which matches other objects' color, and its starting index is 8, which is a multiple of three plus one (8 % 3 + 1 = 2). As per the conditions, we need to shift this object two indices to the left. In the provided test output, the'start\_index' of the second object is indeed 6, indicating a successful application of the transformation. Hence, based on this analysis, the test output seems to follow the correct transformation.",

 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output provided:

Input: Dimension: [1, 33], Object\_1: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 2, 'end\_index': 4,'size': 3}, Object\_2: {'color': 7,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 8,'size': 1}

Upon examining the test output, we can see that the first object, with color 7, originally started at index 2 and had a size of 3. After applying the transformation rule, we observe that the first object now starts at index 0. This indicates that the object was successfully moved two indices to the left since 2 - 2 = 0, which satisfies the transformation rule.

However, there seems to be no change in the second object with color 7, which initially started at index 8 and remained unchanged after the transformation. To verify compliance with the transformation pattern, the second object should also have been shifted two indices to the left because its starting index (8) is divisible by three (3 * 2 + 1 = 7), and it shares the same color as the first object.

Since the second object wasn't adjusted according to the rules, the test output cannot be considered correct. Therefore, I would provide the following JSON response:

{
"test\_output\_analysis": "Consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.",
"value": 5
}

I gave the value a score of 5 instead of a lower number due to the first object being properly processed based on the transformation rule.

Therefore, Object\_1 does not meet the specified condition and no change is made. Next, consider Object\_2. Its color is also 7, matching other objects, and its starting index is 8, which is a multiple of three plus one. Thus, Object\_2 meets the condition and should be shifted two indices to the left. Comparing the test output, Object\_2 indeed starts at index 8, meaning it wasn't shifted. Based on this analysis, the transformation was not applied correctly.",

Analysis:
1. Iterating through each object in the input sequence: Pass
   - Two objects found in both input and output sequences.
2. Check if the object's size is equal to 1: Pass
   - First object has size 3, second object has size 1.
3. Verify if there exist at least two identical colored pixels immediately after the object: Fail
   - Second object does not meet this condition.
   
However, even though the test fails step 3, the transformation process still extended the second object because extending based on the previous object's color is part of the overall pattern. Given that no further errors were identified, the value would be high but not perfect due to the failure in verifying step 3 during the transformation process.
