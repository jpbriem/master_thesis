#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: In general, objects tend to change position and increase size when they have at least one other object of the same color to their right. The first object of each group does not seem to move nor change size.
overall pattern: An algorithm would iterate through the input objects from left to right. If an object has another object of the same color to its immediate right, it will move two indices to the left and increase its size by 2 units. Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, it can be observed that the position of an object, specifically Object_2, may depend on some rule involving the proximity to or number of adjacent objects. Further investigation would help define more accurate conditions determining the position changes.
overall pattern: To derive a general rule for transforming an input into an output, we need to examine how the size of objects relates to their positioning. In addition, studying the relationship between multiple objects could contribute to defining better conditions for changes in their properties.

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, various conditions apply leading to changes in objects:

1. When a noise pixel exists beside the end index of an object, the object increases its end index and size.
2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.

For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input into its output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input into its output, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Through analyzing all three examples, we can identify the following main conditions that drive the transformation:  Objects of the same color tend to align their start and end indices to distribute themselves evenly throughout the sequence.
 Objects of the same color aim to have similar sizes. When possible, they merge with neighboring noise pixels to reach the desired size.
 Objects cannot merge with other objects containing noise pixels inside them.
overall pattern: To apply these rules to a given input, follow these steps:  Identify all objects in the input.
 Sort objects by color.
 Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.
 Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.
 Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, various conditions apply leading to changes in objects:

1. When a noise pixel exists beside the end index of an object, the object increases its end index and size.
2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.

#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers', 'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_3:

output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Through analyzing all three examples, we can identify the following main conditions that drive the transformation:  Objects of the same color tend to align their start and end indices to distribute themselves evenly throughout the sequence.
 Objects of the same color aim to have similar sizes. When possible, they merge with neighboring noise pixels to reach the desired size.
 Objects cannot merge with other objects containing noise pixels inside them.
overall pattern: To apply these rules to a given input, follow these steps:  Identify all objects in the input.
 Sort objects by color.
 Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.
 Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.
 Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.

------
 Based on the given input, here's the description of the objects present in the input:
{'input_description': 'There are four objects with color 4 in the input. Object 1 has a size of 3 and covers the indices from 1 to 3. Object 2, 3, and 4 have a size of 1 and cover index 8 for Object 2, index 12 for Object 3, and index 18 for Object 4 respectively.'}

Applying the provided transformation steps yields the following result:
{'transformation': 'First, the objects are identified and sorted by color, resulting in four objects of color 4 being considered. Then, the spacing between adjacent objects of the same color is analyzed and adjusted to achieve a uniform distribution across the sequence. Next, the size of each object is examined and compared against other objects of the same color. Finally, smaller objects are merged with neighboring noise pixels if they don't conflict with previous merging rules. This results in Object 2 growing to size 3 (indices 7-9), Object 3 remaining unchanged at size 1 (index 12), and a new Object 5 forming out of Object 4 and some neighboring noise pixels, having a size of 3 (indices 17-19).'}

Based on this analysis, the output would be structured as follows:

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, various conditions apply leading to changes in objects:

1. When a noise pixel exists beside the end index of an object, the object increases its end index and size.
2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.

[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence.

------
 Based on the given examples, overall pattern, transformation steps, and test case, let's evaluate the test output:

First, let's compare the input and output dimensions, which both are [1, 32]. This part is correct.

Now, let's look at the objects and their properties:

Original Input Objects:
1. Color: 4; Start Index: 1; End Index: 3; Size: 3
2. Color: 4; Start Index: 8; End Index: 8; Size: 1
3. Color: 4; Start Index: 12; End Index: 12; Size: 1
4. Color: 4; Start Index: 18; End Index: 18; Size: 1

Transformed Output Objects:
1. Color: 4; Start Index: 1; End Index: 3; Size: 3
2. Color: 4; Start Index: 6; End Index: 8; Size: 3 (Adjusted)
3. Color: 4; Start Index: 11; End Index: 13; Size: 3 (Adjusted)
4. Color: 4; Start Index: 17; End Index: 19; Size: 3 (Adjusted)

We notice that the objects sharing the same color have their start and end indices adjusted to distribute them more evenly throughout the sequence. Also, the sizes of the objects remain constant (except for Object_2, Object_3, and Object_4, whose sizes increased due to merging with neighboring noise pixels). All these changes comply with the overall pattern provided. Therefore, it seems like the transformation follows the given instructions accurately.

However, there is still one missing piece of information – what is the required object size? Without this detail, it is impossible to fully determine if the merged objects meet the criteria specified in the last transformation step. If we assume the required object size is 3, then the test output has been applied correctly based on the information available. Nonetheless, additional context about the required object size would make the evaluation more precise.

As a result, my response would be:
{
  "test\_output\_analysis": "Considering each step of the transformation instructions, the test input appears to be correctly transformed into its output. However, without full knowledge of the required object size, I cannot definitively confirm compliance with the final transformation step.",
  "value": "8"

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input according to the given transformation steps and overall pattern.

First, let's go through each of the transformation steps:

1. **Identify all objects in the input.** - Passed. In the test output, all objects were identified correctly.
2. **Sort objects by color.** - Not applicable since there is only one color (4) present in this example.
3. **Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.**
   * Before: [1, 3], [8, 8], [12, 12], [18, 18]
   * After: [1, 6], [8, 8], [12, 12], [18, 18] - Failed. Only the first object has been expanded. Other objects did not change their indices.
4. **Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.**
   * Before: [3], [1], [1], [1]
   * After: [5], [1], [1], [1] - Partially passed. Although the size of the first object changed, it's still expected to be adjusted to match the size of other objects of the same color.
5. **Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.** - Not applicable in this case since there are no other noise pixels around objects to merge.

Now, based on the above analysis, although some aspects of the transformation were followed, there are discrepancies compared to the expected overall pattern and specific transformation steps. Thus, I would rate the test output as follows:

{'test_output_analysis': 'Considering the transformation instructions, the test input was not completely transformed into the expected output. Step 3 was only partially applied, while step 4 showed changes but might still need further refinement depending on the expected final result.', 'value': '5'}
------
 Based on the given problem statement, let's evaluate the test output by considering each transformation step.

1. **Identify all objects in the input.**
   - It seems that the test output has identified four objects of color 4. This is consistent with the input.

2. **Sort objects by color.**
   - Since there is only one color present in both the input and the output, this condition does not need to be checked.

3. **Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.**
   - In the test output, the first object now extends from index 1 to 6 (inclusive), covering the positions initially occupied by the second and third objects in the input. While it ensures an even distribution, it may not necessarily be correct since merging two or more objects of the same color might not always result in combining their indices linearly.

4. **Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.**
   - According to the test output, there is one remaining object after the first object has been extended. However, no information about the location or size of this object has been provided. Therefore, it's impossible to say for sure if all the objects match in terms of their size.

5. **Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.**
   - As mentioned before, while the first object has merged the second and third objects from the original input, it remains unclear if these merges were valid based on the constraints presented in step 3.

Since some important details regarding the final outcome are missing, I would rate the test output as 5 out of 10 due to ambiguity. If complete and accurate information had been available for all affected objects, then further assessment could lead to a higher rating.

overall pattern:
conditions: Through analyzing all three examples, we can identify the following main conditions that drive the transformation:  Objects of the same color tend to align their start and end indices to distribute themselves evenly throughout the sequence.
 Objects of the same color aim to have similar sizes. When possible, they merge with neighboring noise pixels to reach the desired size.
 Objects cannot merge with other objects containing noise pixels inside them.
overall pattern: To apply these rules to a given input, follow these steps:  Identify all objects in the input.
 Sort objects by color.
 Analyze the space between each pair of adjacent objects of the same color and adjust their start and end indices accordingly to ensure a uniform distribution along the sequence.
 Examine the size of each object and check whether it matches the size of other objects of the same color.
 Merge smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels until they reach the required size if doing so does not violate step 3.

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the input-output patterns provided, the transformation appears to involve adjusting the start and end indices of objects of the same color to create a more uniform distribution across the input sequence, while also attempting to make the sizes of those objects more consistent. However, without a specific proposed output for the test case, it's impossible to evaluate whether the transformation has been applied correctly.

Therefore, I am unable to provide a numerical rating for the test output, as there is no test output to evaluate. If a specific proposed output were provided, I would be happy to reevaluate based on that information.
------
 Based on the provided information, the transformation steps appear to involve identifying objects in the input sequence, sorting them by color, adjusting the spacing between objects of the same color, checking object sizes, and merging smaller objects with neighboring noise pixels if possible. However, there is no test output provided for the given test input. Therefore, I am unable to evaluate and analyze the application of the transformation to the test input.

To provide an analysis and rating for the test output, I would need the actual test output generated by applying the transformation to the test input. Once I have that information, I can assess how well the transformation was applied and provide a rating based on that assessment. For now, without the test output, I cannot proceed with the evaluation and analysis.#############################

#############################
Value Outputs:
 Based on the provided information, let's evaluate the test output:

Input:
Dimension: [1, 32], Object\_1: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 1, 'end\_index': 3,'size': 3}, Object\_2: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 8, 'end\_index': 8,'size': 1}, Object\_3: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 12, 'end\_index': 12,'size': 1}, Object\_4: {'color': 4,'start\_index': 18, 'end\_index': 18,'size': 1}

Output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32],
transformed objects: Object 1: {color: 4, start\_index: 1, end\_index: 5, size: 5}, Object 2: {color: 4, start\_index: 8, end\_index: 11, size: 4}, Object 3: {color: 4, start\_index: 12, end\_index: 13, size: 2}, Object 4: {color: 4, start\_index: 18, end\_index: 19, size: 2}

Now we will consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze whether the test input was correctly transformed into its output:

Step 1: Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input. This step seems to be a preparatory step and doesn't affect the output directly. It's assumed to be done correctly.

Step 2: Check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object (i.e., at the end\_index). Update the end\_index and size of the object by adding the number of consecutive noise pixels found.

* Object 1 has end\_index = 3 initially and finds two consecutive noise pixels (0) to its right; hence, it becomes end\_index = 5 with a size increase to 5.
* Object 2 has end\_index = 8 initially and finds three consecutive noise pixels (0) to its right; hence, it becomes end\_index = 11 with a size increase to 4.
* Object 3 has end\_index = 12 initially and finds one consecutive noise pixel (0) to its right; hence, it becomes end\_index = 13 with a size increase to 2.
* Object 4 has end\_index = 18 initially and does not find any consecutive noise pixels (0) to its right; therefore, it remains unchanged with end\_index = 18 and a size of 1.

This step appears to be executed accurately according to the rules described.

Step 3: Make relevant adjustments to the updated end\_index and size based on factors such as the starting index, possible interactions with nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances. While this description is somewhat vague and lacks specificity, comparing the example outputs suggests that no further modifications were required beyond Step 2. Since the current test output matches expected results derived from applying Steps 1 & 2, it implies that Step 3 may not even be necessary when following those guidelines.

Given the above analysis, our judgment is as follows:

{"test\_output\_analysis": "The test output appears to be correct after analyzing each step of the transformation instructions.", "value": "10"}

 {
  'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation instructions, let us analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output:\n\nStep 1: Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input - This step seems to have been followed correctly.\nStep 2: For each object, check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object (i.e., at the end\_index). Update the end\_index and size of the object by adding the number of consecutive noise pixels found. - This step appears to have been executed mostly correctly, but there might be some inconsistencies in updating the end\_index and size for certain objects. For instance, Object 3 has an end\_index of 13 instead of 12, which could be due to misinterpretation of the pattern.\nStep 3: Make relevant adjustments to the updated end\_index and size based on factors like the starting index, possible interactions with nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances - It is unclear whether this step has been implemented accurately since there is no clear rule provided for making these adjustments, and the results seem somewhat arbitrary. There also does not appear to be any consideration given to the starting index or interactions with nearby objects.',

Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 3}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}

overall pattern:
conditions: Based on these examples, various conditions apply leading to changes in objects:

1. When a noise pixel exists beside the end index of an object, the object increases its end index and size.
2. Changes in end index and size appear to follow consistent patterns, likely related to the object s relative position and neighboring elements.
overall pattern: Generalize a pattern to transform inputs into outputs based on the given examples:

1. Detect the presence of noise pixels adjacent to any existing object.
2. If one or more noise pixels are detected, update the corresponding object(s) end index and size accordingly.
3. Apply relevant adjustments based on the observed conditions from the examples, i.e., the end index and size increments of objects follow a pattern linked to their starting index, possible involvement of nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.


transformation steps: [{'step': '1', 'description': 'Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input.'}, {'step': '2', 'description': 'For each object, check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object (i.e., at the end_index). Update the end_index and size of the object by adding the number of consecutive noise pixels found.'}, {'step': '3', 'description': 'Based on the observed patterns from the examples, make relevant adjustments to the updated end_index and size based on factors like the starting index, possible interactions with nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances.'}]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}
output:
test case output dimension: [1, 32]
transformed objects: Object_1: {color: 4, start_index: 1, end_index: 6, size: 6}, Object_2: {color: 4, start_index: 8, end_index: 9, size: 2}, Object_3: {color: 4, start_index: 12, end_index: 13, size: 2}, Object_4: {color: 4, start_index : 18, end_index: 19, size: 2}

 {
  'test\_output\_analysis': 'Considering each step of the transformation instructions, let us analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output:\n\
Step 1: Initialize variables and iterate through each object in the input - Completed successfully.\n\
Step 2: Check if there is a noise pixel adjacent to the right side of the object and update the end\_index and size - This step has been completed, but it seems that when updating the end\_index and size, some additional noise pixels were included (\[4, 5\] and \[13, 14\]). However, this does not seem to align with the provided examples where only direct neighbors are considered.\n\
Step 3: Make relevant adjustments based on factors like the starting index, possible interactions with nearby objects, and inter-pixel distances - It appears that no further adjustments have been made after Step 2.\n\
In conclusion, while most of the transformation process followed the instructions, there seems to be an issue with including extra noise pixels during the update, which did not occur in the given examples.',
  
  'value': '6' # Since there are issues with incorporating extra noise pixels, we cannot rate the test output highly despite other parts being correct. Therefore, we would assign a moderate score of 6 out of 10.
