#############################Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'regarding the first example, analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'regarding the first example, describe the differences between the input and output objects, be precise and say WHAT changed HOW, focus on color, position, size', 'conditions': 'regarding the first example, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the input that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'regarding all examples, why do certain objects change? Search for conditions in the inputs that determine the changes, focus on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 12}

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 12}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}


overall pattern:
conditions: Across all examples, the primary condition governing object changes revolves around their position. It appears that the objects undergo a rightward shift determined by their starting index and size. The shifts do not affect the objects’ colors or sizes, though their endpoint indices get adjusted accordingly.
overall pattern: To generate the output from an input: 
1. Examine each object in the input.
2. Analyze the object s starting index and size.
3. Shift the object to the right by a quantity equal to `ceiling(starting_index / size)`.
4. Keep the object s color and size unaltered during the shift.

1. Examine each object in the input.
2. Analyze the object s starting index and size.
3. Shift the object to the right by a quantity equal to `ceiling(starting_index / size)`.
4. Keep the object s color and size unaltered during the shift.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.

Evaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input into its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 12}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all instances, the determining factor for relocating an object lies within the starting index of the object. When the starting index is adjusted by adding a constant value (typically +3), the ending index mirrors the increase proportionally, so the size of the object remains unaltered.
overall pattern: To apply the pattern to any given input, seek out the object(s), note their starting index, add a fixed value (e.g., +3) to that index, then modify the ending index accordingly, ensuring the invariant object size throughout the process. This results in moving the entire object along the 1D canvas.



transformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify the object(s) present in the input sequence.', 'Step 2: Note the starting index of each identified object.', 'Step 3: Add a fixed value (+3 in this case) to the noted starting indices of each object.', 'Step 4: Calculate the new ending index for each object by maintaining the original size of the object.', 'Step 5: Update the start_index and end_index fields of each object with the newly calculated values.', 'Step 6: Keep the rest of the input sequence unchanged.']

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:

In summary, while most of the steps were followed correctly, the shifting step did not take place according to the instructions. This resulted in the original object remaining unchanged instead of being shifted based on the specified rule.

 Based on the input-output pairs and the provided overall pattern, it can be observed that the objects in the input sequence undergo a rightward shift based on their starting index and size. This shift results in adjustment of the endpoint indices without affecting the objects' colors or sizes.

Applying this pattern to the given test case, we first examine the object's properties:

* Color: 1
* Starting Index: 0
* Ending Index: 6
* Size: 7

To evaluate the correctness of the test output, we will perform the transformation using the given steps and then compare the result to the test output.

Step 1: Examine each object in the input. [Done]
Step 2: Analyze the object's starting index and size. [Starting index: 0, Size: 7]
Step 3: Calculate the shifting quantity = ceil(starting\_index/size) = ceil(0/7) = 0
Step 4: Perform the shift -> New Start Index: 0 + 0 = 0, New End Index: 0 + 7 - 1 = 6

After applying the transformation to the test case input, we obtain:

Transformed Test Case Output:
Dimension: [1, 16]
Transformed Objects: Object\_1: {color: 1, start\_index: 0, end\_index: 6, size: 7}

Comparing our transformed test case output to the given test output, we find them identical. Therefore, the transformation has been applied correctly to the test input according to the given rules.

Value Outputs:
 Based on the given information, let's evaluate the test output.

First, we examine each transformation step and then analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.

Step 1: Examine each object in the input.
The test output matches this step since it includes the single object present in the input.

Step 2: Analyze the object's starting index and size.
The test output matches this step as well, with the correct starting index (0) and size (7) specified for the object.

However, there is an issue with Step 3, where the object should be shifted according to the rule defined earlier. Let's calculate the adjustment needed:
`ceiling(starting_index / size) = ceiling(0 / 7) = 0`
This means that no shift should occur for this object based on the described pattern.

But in the test output, the object remains at the original indices. Therefore, we must determine whether this deviation is intentional due to some nuance not captured in the provided description or simply incorrect. Considering the provided information, the assumption would be that it is incorrect.

Overall, while Steps 1 and 2 were followed accurately, Step 3 wasn't, resulting in the test output being likely incorrect. Thus, we cannot provide a high rating.

{'test_output_analysis': 'In the test output, while the first two transformation steps seem to have been followed correctly, the third step, which involves shifting the object based on a formula using the starting index and size, was not executed properly. This results in the test output likely being incorrect.', 'value': '2'}
------
 Based on the provided information, we will evaluate the given test output.

First, let's go through the transformation instructions:

1. Examine each object in the input.
2. Analyze the object's starting index and size.
3. Shift the object to the right by a quantity equal to `ceiling(starting_index / size)`.
4. Keep the object's color and size unaltered during the shift.

Now, let's apply these instructions to the test input:

* Input: Dimension: [1, 16], Object\_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 0, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 7}

We can see that the `start_index` is 0, so there is no need to shift the object according to instruction 3. Therefore, the correct output should be:

* Output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object\_1: {'color': 1,'start\_index': 0, 'end\_index': 6,'size': 7}

However, the provided test output does not appear to follow the instructions since it didn't shift the object. We should rate this transformation as incorrect:

{
'test\_output\_analysis': 'Consider each step of the transformation instructions. In the first step, examine the given input and compare it against the expected result. Notice that the object did not undergo any shift, while the instructions clearly indicated shifting the object based on the starting index and size.

Value Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 7}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 7}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 6}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 6}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 16], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 12}
output: Dimension: [1, 16], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}

overall pattern:
conditions: Across all instances, the determining factor for relocating an object lies within the starting index of the object. When the starting index is adjusted by adding a constant value (typically +3), the ending index mirrors the increase proportionally, so the size of the object remains unaltered.
overall pattern: To apply the pattern to any given input, seek out the object(s), note their starting index, add a fixed value (e.g., +3) to that index, then modify the ending index accordingly, ensuring the invariant object size throughout the process. This results in moving the entire object along the 1D canvas.

------
 Based on the given transformation pattern and steps, let's evaluate the test output:

First, we identify the object present in the input sequence:
Object_1: {color: 1, start\_index: 0, end\_index: 6, size: 7}

Next, we note the starting index of the identified object:
start\_index = 0

Then, we add the fixed value (+3) to the noted starting index:
new\_start\_index = start\_index + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3

Now, we calculate the new ending index for the object while keeping the size unchanged:
new\_end\_index = new\_start\_index + size - 1 = 3 + 7 - 1 = 9

Finally, we update the start\_index and end\_index fields of the object:
transformed object: Object_1: {color: 1, start\_index: 3, end\_index: 9, size: 7}

Given the test input and the provided transformation pattern and steps, it appears that the transformation has been applied correctly to the test input. Therefore, I would rate the test output as a 10.
