In this case, there is only one object (Object\\_1).\n* We then calculate the desired shift as one third of the object size, rounded down. Here, the size of Object\\_1 is 16, so the desired shift would be 5 (rounded down from 5.33).\n* Next, we update the object's start index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (less than the sequence length - object size). After adding 5 to the start index of 6, we get 11. This value is still within the valid range of the input sequence, since 11 < 29 - 16 = 13.\n* Finally, we update the object's end index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (greater than or equal to 0). After adding 5 to the end index of 21, we get 26. However, this value is not within the valid range of the input sequence, since 26 > 29. To correct this, we set the end index to be equal to the updated start index plus the size of the object minus 1. So, the end index is set to 11 + 16 - 1 = 26 - 2 = 24.\n\nTherefore, after applying the transformation steps, the test output will have the following objects:\n\n* Object\\_1: {'color': 2,'start\\_index': 11, 'end\\_index': 24,'size': 16}\n\nAnd the final output will be:\n\n{\n'input\\_description': 'Objects in the input include one object (Object\\_1) with color 2, starting at index 6 and ending at index 21, giving it a total size of 16.',\n'transformation': 'After applying the transformation steps, Object\\_1 has moved to the right by 5 units, resulting in a new start index of 11 and a new end index of 24.

It starts at index 6 and ends at index 21, making its size 16.\n\nFollowing the overall pattern and the transformation steps, we perform the required operations on the input object.\n\n* Transformation: Iterating through each object, we first calculate the desired shift as one third of the object size rounded down. Here, 16 / 3 = 5.33, so we take 5 as our shift value. We then add the shift value to both the start and end indices of the object while ensuring they remain within the valid range. So, the new start index becomes `min(sequence_length - object_size, current_start_index + shift)` (which is min(29-16, 6+5)=11)), and the new end index becomes `max(0, current_end_index + shift)` (which is max(0, 21+5)=26).

So, 16/3 = 5 (rounded down). Then, we update the start index of the object by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (i.e., less than the sequence length - object size). In this case, the updated start index would be 6 + 5 = 11. Similarly, we update the end index by adding the calculated shift, ensuring it remains within the valid range (i.e., greater than or equal to 0). In this case, the updated end index would be 21 + 5 = 26.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input into its output.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
