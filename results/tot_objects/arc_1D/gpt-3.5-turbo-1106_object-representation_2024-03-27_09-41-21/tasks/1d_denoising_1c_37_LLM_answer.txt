You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

Value Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for an object to be present in the output seems to be that it must have the same color, start_index, end_index, and size as the corresponding input object.
overall pattern: The overall pattern is that only the objects with the same color, start_index, end_index, and size as the corresponding input object are included in the output. Other objects are removed.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object in the input sequence, check if there is a corresponding object in the output sequence with the same color, start_index, end_index, and size.', 'If there is a corresponding object in the output sequence, keep it. If not, remove the object from the output sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 14}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}, Object_6: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 31, 'end_index': 31, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 12}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 26, 'end_index': 26, 'size': 1}
output: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 14}

overall pattern:
conditions: The condition for an object to be present in the output seems to be that it must have the same color, start_index, end_index, and size as the corresponding input object.
overall pattern: The overall pattern is that only the objects with the same color, start_index, end_index, and size as the corresponding input object are included in the output. Other objects are removed.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'For each object in the input sequence, check if there is a corresponding object in the output sequence with the same color, start_index, end_index, and size.', 'If there is a corresponding object in the output sequence, keep it. If not, remove the object from the output sequence.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}
output:
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 13}
test case output dimension: [1, 33]
