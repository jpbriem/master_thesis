You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.


Imagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': "based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change? Search for conditions in the input based on object colors, positions, and sizes!', 'overall_pattern': 'define general rules to transform any input into its output based only on the input. Specify WHAT type of object changes, WHY it changes, and HOW. Be specific!'}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Evaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color from 5 to 8 based on a specific condition that is related to their position or size in the input sequence.
overall pattern: When the color of an object in the input is 5, the color of the corresponding object in the output changes to 8, while the position and size remain the same. This transformation seems to be based on the condition of the object's color being 5 in the input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.

Your task is to give detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to all examples to transform the input sequence into its output sequence.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'conditions': 'list all relevant conditions regarding the input that determine the transformation', 'transformation_steps': 'create a list of detailed transformation steps that are generally applicable to transform a given input sequence into its output sequence, focus on conditions. Be specific!'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color from 5 to 8 in the output. The change seems to be based on the color of the object in the input, with no other conditions affecting the transformation.
overall pattern: If an object's color is 5 in the input, then in the output, its color becomes 8 while the position and size remain unchanged. This transformation applies to all objects with color 5 in the input.

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.

The transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:
- Objects: 
	- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.
	- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.
- Noise pixels.
- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.
- Conditions: rules might be conditional.
This list is not exhaustive.

Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.

Moreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.
You are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 4}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 4}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 20, 'size': 4}, Object_5: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 22, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 4}

Example_2:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}
output: Dimension: [1, 26], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 7}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 11, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 5}

Example_3:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 5}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 2}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 4}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 17, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 5}, Object_5: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 24, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 2}

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color from 5 to 8 in the output. The change seems to be based on the color of the object in the input, with no other conditions affecting the transformation.
overall pattern: If an object's color is 5 in the input, then in the output, its color becomes 8 while the position and size remain unchanged. This transformation applies to all objects with color 5 in the input.


transformation steps: ["For each object in the input sequence, if the object's color is 5, then change its color to 8 in the output while keeping the position and size unchanged."]


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 5}

transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with color 5 in the input sequence.', 'Recolor each identified object with color 5 to 8, maintaining their positions and sizes.', 'Check if there are any cases where a new object with color 8 needs to be introduced in the same position and with the same size as the original color 5 object in the input.', 'If necessary, add new objects with color 8 based on the positions and sizes of the original color 5 objects in the input.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 5}

You are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.


Moreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.
Moreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.
Moreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.

Evaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!
You are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects change color from 5 to 8 in the output. The change seems to be based on the color of the object in the input, with no other conditions affecting the transformation.
overall pattern: If an object's color is 5 in the input, then in the output, its color becomes 8 while the position and size remain unchanged. This transformation applies to all objects with color 5 in the input.


transformation steps: ["For each object in the input sequence, if the object's color is 5, then change its color to 8 in the output while keeping the position and size unchanged."]

overall pattern:
conditions: Objects with color 5 are transformed into objects with color 8 while maintaining their positions and sizes.
overall pattern: Objects with color 5 are recolored to 8 without changing their position and size. Additionally, in some cases, a new object with color 8 is introduced in the same position and with the same size as the original color 5 object in the input.


transformation steps: ['Identify all objects with color 5 in the input sequence.', 'Recolor each identified object with color 5 to 8, maintaining their positions and sizes.', 'Check if there are any cases where a new object with color 8 needs to be introduced in the same position and with the same size as the original color 5 object in the input.', 'If necessary, add new objects with color 8 based on the positions and sizes of the original color 5 objects in the input.']


Test case:
input: Dimension: [1, 26], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 5}
output:
transformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 5}, Object_3: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 2}, Object_4: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 5}
