The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input.

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 7, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 14, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 10, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 12, 'end_index': 12, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}, Object_3: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 3}, Object_4: {'color': 5, 'start_index': 15, 'end_index': 17, 'size': 3}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The objects' color, size, and relative positions in the input directly determine the color, size, and relative positions of the corresponding objects in the output. The transformation follows a consistent pattern based on the input objects' attributes.\noverall pattern: The transformation pattern maintains the color, size, and relative positions of the input objects to determine the color, size, and relative positions of the output objects. The start and end indices of the output objects are shifted by -1 compared to the input. Objects of the same color and size are transformed in a consistent manner across the input-output pairs.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['1. For each object in the input sequence, identify its color, start index, end index, and size.', '2.
