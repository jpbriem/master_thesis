Copy the identified object as is to form the output sequence, disregarding the presence of other objects or their properties.\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate#############################\nNext node, get values:\n#############################\n###########################################################\nValue Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 1-dimensional input sequence of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output sequence. The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 18, 'end_index': 18, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 28, 'end_index': 28, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 14, 'size': 12}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}, Object_4: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 29, 'end_index': 29, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 14}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 22, 'size': 15}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The objects change based on the condition that the output object is a subset of the input objects with the same color. The size and position of the output object are determined by the corresponding input object.\noverall pattern: The general rule is that the output object's color, position, and size are derived from the input by selecting the object with the same color and retaining its properties. In cases where the number of objects changes, the output object becomes a subset of the input objects and inherits their color, position, and size.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the input object with the same color as the output object.', 'Retain the color, start_index, end_index, and size of the identified input object to determine the properties of the output object.', 'If the number of input objects with the same color is greater than the number of output objects, the output object becomes a subset of the input objects and inherits their color, position, and size.', 'If the number of input objects with the same color is less than the number of output objects, only the properties of the corresponding input object are retained for the output object.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.

The size and position of the output object are determined by the corresponding input object.\noverall pattern: The general rule is that the output object's color, position, and size are derived from the input by selecting the object with the same color and retaining its properties. In cases where the number of objects changes, the output object becomes a subset of the input objects and inherits their color, position, and size.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the input object with the same color as the output object.', 'Retain the color, start_index, end_index, and size of the identified input object to determine the properties of the output object.', 'If the number of input objects with the same color is greater than the number of output objects, the output object becomes a subset of the input objects and inherits their color, position, and size.', 'If the number of input objects with the same color is less than the number of output objects, only the properties of the corresponding input object are retained for the output object.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 32], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 19, 'end_index': 19, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 23, 'end_index': 23, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 27, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 1}, Object_5: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 30, 'end_index': 30, 'size': 1}\noutput:\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 15, 'size': 13}\ntest case output dimension: [1, 32]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 0\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 8\n}"
