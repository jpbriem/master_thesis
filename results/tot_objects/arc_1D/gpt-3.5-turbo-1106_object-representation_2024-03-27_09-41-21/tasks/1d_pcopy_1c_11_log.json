The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\n\nEvaluate the given pattern and analyze if it correctly describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'conditions_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.', 'overall_pattern_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.', 'precision_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 6, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 7, 'size': 3}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 8, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 4, 'size': 3}, Object_2: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 7, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 3}\n\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The transformation rule seems to involve shifting Object_2 by 1 unit to the left in the output compared to the input. This rule applies to objects with any color and size.\noverall pattern: The overall transformation rule states that Object_2 in the output is always shifted one position to the left compared to the input, regardless of the color and size of the object. This shift could be a general pattern applied to all objects in the sequence.\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"Regarding the first example, analyze if the given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output.\",\n    \"value\": \"Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the given hints and pattern as integer.\"\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n------\n{\n  \"Example_1\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes, as they describe the specific transformation rule applied to Object_2.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output by specifying the consistent shift of Object_2 by 1 unit to the left.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides a clear and consistent rule for the transformation of Object_2.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_2\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes, as they describe the specific transformation rule applied to Object_2.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output by specifying the consistent shift of Object_2 by 1 unit to the left.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides a clear and consistent rule for the transformation of Object_2.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  },\n  \"Example_3\": {\n    \"conditions_analysis\": \"The given conditions refer only to the input and are relevant to determine the object changes, as they describe the specific transformation rule applied to Object_2.\",\n    \"overall_pattern_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern describes the transformation from input to output by specifying the consistent shift of Object_2 by 1 unit to the left.\",\n    \"precision_analysis\": \"The given overall pattern is precise enough to transform a new input to its output, as it provides a clear and consistent rule for the transformation of Object_2.\",\n    \"value\": 9\n  }\n}"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}.
