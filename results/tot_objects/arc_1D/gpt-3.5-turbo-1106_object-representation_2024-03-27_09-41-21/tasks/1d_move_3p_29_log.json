The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nImagine you want to explain how to transform a new input without knowing its output yet. Your task is to infer the overall pattern that describes the relation between all input-output pairs.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'Example_1': {'object_number': 'analyze if and how the number of objects changed from input to output', 'object_analysis': 'make an in-depth analysis and compare the input and output objects, focus on color, position, size', 'object_relations': 'can you identify relationships between objects from the input that became objects from the output?', 'object_transformation': \"based on the input, how can we determine the output object's color, position, and size? Focus on conditions explaining the transformation\"}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': {'conditions': 'why do objects change?

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\nMoreover, you are given a test input and a potential test output.\n\nEvaluate the given test output and analyze if the transformation was applied correctly to the test input. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'test_output_analysis': 'consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the test output as integer.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n#####\nuser:\n#####\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 5}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 2, 'start_index': 4, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 5}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 6}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 4, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 8, 'size': 6}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 8, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The objects in the input are transformed by shifting their start_index by 3 positions to the right to obtain the corresponding output objects.\noverall pattern: The consistent transformation rule is to shift the start_index of the objects in the input by 3 positions to the right to obtain the corresponding output objects. This transformation applies to objects of any color and size, maintaining their color and size unchanged.\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Step 1: Identify all objects in the input sequence.', 'Step 2: For each object, shift its start_index by 3 positions to the right to obtain the start_index of the corresponding output object.', 'Step 3: Create the output sequence with the transformed objects using the updated start_index and keeping the color and size unchanged.']\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 10], Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 0, 'end_index': 3, 'size': 4}\noutput:\ntransformed objects: Object_1: {'color': 6, 'start_index': 3, 'end_index': 6, 'size': 4}\ntest case output dimension: [1, 10]\n\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}\n------\n{\n  \"test_output_analysis\": \"consider each step of the transformation instructions and analyze if the test input was correctly transformed into its test output.\",\n  \"value\": 10\n}"
