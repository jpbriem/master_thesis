For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nEvaluate the given transformation steps and analyze if they correctly describe the transformation for all examples. Be as critical as possible with all details!\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'Example_1': {'transformation_analysis': 'Regarding the first example, analyze if the transformation steps correctly transform the input sequence into its output sequence.', 'value': 'Based on your analysis regarding the first example, give a rating between 0 and 10 for the transformation steps as integer.'}, 'Example_2': {Ellipsis}}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 16, 'end_index': 16, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 21, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 1, 'end_index': 13, 'size': 13}\n\nExample_2:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 1, 'start_index': 13, 'end_index': 27, 'size': 15}\n\nExample_3:\ninput: Dimension: [1, 33], Objects: Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 2, 'end_index': 2, 'size': 1}, Object_2: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 5, 'end_index': 5, 'size': 1}, Object_3: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 9, 'end_index': 9, 'size': 1}, Object_4: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}, Object_5: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 25, 'end_index': 25, 'size': 1}\noutput: Dimension: [1, 33], Object_1: {'color': 3, 'start_index': 11, 'end_index': 21, 'size': 11}\n\noverall pattern:\nconditions: The objects change based on the specific position and size of certain objects in the input. The change involves the removal of some objects and the preservation of others, potentially based on their position and size.\noverall pattern: The transformation involves the removal of certain objects and the preservation of others, potentially based on their position and size. The preserved objects seem to maintain their position and size in the output.\n\n\n\ntransformation steps: ['Identify the objects in the input sequence.', 'Determine the specific position and size of each object.', 'Based on the overall pattern, remove certain objects from the input sequence while preserving others. The decision to remove or preserve an object may depend on its position and size.', 'For the preserved objects, ensure that they maintain their position and size in the output sequence.']\n#############################\nValue Outputs:\nNo Valuation - Only one candidate"

The input and output sequences have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. Adjacent pixels of the same color are designated as objects. For example [0, 2, 2, 0, 3] represents a pixel sequence of dimension [1, 5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: 2, start_index: 1, end_index: 2, size: 2}, Object_2: {color: 3, start_index: 4, end_index: 4, size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the position.\n\nThe transformation from input to output follows a certain pattern with logical rules that might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Objects: \n\t- transformations, such as move, hollow, scale, remove, copy, recolor.\n\t- relations between objects, such as distance, alignment, overlap, containment.\n- Noise pixels.\n- Arithmetics based on objects: Counting, sorting.\n- Conditions: rules might be conditional.\nThis list is not exhaustive.\n\nMoreover, you are given an overall pattern that describes the relation between the inputs and outputs of all examples.\nMoreover, you are given a list of detailed transformation steps that transform an input sequence into its output sequence.\n\nMoreover, you are given a new test case with a new input. Your task is to transform the test input into its test output.\nYou are to output only the following in json format, fill the values as described: {'input_description': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects in the input sequence, focusing on size, position, color.', 'transformation': 'apply the transformation steps and describe in natural language how the objects should look like in the test output, focusing on size, position, color', 'output': {'transformed_objects': 'Describe the transformed objects for the test output by following the format in the test case input.', 'test_case_output_dimension': 'state the dimension of the test case output [rows, columns] as list of integers'}}.
