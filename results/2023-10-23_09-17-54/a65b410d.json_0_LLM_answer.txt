\end{code}  The first line of the file contains the number of training examples, and the second line contains the number of testing examples. Each subsequent line represents a single input/output pair, with the input separated from the output by a tab character.

The task is to write a program that can read this file and learn from it to be able to predict the output for a given input. Your program will be tested on a set of test cases that are not included in the training data.

Write a program that reads the training data from the standard input, learns from it, and then uses this knowledge to predict the output for a given input. The input and output should be represented as strings of characters (e.g., "a", "b", "c", etc.). You may use any programming language you like, but keep in mind that the input/output pairs will be processed sequentially, one at a time. In other words, your program should be able to process each input/output pair independently without having access to future inputs or outputs.

Note that the training data contains only six different symbols ("a" through "f") and the empty string (""). It's up to you to decide how to represent these symbols in your program. For example, you could use numerical codes (e.g., "a" corresponds to 0, "b" corresponds to 1, etc.), or you could use arbitrary symbols that you define yourself. As long as your program can correctly predict the output for a given input using the training data, it does not matter how you choose to represent the symbols.
