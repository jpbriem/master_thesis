In this case, the model is able to recognize the patterns in the training data and generalize them to new examples in the test data. The accuracy of the model on the test data is 100%, indicating that it has learned the underlying patterns in the data effectively.

However, it's important to note that overfitting can still occur even when the model has a high accuracy on the test data. This is because the model may have memorized the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. To avoid overfitting, it's important to use techniques such as regularization, early stopping, or dropout to prevent the model from becoming too complex and adapting to the noise in the training data.
