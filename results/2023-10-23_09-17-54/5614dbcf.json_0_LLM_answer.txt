In this task, you are given a set of input-output pairs, where the inputs are sequences of characters and the outputs are corresponding labels. Your goal is to learn a model that can predict the label for a given input sequence.

The first line of the input file contains the number of training examples, followed by the training input-output pairs. Each training input-output pair consists of a input sequence and a corresponding label, separated by a space. The second line contains the number of test examples, followed by the test input-output pairs.

For example, in the first training example, the input sequence is "d d d d a a a" and the corresponding label is "d". In the second training example, the input sequence is "a a a a h f h" and the corresponding label is "a".

Your job is to learn a model that can predict the label for a given input sequence. You can use any machine learning algorithm or technique you like, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, etc.

Once you have trained your model, you can use it to predict the labels for the test input sequences. Note that the test input sequences are not provided in advance, so you will need to use your model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

You can submit your solution in any format you like, such as a Python script, a Jupyter notebook, or a plain text file. We will evaluate your solution using our evaluation metric, which is based on the accuracy of your predictions on the test set.

Good luck!
