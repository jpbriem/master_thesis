I'm trying to use the `fit` method from scikit-learn library to train this model but I get an error message saying that "the feature matrix is not 2D".

Here is my code so far:
```
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Load data
train_input = pd.read_csv('train.txt')
test_input = pd.read_csv('test.txt')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train_input['input'], train_input['output'], test_size=0.3)

# Create vectorizer object
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit vectorizer to training data
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Train Naive Bayes classifier on training data
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Print accuracy score
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
Can someone please help me understand what the issue is and how to resolve it? Thank you!

The error message says that the feature matrix is not 2D, but when I check the shape of the matrix using `print(X_train.shape)` it gives (144, 10), which looks like a 2D array to me. Can someone please clarify what's going on here?

Answer: The issue is likely that the `TfidfVectorizer` expects a 2D array as input, where each row represents a document and each column represents a word in the vocabulary. However, your `X_train` and `X_test` arrays have a shape of `(144, 10)`, which means they are 1D arrays with 144 elements, and each element is a 10-dimensional vector representing a bag-of-words representation of a single document.

To fix this, you can reshape your data to be 2D by using the `reshape` method:
```
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 10)
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 10)
```
This will convert your 1D arrays into 2D matrices, where each row represents a document and each column represents a word in the vocabulary.

Alternatively, you can also use the `numpy.array` function to create a 2D array directly from your 1D arrays:
```
X_train = np.array(X_train).reshape(-1, 10)
X_test = np.array(X_test).reshape(-1, 10)
```
Either way should work, and you should then be able to use the `fit_transform` method without any issues.
