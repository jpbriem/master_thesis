The first line of the file contains the number of examples (4) and the number of items (5). Each example is represented as a sequence of 5 binary vectors, where each vector corresponds to an item and has a 1 in the position of the item that is present in the bag-of-words representation of the text. For instance, the first example can be read as follows:

* The first bag-of-words representation contains the items "d" and "a". It is represented by the binary vector [1, 1, 0, 0, 0].
* The second bag-of-words representation contains the items "d", "a", and "c". It is represented by the binary vector [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].
* The third bag-of-words representation contains the items "b", "a", and "c". It is represented by the binary vector [0, 1, 1, 0, 0].

The last line of the file contains the test input, which consists of 3 bag-of-words representations. Your task is to predict the missing items in these representations using the patterns learned from the training data.
