The first line contains the number of training examples n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains a training input, which is a sequence of k integers (1 ≤ k ≤ 5) separated by spaces. The integers are in the range [1, m], where m is the number of distinct symbols in the vocabulary. Each integer represents a symbol in the vocabulary. The last line of the training data contains the corresponding output for that input.
The next line contains the number of test examples m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100). Each of the next m lines contains a test input, which is a sequence of k integers (1 ≤ k ≤ 5) separated by spaces. The integers are in the range [1, m]. Your task is to predict the corresponding output for each test input.
Your program should produce one line of output for each test input, containing the predicted output for that input. If your program cannot generate an output for a particular input, it should produce an empty line instead.
Note: In this problem, we use the term "vocabulary" to refer to the set of all distinct symbols used in the training and test inputs. The size of the vocabulary is m.
