The first line contains the number of training examples n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains a training input and output pair, separated by a space. The training input is a sequence of distinct uppercase letters (A–Z) representing the tokens in the input sentence, and the training output is a sequence of distinct uppercase letters representing the tokens in the output sentence. Each letter in the input and output sequences corresponds to a unique token.
The last line contains the number of test examples m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100). Each of the next m lines contains a test input and output pair, separated by a space. The format of the test inputs and outputs is the same as that of the training inputs and outputs.
Your task is to learn a mapping from input sentences to output sentences using the given training data, and then use this mapping to generate the correct output for each test input.
Output
For each test input, output the corresponding test output.
Constraints
Time limit: 3 seconds
Memory limit: 256 megabytes
Note
In this problem, we use a simplified version of the English language modeling task, where the input and output sentences are sequences of tokens (words or punctuation symbols). Your goal is to learn a mapping from input sentences to output sentences based on the given training data. This problem is similar to various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and chatbots.
Hint
You can solve this problem using a variety of techniques, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and rule-based systems. Here are some hints to get you started:
1. Statistical models: You can represent the probability distribution over the tokens in the input and output sentences using a matrix. You can then use various techniques, such as matrix multiplication, to compute the probability distribution over the output tokens given the input tokens.
2. Machine learning algorithms: You can use various machine learning algorithms, such as supervised learning or reinforcement learning, to learn a mapping from input sentences to output sentences. You can represent the input and output sentences as vectors of features, and use a neural network or other machine learning models to learn the mapping.
3. Rule-based systems: You can represent the mapping from input sentences to output sentences using a set of rules. For example, you can define a set of production rules, where each rule specifies a condition and an action. The condition is a pattern over the input tokens, and the action is a sequence of output tokens. You can then use these rules to generate the output sentence given the input sentence.
4. Hybrid approaches: You can combine multiple techniques above to create a hybrid approach. For example, you can use both statistical models and machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of your model.
Sample dataset
Here's a sample dataset for this problem:
Training data:
Input: a, b, c
Output: a, b, c, a
Input: b, c, d
Output: b, c, d, b
Input: a, d, e
Output: a, d, e, a
Input: c, b, e
Output: c, b, e, c
...
Test data:
Input: c, i
Output:?
Input: b, e
Output:?
Input: d, e
Output:?
Input: a, c
Output:?
...
In this example, the training data consists of four input-output pairs, where each input is a sequence of three distinct uppercase letters, and each output is a sequence of four distinct uppercase letters. The test data consists of four input-output pairs, where each input is a sequence of two distinct uppercase letters, and each output is a sequence of three distinct uppercase letters. Your task is to learn a mapping from input sentences to output sentences using the training data, and then use this mapping to generate the correct output for each test input.
