End of example.
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each containing a single string of characters (no spaces), representing the input for that test case. The last line contains a single integer N, the length of the shortest sequence that can be formed using all the characters in the input strings exactly once.
Your task is to determine the correct output for each test case. For each test case, you should output a single line containing a string of characters (no spaces) representing the output for that test case. If there are multiple possible outputs, you should output the one that comes first lexicographically.
Constraints:

* T = 100
* Each character in the input and output strings is a letter ('a'..'z') or a digit ('0'..'9').
* Each input string has length at most 20.
* Each output string has length at most 20.
* There are no spaces in the input or output strings.
Example:

Input:
4
aaabbbcccc
aaaaaaabbbb
bbbbcccdddd
ccccccccaaa

Output:
aaabbbcccc
aaaaaaabbbb
bbbbcccdddd
ccccccccaaa

Explanation:
The first test case has input "aaabbbcccc". The longest common prefix of all characters in this string is "a", which appears three times. Therefore, the output for this test case is "aaabbbcccc".

The second test case has input "aaaaaaabbbb". The longest common prefix of all characters in this string is "a", which appears six times. Therefore, the output for this test case is "aaaaaaabbbb".

The third test case has input "bbbbcccdddd". The longest common prefix of all characters in this string is "b", which appears four times. Therefore, the output for this test case is "bbbbcccdddd".

The fourth test case has input "ccccccccaaa". The longest common prefix of all characters in this string is "c", which appears five times. Therefore, the output for this test case is "ccccccccaaa".

Note that the output for each test case is the original input string, since none of the characters appear more than once in the input.
