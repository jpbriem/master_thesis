LLM answer:

?
End of test.
```

In this task, you are given a set of examples with input and output pairs, where the inputs are 3-element vectors of binary digits (0 or 1) and the outputs are single binary digits. Your goal is to learn a mapping from input vectors to output vectors that generalizes well to new, unseen examples.

The first line of the input file contains the number of training examples, which is followed by the training examples themselves, each consisting of a triplet of binary digits (separated by spaces) representing the input vector, followed by a single binary digit representing the output vector. The last line of the input file contains the number of test examples, which is followed by the test examples in the same format as the training examples.

Your job is to predict the missing output for the test examples. Note that there may be multiple possible correct answers for some test examples, but you should output only one solution per test example.
