The first line of the file contains the number of examples and the number of features (3) for each example. The following lines contain the input data for each example, separated by spaces, followed by the corresponding output data, also separated by spaces.

For example, in the first example, the input is `b b a` and the output is `b b a`. In the second example, the input is `b b b` and the output is `b b b`. In the third example, the input is `a a a` and the output is `a a a`.

Your task is to write a program that can learn from this data and predict the correct output given a new set of input data. You can use any machine learning algorithm or model you like, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.

Please submit your solution in the form of a Python script that takes in a list of input data and outputs the predicted labels. For example, if the input data is `[['b', 'b', 'a']]`, the output should be `['b']`. If the input data is `[['a', 'a', 'a']]`, the output should be `['a']`.

Note that the input data will always have 3 elements, and the output data will always have 1 element. Also, note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this problem, and the evaluation metric used to measure performance may vary depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
