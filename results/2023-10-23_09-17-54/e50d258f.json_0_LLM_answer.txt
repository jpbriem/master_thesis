LLM answer:

?
\end{code}

This is an IPython notebook that contains several examples of RNNs being used for sequence prediction tasks. The first cell in the notebook provides an explanation of what the notebook covers and what the reader should know before proceeding.
The second cell presents an example of training an RNN on a synthetic dataset with 5 inputs, 5 outputs, and a sequence length of 5. The input and output data are provided as numpy arrays, and the cell explains how to preprocess the data and create a dataset class for this task.
The third cell shows how to define a simple RNN architecture using Keras, including the input and output layers, embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense layer. It also demonstrates how to compile the model with a loss function and an optimizer.
The fourth cell shows how to train the model on the synthetic dataset using the `fit` method, and how to evaluate its performance using the `evaluate` method.
The fifth cell presents another example of training an RNN on a different synthetic dataset with 10 inputs, 5 outputs, and a sequence length of 3. This time, the input and output data are provided as text files, and the cell explains how to read in the data and preprocess it.
The sixth cell defines a more complex RNN architecture that uses two LSTM layers and an additional dense layer. It also demonstrates how to use the `model.summary()` method to print a summary of the model's architecture.
The seventh cell trains the model on the second synthetic dataset and evaluates its performance.
The eighth cell presents a third example of training an RNN on yet another synthetic dataset with 5 inputs, 5 outputs, and a sequence length of 5. This time, the input data consists of five binary features represented as integers (0 or 1) and the output is a single integer value.
The ninth cell defines a custom dataset class `SyntheticData` that inherits from `Sequential API` and implements the `create_dataset` method to generate batches of data for training and testing.
The tenth cell uses the `SyntheticData` class to generate a large dataset with 20000 samples and split it into training and test sets.
The eleventh cell trains an RNN model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the test set.
The twelfth cell presents a final example of using an RNN to perform sequence prediction on a real-world dataset consisting of stock price data. It loads the data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and splits it into training and test sets.
The thirteenth cell defines an RNN architecture similar to the one used in the previous examples, but with a few modifications to accommodate the specifics of the stock price dataset.
The fourteenth cell trains the model on the training set and evaluates its performance on the test set.
The final cell asks the reader to try modifying the model architecture and hyperparameters to see if they can improve the performance of the model.
