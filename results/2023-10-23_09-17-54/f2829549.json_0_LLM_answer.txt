The first line contains the number of training examples, followed by the training input and output pairs. The last line contains the number of test examples, followed by the test input and expected output pairs.

In this case, we have 4 training examples and 1 test example. Each training example consists of 6 input features (represented by letters) and 1 output feature (represented by either 'a' or 'd'). The test example also has 6 input features and 1 output feature.

Your task is to develop a decision boundary that can accurately classify the output for the given input features. You can use any algorithm or model you like, but you must justify your choice and explain how it works.

Please provide your answer in the form of a report, including the following sections:

1. Introduction - Briefly introduce the problem and its significance.
2. Literature Review - Discuss relevant algorithms and models that can be used for classification tasks, their strengths and weaknesses, and examples of applications.
3. Methodology - Describe the algorithm or model you chose and why, along with any preprocessing steps or assumptions made.
4. Results - Present the results of your classification model on the test data, including accuracy metrics and visualizations.
5. Conclusion - Summarize your findings, discuss the limitations of your approach, and suggest potential improvements or future work.

Note: Please ensure that your report is well-structured, easy to follow, and includes proper citations and references where appropriate.
