The first line contains the number of training examples, followed by the training examples themselves, and then the number of test examples, followed by the test examples. Each example consists of a sequence of tokens (either 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd') separated by spaces, and is represented as a single string. The goal is to learn a mapping from input sequences to output sequences that generalizes well to new, unseen examples.
In this case, the training data seems to consist of two types of examples:
1. Examples with only 'a's and 'd's, where the output is always a sequence of 'd's followed by a single 'a'.
2. Examples with a mix of 'a', 'b', and 'c's, where the output is always a sequence of 'a's and 'c's.
There are no examples that contain both 'a's and 'd's, or 'b's and 'c's.
The test data also contains a mix of these two types of examples.
This is an artificial dataset, created for the purpose of illustrating a simple machine learning problem. It is not intended to represent any real-world task or application.
