The first line of the file contains the number of examples (4) and the number of features (7). Each example is represented by 7 binary values separated by spaces, and each value corresponds to a feature. For instance, the first example has the features "g" (1st), "g" (2nd), "g" (3rd), "f" (4th), "a" (5th), "f" (6th), and "a" (7th). The last line of the file contains the expected outputs for the test inputs.

Your task is to predict the missing outputs for the test inputs based on the given training data. You can use any machine learning algorithm or model you like, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.

Please submit your predictions in the format specified in the file, with the predicted outputs separated by spaces and corresponding to the test inputs in the order they appear in the file.
