The first line of the file contains the number of examples and the number of tests that follow. Each example consists of three lines: the first line contains the input (three characters), the second line contains the output (three characters), and the third line is blank. The last line of each example is followed by the word "End of example.". Similarly, the test section has three lines for input and three lines for output.

I want to read this file and create a neural network that can predict the output given an input. I have tried using the `pandas` library to read the file but it doesn't seem to work well with this format. Is there another way to read this file in Python?

Answer: You can use the `csv` module to read this file, even though it's not a CSV file in the classical sense. You can specify the delimiter and quotechar to handle the unusual format of the file. Here's an example:
```
import csv

with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=' ', quotechar='"')
    examples = list(reader)

# print(examples)
# [['c', 'c', 'c'], ['d', 'c', 'd'], ['d', 'd', 'd'],...]

# Create a neural network...
```
This will give you a list of lists, where each sublist represents a single example, and each element in the sublist corresponds to a character in the input or output.

You can then use this data to train your neural network using a library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
