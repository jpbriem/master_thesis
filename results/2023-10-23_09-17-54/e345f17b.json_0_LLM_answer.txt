The task is to determine the next symbol in each sequence, given the previous symbols. The first four examples are training cases, and the last one is a test case. Your goal is to learn a model that can predict the correct output for the test case.

To solve this problem, you need to figure out what kind of pattern or rule is underlying the given sequences. Look at the training cases carefully and try to find a way to generate the output symbols from the input symbols. Once you have a hypothesis, you can use it to predict the output for the test case.

Note that this is a somewhat simplified version of a real-world problem. In practice, the number of symbols and the length of the sequences would be much larger, and the problem would be more challenging. But the basic idea remains the same: you need to learn a model that can generalize from the training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.
