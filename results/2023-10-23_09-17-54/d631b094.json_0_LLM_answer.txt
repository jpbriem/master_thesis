Note that the training data is in the format of pairs of input and output, where each input is a sequence of three characters (a, b, or c) and each output is a single character (a, b, or c). The test data is also in this format.
The goal of this problem is to learn a mapping from input sequences to output characters using the given training data, and then use this mapping to predict the output for the given test data.
In this case, it's not hard to notice that there are 26 possible inputs (3^3 = 27, but one of them is the empty string), and 3 possible outputs for each input. So, the first thing we can do is to represent each input as a number between 0 and 25, where the number corresponds to the position of the input in the list of all possible inputs. For example, the first input "a, a, a" would be represented as 0, since it's the first possible input. The second input "b, a, a" would be represented as 1, since it's the second possible input, and so on.
Then, we can create a matrix with dimensions (26, 3) where each row represents an input and each column represents a character in the input. We can fill this matrix with 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates the presence of a particular character in a particular position. For example, the first row of the matrix would have a 1 in the first column, since the first input has an 'a' in the first position. The second row would have a 1 in the second
