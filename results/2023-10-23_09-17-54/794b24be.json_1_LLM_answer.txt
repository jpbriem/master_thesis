LLM answer:

?,?,?
End of test.
\end{code}

The `train` section contains several examples of input-output pairs that the model should learn from. Each example is represented as a list of three elements: the input (three integers), the output (three integers). The last element of each example is the end of the example.

The `test` section contains a single example of input-output pairs that the model should predict on.

Your task is to write a program that can solve this problem. You can use any programming language and any machine learning library or framework you prefer. Your program should take the input data and output the predicted labels for the test input.

Please note that this is a simplified version of a real-world problem, and the solution may not be trivial. Also, please keep in mind that the performance of your model may vary depending on the specific implementation and the complexity of the problem.
