a, g, c, g, c, g, a, g

\end{code}

The first line of the training data contains the input and output for the first example. The second line contains the input and output for the second example, and so on. The last line contains the test input and output.

In this case, we have four examples in the training data, and one example in the test data. Each example consists of an input sequence (represented by a string of characters) and an output sequence (also represented by a string of characters).

The task is to learn a mapping from input sequences to output sequences, based on the given training data, and then use this mapping to predict the output sequence for the test input.

For example, the first input sequence is "a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a", and the corresponding output sequence is "a, a, a, d, a, a, a, a". The second input sequence is "a, e, a, a, a, e, a, a", and the corresponding output sequence is "a, e, c, c, c, e, a, a". And so on.

Your goal is to develop a program that can learn the mapping from input sequences to output sequences, based on the given training data, and then use this mapping to predict the output sequence for the test input. You can use any machine learning algorithm or technique you like, as long as your program produces the correct output for the test input.
