The first line contains the number of examples (4) and the number of items (5). Each item is represented by a unique letter (a-e). The next four lines contain the training data, with each line representing one example. Each example consists of three items, separated by commas. For instance, the first example has items 'g', 'f', and 'f'. The last line contains the test data, which consists of three items 'b', 'c', and 'f'.

Your task is to determine the rule that generates the output for a given input. You can assume that the rule is a simple mapping from inputs to outputs, and it should be applicable to all instances in the training data. Once you have discovered the rule, use it to predict the output for the test data.

Hint: Try to find a simple mapping that can explain all instances in the training data. Look for patterns or relationships between the items.
