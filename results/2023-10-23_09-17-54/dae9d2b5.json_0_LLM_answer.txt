The task is to determine the next three characters in the output sequence for each row of the test input. The first row has already been partially filled with the correct answers (','and '?' are placeholders for missing values). Your job is to fill in the remaining blanks.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions for some rows, but we're looking for a single answer for each row. Also, please do not modify the given input or output; only provide your answers in the format specified below.

Format for submitting answers:
For each row of the test input, please submit three characters separated by spaces. For example, if you think the first row should have the output 'g g a', then you would submit 'g g a' (without quotes) as your answer for that row. If you leave a row blank, it will be interpreted as a guess of '?' for all three characters.

You can submit your answers in the comment section below. Good luck!
