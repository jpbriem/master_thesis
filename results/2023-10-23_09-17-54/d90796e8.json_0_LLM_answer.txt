End of examples.

The first line contains the number of training examples n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Each training example is represented as two lines, the input and the corresponding output. The input is a sequence of characters 'a', 'c', 'd', or 'f' (representing the four possible symbols) separated by spaces, and the output is either 'i' (if the input symbol is the same as the previous one) or a character representing the next symbol in the sequence.

The last line contains the number of test examples m (1 ≤ m ≤ 20). Each test example is represented as a single line containing a sequence of characters 'a', 'c', 'd', or 'f' separated by spaces.

Your task is to write a program that can generate the correct output for the given input sequences. You can assume that the input and output sequences will always be valid (i.e., they will only contain the four specified symbols, and the length of the input sequence will be the same as the length of the output sequence).

Note that this problem is similar to a finite automaton recognition problem, where you need to recognize the language generated by the given grammar.
