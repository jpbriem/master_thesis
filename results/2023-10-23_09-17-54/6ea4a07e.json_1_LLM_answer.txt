The first line of the file contains the number of training examples, which is 6 in this case. Each training example consists of three lines, where each line represents a sequence of three characters (the input). The corresponding output for each input is given on the following line.

The last line of the file contains the number of test examples, which is 1 in this case. The test input and output are given in the same format as the training data.

Your task is to predict the missing values in the test output.
