The first line of the file contains the number of examples and the number of tests that follow. Each example consists of 4 inputs (separated by spaces) and 4 outputs (also separated by spaces). The last line of the file contains the number of tests, which are also in the same format as the examples.

I'm trying to use the `keras.preprocessing.sequence` module to load this data into memory so I can train an LSTM model on it, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to specify the correct input and output formats. Here's what I have tried so far:
```
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing import sequence

# Load the data from the file
data = np.loadtxt('data.txt', dtype=int, skiprows=1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[:80], data[80:], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the input and output formats for the sequence data
input_format = sequence. pad_sequences(maxlen=4)
output_format = sequence. pad_sequences(maxlen=4)

# Convert the data to sequences
X_train_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=4)
y_train_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(y_train, maxlen=4)
X_test_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=4)
y_test_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(y_test, maxlen=4)

# Create the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(4, 1)))
model.add(Dense(4, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train_seq, y_train_seq, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_seq, y_test_seq))
```
This code throws an error because the input and output formats don't match. Can someone please help me figure out how to correctly specify the input and output formats for this data using the `keras.preprocessing.sequence` module?

Answer: It looks like you're almost there! The issue is that you're using `pad_sequences` twice, which isn't necessary. Instead, you should use `pad_sequences` only once, and then split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing import sequence
from sklearn.utils import train_test_split

# Load the data from the file
data = np.loadtxt('data.txt', dtype=int, skiprows=1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the input and output formats for the sequence data
input_format = sequence.pad_sequences(maxlen=4)
output_format = sequence.pad_sequences(maxlen=4)

# Convert the data to sequences
X_train_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=4, padding='post', truncating='post')
y_train_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(y_train, maxlen=4, padding='post', truncating='post')
X_test_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=4, padding='post', truncating='post')
y_test_seq = sequence.pad_sequences(y_test, maxlen=4, padding='post', truncating='post')

# Create the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(4, 1)))
model.add(
