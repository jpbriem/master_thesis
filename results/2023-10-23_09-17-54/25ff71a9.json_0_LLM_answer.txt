In this example, we have a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing 3 neurons, and the task is to learn a mapping from input vectors to output vectors. The training data consists of 4 examples, each specified as a pair of input and output vectors. The first three examples are used to train the network, and the fourth example is used for testing.

The network takes in 3 inputs (a, b, a), (b, b, b), (a, a, a) and outputs 3 corresponding outputs (a, a, a), (b, b, b), (a, a, a).

The training process involves adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between neurons in order to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. This process is repeated multiple times until the performance on the test set plateaus or reaches a desired level.

It's worth noting that this is a very basic example and in real-world scenarios, the datasets are much larger and more complex, and the networks are designed to handle a large number of inputs, outputs and layers, and different architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) and Autoencoders.
