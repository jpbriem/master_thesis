The idea is to learn the rules for each letter in the input string and then use those rules to predict the next letter in the sequence. The training data provides examples of input strings and their corresponding output strings, which are used to train the model. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new input strings.
In this case, the task is to generate the next letter in the sequence given the previous letters. The model should be able to capture the patterns and relationships between the letters in the input string and generate the correct output string.
For example, if the input string is "a, a, d", the model should be able to recognize that the pattern "a, a" is followed by "d" and generate the output string "a, a, d, a". Similarly, if the input string is "a, e, j", the model should be able to recognize that the pattern "a, e" is followed by "j" and generate the output string "a, e, j, a".
The goal is to maximize the accuracy of the predictions made by the model. This means that the model should be able to correctly generate the next letter in the sequence given the previous letters as input. The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
