Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (1)

You are using a different model for each set of data. The first two models are trained on the first two sets of data, and then used to predict the test set. The third model is trained on the entire dataset, including the test set.

If you want to use the same model for all three sets of data, you need to train it on the entire dataset, including the test set. Then you can use this single model to make predictions on all three sets of data.
