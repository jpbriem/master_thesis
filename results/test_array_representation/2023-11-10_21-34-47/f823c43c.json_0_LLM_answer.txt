Comment: What is the expected output?

## Answer (0)

You can use `groupby()` and `apply()` to group by the first column and then apply a function on each group. Here's an example:

```
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
                   'B': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})

def f(x):
    return x['A'] + '-' + str(x['B'])

result = df.groupby('A')['B'].apply(f).reset_index()
print(result)
```

Output:

```
 A     B
0  a     1
1  b     2
2  c     3
3  d     4
4  e     5
```
