Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict a value for an input that is different from any of the inputs in your training set, then you need to use cross-validation.

## Answer (4)

You can use `predict_proba()` instead of `predict()`. This will return the probabilities of each class. You can then take the max probability and convert it back to the original label.

Here is some sample code:

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

iris = load_iris()
X = iris['data']
y = iris['target']

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
clf.fit(X, y)

# test on first 5 samples
print(clf.predict_proba([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]))

# take max probability and convert back to label
print(clf.predict([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]])[0]) # should be 2
```
