Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict on new data that is different from the training data, then you need a model that can generalize. You could try using a neural network with more layers and/or neurons per layer.

## Answer (0)

You are trying to fit a linear regression model to non-linear data. This will never work.

If you have a dataset where each feature has a linear relationship with the target variable, then you should use linear regression. Otherwise, you should use a neural network or other non-linear model.
