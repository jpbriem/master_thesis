Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (2)

You are using a different model for each set of data. The first model is trained on `[[4, 4, 8], [6, 4, 3], [6, 3, 0]]`, the second model is trained on `[[6, 8, 9], [1, 8, 1], [9, 4, 9]]`, and the third model is trained on `[[4, 6, 9], [6, 4, 1], [8, 8, 6]]`.

If you want to use the same model for all sets of data, you need to train it once on all of them together.

Here is an example of how you could do this:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Define the X and y arrays for all sets of data
X = [[[4, 4, 8], [6, 4, 3], [6, 3, 0]],
     [[6, 8, 9], [1, 8, 1], [9, 4, 9]],
     [[4, 6, 9], [6, 4, 1], [8, 8, 6]]]
y = [[[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]],
      [[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]],
      [[6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6]]]

# Train the logistic regression model on all sets of data
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(np.vstack(X), np.hstack(y))

# Test the model on the test set
test_input = [[8, 8, 6], [4, 6, 9], [8, 3, 0]]
test_output = clf.predict([test_input])
print(test_output)
```

Solution:
[[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]]
