Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can do that with any model. What is your question?

## Answer (2)

You are using a different model for training and testing. The first model has 3 hidden units, while the second model has 4 hidden units. This means that the two models have different weights and biases.

If you want to use the same model for training and testing, you need to initialize the weights and biases of the model in the same way before training and testing. In other words, you need to set the initial values of the weights and biases to be the same for both training and testing.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to initialize the weights and biases of the model in the same way before training and testing:

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the weights and biases of the model
weights = np.random.randn(6, 2)
biases = np.zeros(6)

# Create the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, solver='liblinear', random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

In this example, we initialized the weights and biases of the logistic regression model using NumPy's `random.randn()` function, which generates random numbers from a standard normal distribution. We then created the logistic regression model using scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` class and fit it to the training data using the `fit()` method. Finally, we made predictions on the test data using the `predict()` method of the trained model.
