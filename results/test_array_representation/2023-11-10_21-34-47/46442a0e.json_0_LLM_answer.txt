Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "I want to use the same model for both training and testing". You can use the same model but you need to split your data into training and test sets.

## Answer (0)

You should split your data into training and test set before feeding it into the model.

Here is an example of how you could do this using scikit-learn:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split your data into X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Now you can feed X_train, y_train into your model
# And X_test, y_test into your predict function
```

Solution:
[[1, 4, 1, 9, 4, 1], [4, 9, 4, 1, 9, 4], [9, 1, 9, 9, 4, 1], [1, 4, 9, 9, 1, 9], [4, 9, 1, 4, 9, 4], [1, 4, 9, 1, 4, 1]]
