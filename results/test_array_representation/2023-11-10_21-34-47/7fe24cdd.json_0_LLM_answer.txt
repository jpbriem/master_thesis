Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training data". If you want to predict on test data that is different from the training data, then you need a model that can generalize. You have provided no information about your model or how it was trained.

## Answer (1)

You are using a linear regression model which is not suitable for this problem. Linear regression models only work with continuous variables and cannot handle categorical variables.

For example, in your first dataset, `[0, 3, 0]` is a categorical variable because it has two possible values. In contrast, `[8, 5, 0]` is a continuous variable because it has an infinite number of possible values.

To solve this problem, you should use a classification algorithm such as logistic regression or decision trees. These algorithms can handle both categorical and continuous variables.
