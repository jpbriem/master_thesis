LLM answer:

\end{code}

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The neural net doesn't know anything about patterns. It just tries to minimize a loss function (e.g., sum of squared errors). If it can do that with a small number of neurons in one hidden layer then so be it. You could try adding more layers and see if that helps.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to create an ANN which will learn how to solve this problem.
\end{blockquote}

You are using a feed-forward neural network for this task. This type of model is good at learning functions. However, your problem is not a function but rather a sequence of steps. For example, when you have a `5` on the left side, you need to add two cells to the right side. But when you have a `9`, you need to add three cells to the right side. So, there is no simple function that maps inputs to outputs here. Instead, you should use recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks.
