LLM answer:

\end{code}

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first layer is the same as the second". The first layer has a different number of neurons than the second. Also, it looks like your training data is all zeros and ones? Is that correct? If so, then why are you using sigmoid activation functions in the hidden layers? You should use relu or tanh instead.

Answer: It seems to me that you have two problems here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your network architecture is wrong for this problem (see below)
\item Your learning rate is too high (see below).
\end{itemize}

I think the main issue with your network architecture is that you don't need any hidden layers at all! This is because you only have one feature per pixel, which means that each pixel can be classified independently from every other pixel. So if you want to classify an image, just run each pixel through the network separately.

If you really wanted to use a neural net for some reason, then you could try making the input layer size equal to the number of pixels in the image, but again there would be no point having any hidden layers since they wouldn't do anything useful.

The other thing I noticed was that your learning rate seemed very high - 0.5 is way too much! Try reducing it down until things start working better.
