LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0]]
\end{code}

I'm trying to create a neural network that can recognize the pattern in this data and predict the output for a given input. I've tried various architectures and hyperparameters but nothing seems to work well. Can someone help me understand what's going on here and how to approach this problem?

Answer: This is a classic example of an XOR gate, which is a simple binary logic gate that outputs 1 if the inputs are different and 0 if they are the same. The truth table for an XOR gate is as follows:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

Your training data consists of 4 input features (8, 8, 0, 0) and 1 output feature (2). However, the relationship between the input and output features is not linear, it's actually an XOR gate.

To solve this problem, you need to use a non-linear activation function such as sigmoid or ReLU in the hidden layer of your neural network. Also, you may want to add more hidden layers to your network to handle the non-linearity of the problem.

Here's an example architecture that should be able to solve this problem:

* Input Layer: 4 neurons (8, 8, 0, 0)
* Hidden Layer 1: 6 neurons with sigmoid activation function
* Hidden Layer 2: 6 neurons with sigmoid activation function
* Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation function

You may also want to try using a different optimizer such as Adam or RMSProp instead of gradient descent.

It's worth mentioning that this problem is very easy for humans to solve, but it's difficult for machines because the relationship between input and output is not straightforward.
