LLM answer:


Answer:

The pattern in the training data is that each row of the input matrix is a permutation of the elements in the corresponding row of the output matrix. In other words, the rows of the input matrix are shuffled versions of the rows of the output matrix.

Therefore, to solve the problem, we can simply rearrange the elements of the test input matrix to match the order of the corresponding row of the output matrix. Here's how it would look like for the given test input:

test input: [[4, 6, 4, 4], [4, 6, 4, 4], [7, 6, 7, 9], [9, 4, 9, 7]]

permuted test input: [[4, 4, 6, 4], [4, 4, 6, 4], [7, 9, 7, 6], [9, 7, 4, 9]]

Now, we can apply the same logic to the permuted test input and compare it with the original test input to find the missing number.

For example, in the first row of the permuted test input, we have 4-4=0, which means that the missing number in the first row of the test input is 0. Similarly, in the second row of the permuted test input, we have 4-4=0, which means that the missing number in the second row of the test input is also 0.

In the third row of the permuted test input, we have 7-6=1, which means that the missing number in the third row of the test input is 1. And so on.

So, the missing numbers in the test input are:

[0, 0, 1, 2]

Therefore, the answer is [0, 0, 1, 2].
