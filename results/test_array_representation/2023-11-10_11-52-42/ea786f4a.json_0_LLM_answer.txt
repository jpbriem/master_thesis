LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]]

Actual result:
[[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]]

As you can see, the actual result is not what I expected. It seems that the model is always predicting 6, no matter what the input is. I'm not sure why this is happening. Can someone help me troubleshoot this issue?

Here is my code for building and training the model:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load data
X =... # load train data
y =... # load train labels
X_test =... # load test data

# Split data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Scale data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
