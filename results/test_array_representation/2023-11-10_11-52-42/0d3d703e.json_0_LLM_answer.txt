LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[7, 2, 5], [7, 2, 5], [7, 2, 5]]

But the actual result is different. What's wrong?

Answer: The issue is that the model is not able to generalize well to new data because the training data is too similar. All the input arrays in the training data have the same shape (3, 1, 2) and the values are close to each other. As a result, the model has learned only the trivial solution that always outputs the same array, instead of learning a meaningful transformation between the input and output.

To fix this problem, you can try increasing the diversity of the training data by adding more variations to the input arrays, such as different shapes, scales, and distributions. You can also try using techniques like data augmentation, normalization, or feature scaling to improve the quality of the training data.
