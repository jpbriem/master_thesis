I'm trying to create a neural network that can solve this problem. I've tried various architectures and hyperparameters but nothing seems to work. Can someone please help me with this?

Answer: This is a classic example of a "partitional dependence" problem in machine learning. The issue is that the output depends only on a subset of the inputs (in this case, the last three inputs), but not on all six inputs.

To solve this problem using a neural network, you need to design an architecture that effectively ignores the first three inputs and uses only the last three inputs to make predictions. Here are some suggestions for how to do this:

1. Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a small receptive field (e.g., 3x3 kernel). The CNN will learn to extract features from the input data, and the small receptive field will ensure that it focuses only on the last three inputs.
2. Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a short sequence length (e.g., 3). The RNN will process the input data one time step at a time, and the short sequence length will ensure that it only considers the last three inputs when making predictions.
3. Use a fully connected neural network (FCN) with a carefully designed architecture. For example, you could use a FCN with two hidden layers, where the first hidden layer has a large number of neurons (e.g., 100) and the second hidden layer has a smaller number of neurons (e.g., 10). The first hidden layer would learn high-level features from the entire input, while the second hidden layer would learn low-level features only from the last three inputs.
4. Use a attention mechanism to selectively focus on the last three inputs. You could add an attention layer after the input layer, which learns a weight vector that indicates the importance of each input. Then, you could use the weighted sum of the inputs as the new input to the network.

In addition to these architectural changes, you may also want to experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. It's also important to use appropriate regularization techniques, such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting.
