LLM answer:


Please help me understand why my neural network is not working as expected. I have tried different activation functions and changing the number of hidden layers but nothing seems to work.

Answer: There are several issues with your code that could be causing it to not work as expected:

1. Data preprocessing: Your training data contains a mix of integers and floating-point numbers. It's best to convert all inputs to floats before feeding them into the neural network. You can do this by scaling the values to a common range, such as -1 to 1, or normalizing them to have zero mean and unit variance.
2. Input shape: The shape of your input data is inconsistent. Some samples have 7 elements, while others have 8. Make sure to pad or truncate the inputs to a fixed length to avoid confusion for the model.
3. Output shape: Similarly, the shape of your output data is inconsistent. Some samples have 3 elements, while others have 8. Decide on a fixed output size for your model and make sure to adjust the last layer's dimensions accordingly.
4. Activation function: While trying different activation functions is a good approach, you might want to consider using a consistent activation function throughout the model. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a popular choice for image classification tasks.
5. Hidden layers: Having too many or too few hidden layers can affect the model's performance. Try experimenting with different numbers of hidden layers and see how the model performs. A good starting point is to use two or three hidden layers with around 256 neurons each.
6. Optimizer: The optimizer you choose can impact the training process. Consider trying Adam, RMSProp, or SGD with a learning rate schedule to improve the training dynamics.
7. Regularization: Overfitting is a common issue in deep learning. To address this, add regularization terms to the loss function, such as dropout, L1, or L2 regularization. This helps prevent overly complex models from dominating the training set.
8. Training loop: Your current implementation trains the model on the entire dataset at once. Instead, try using a training loop that iterates over mini-batches of the data. This will help the model converge faster and more reliably.
9. Early stopping: Implement early stopping to stop training when the validation loss stops improving. This prevents overfitting and saves time by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
10. Model architecture: Lastly, consider modifying the model architecture to better suit the problem. For example, you could try adding convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers, or experiment with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) if the input data has a temporal aspect.

By addressing these points, you should be able to improve the performance of your neural network and achieve better results on the test set.
