LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7], [4, 4, 6]]
```

In this example, the model is trained on four input-output pairs, and then tested on a single input. The expected result is also provided.

The training data consists of input arrays with dimensions (3,) and corresponding output arrays with dimensions (3,). The inputs are vectors of three numbers each, while the outputs are also vectors of three numbers each.

For instance, the first training input is [[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]], and the corresponding output is [[1, 8, 2], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]]. This means that when the model is given the input vector [2, 2, 1], it should produce the output vector [1, 8, 2], and so on for the other two input vectors.

The test input is [[6, 4, 4], [6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7]], which the model has not seen before. The expected result is [[6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 7], [4, 4, 6]], indicating how the model should transform the test input to produce the desired output.
