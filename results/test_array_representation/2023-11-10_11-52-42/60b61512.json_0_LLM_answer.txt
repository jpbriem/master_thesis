LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

But the actual result is different. The model predicts all zeros for test input. I don't understand why this happens. Can someone explain to me what's going on?

Answer: It looks like your model has learned a trivial solution, meaning it always outputs zero regardless of the input. This can happen when the model is overfitting or underfitting. Here are some possible reasons why this might be happening:

1. Overfitting: The model might be too complex and has learned the noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns. As a result, it memorizes the training data rather than learning generalizable features. When it encounters new data (in this case, the test input), it doesn't know how to handle it and outputs all zeros. To address overfitting, you can try regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping.
2. Underfitting: The model might be too simple and cannot capture the complexity of the training data. As a result, it fails to learn useful features and always outputs zeros. To address underfitting, you can try increasing the capacity of the model, adding more layers or units, or using a more sophisticated architecture.
3. Training/Testing Imbalance: Another possibility is that there's an imbalance between the training and testing data. If the training data contains mostly zeros, the model might not have enough information to learn from, and it defaults to outputting zeros for the test data. You can check the distribution of values in your training and testing data and make sure they're similar. If necessary, you can oversample the minority class (in this case, non-zero values) or undersample the majority class (zeros) to balance the data.
4. Optimizer Issues: Lastly, the choice of optimizer could also contribute to the issue. Some optimizers, such as stochastic gradient descent, may converge to poor local minima, leading to suboptimal performance. Try experimenting with different optimizers, such as Adam or RMSProp, to see if they improve the results.

To troubleshoot further, you can try visualizing the training and testing data, investigating the model's weights and activations, or running experiments with different hyperparameters.
