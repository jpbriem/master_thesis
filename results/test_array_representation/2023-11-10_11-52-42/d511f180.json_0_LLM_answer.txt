My question is how can I make the network learn to predict the correct output for the given input?
I have tried different architecture and hyperparameters but it's not working as expected.
Please help me with this.

Answer: There are several things you can try to improve the performance of your neural network on this task:

1. Increase the size of the network: Try increasing the number of layers or the number of neurons in each layer. This will give the network more capacity to learn the patterns in the data.
2. Use a different activation function: The ReLU activation function may not be suitable for this task. Try using a different activation function such as sigmoid or tanh.
3. Regularization: Add regularization terms to the loss function to prevent overfitting. You can use dropout, L1 or L2 regularization.
4. Data augmentation: Augment the training data by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This will increase the size of the training data and help the network generalize better.
5. Batch normalization: Normalize the inputs to each layer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This will help the network converge faster and perform better.
6. Ensemble learning: Train multiple networks with different architectures and combine their predictions using ensemble learning techniques such as bagging or boosting.
7. Pre-processing: Apply pre-processing techniques such as normalization, feature scaling, and feature selection to the input data before feeding it to the network.
8. Different optimizers: Try different optimizers such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad to optimize the loss function.
9. Learning rate scheduling: Reduce the learning rate as the training progresses to prevent overshooting and improve convergence.
10. Early stopping: Stop training the network when the validation loss stops improving to prevent overfitting.

It's important to note that the best approach will depend on the specific problem and dataset, so you may need to experiment with different combinations of these techniques to find what works best for your particular case.
