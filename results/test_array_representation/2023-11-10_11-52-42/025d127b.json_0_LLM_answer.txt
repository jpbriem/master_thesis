LLM answer:


Expected result:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

But the actual result is different. The model predicts 6 instead of 4 in some places. I don't understand why this happens. Can someone explain to me what's going on?

Answer: It seems that your model has learned a pattern in the training data that is not generalizing well to new data. Specifically, it appears that the model has learned to recognize the pattern "4" in the input data and is predicting 6 instead of 4 in certain places because it is confusing the two numbers. This is likely due to the fact that the model has seen many more instances of the number 4 in the training data than the number 6, so it has become overfitting to the pattern.

There are several ways you can address this issue:

1. Increase the amount of training data: By increasing the amount of training data, you can help the model learn more diverse patterns and reduce its reliance on any single pattern.
2. Use a larger model: A larger model will have more capacity to learn more complex patterns in the data, which may help it generalize better to new data.
3. Regularization: You can use regularization techniques such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization to penalize the model for being too complex and encourage it to find simpler patterns in the data.
4. Data augmentation: You can apply data augmentation techniques to the training data to artificially increase the amount of training data. For example, you could randomly change the digit in some of the images to create more variation in the training set.
5. Ensemble methods: You can use ensemble methods like bagging or boosting to combine multiple models trained on the same data. This can help improve the overall performance by reducing the impact of any individual model's errors.
6. Test on a different dataset: If possible, test your model on a different dataset that is similar to the training data but contains different variations. This can give you an idea of how well the model will perform on real-world data.
