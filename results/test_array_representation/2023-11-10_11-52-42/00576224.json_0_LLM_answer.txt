LLM prompt:
train input:
[[8, 6], [6, 4]]
train output:
[[8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6, 8], [4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6], [8, 6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4]]

train input:
[[7, 9], [4, 3]]
train output:
[[7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [9, 7, 9, 7, 9, 7], [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4], [7, 9, 7, 9, 7, 9], [4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]]

test input:
[[3, 2], [7, 8]]

LLM answer:


Expected output:
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]
```

In this example, the model is trained on two different inputs and outputs. The first input is a matrix with dimensions (2, 2) and the second input is also a matrix with dimensions (2, 2). The corresponding outputs are also matrices with dimensions (2, 2) each.

The model learns to perform element-wise multiplication between the input and output pairs. When we provide a new input, it produces an output by performing element-wise multiplication with the learned weights. In this case, the expected output for the test input [[3, 2], [7, 8]] would be:

Output = [[3*7 + 2*8, 3*8 + 2*7], [7*3 + 8*2, 7*2 + 8*3]]

= [[21 + 16, 24 + 14], [14 + 16, 21 + 10]]

= [[37, 40], [18, 31]]

Therefore, the expected output for the test input is [[37, 40], [18, 31]].
