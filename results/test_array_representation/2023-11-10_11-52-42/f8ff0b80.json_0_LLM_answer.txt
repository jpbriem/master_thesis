LLM answer:

Expected output: [[6], [6], [6]]

I've tried different variations of the code and I can't seem to get it working. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

This is a simple neural network with one hidden layer, the first layer has 2 neurons and uses ReLU activation, the second layer also has 2 neurons and uses sigmoid activation by default. The last layer has 1 neuron and uses softmax activation by default.

The training data consists of 9 input vectors and corresponding output vectors. Each input vector has 10 elements, and each output vector has 3 elements.

The expected output for the test data should be [[6], [6], [6]], but the current implementation always outputs [[5], [5], [5]].

I've tried changing the activation functions, adding more hidden layers, adjusting learning rate and number of epochs, but nothing seems to work.

Can someone please point out what's going wrong?

Answer: There are several issues with your code:

1. The `forward` method does not use the activations functions correctly. Instead of applying the activation function to the output of the dot product, you are applying it to the input. This means that the output of the neuron is always positive, even when it should be negative.
2. The `backward` method is not computing the gradients correctly. You are computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases, but you are not updating the weights and biases correctly.
3. The `train` method is not using the gradients correctly. You are computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and biases, but you are not updating the weights and biases correctly.
4. The `train` method is not using the correct learning rate. You are using a learning rate of 0.01, which is too high. A good learning rate for this problem should be around 0.001 or 0.0001.
5. The `train` method is not regularizing the weights and biases. You
