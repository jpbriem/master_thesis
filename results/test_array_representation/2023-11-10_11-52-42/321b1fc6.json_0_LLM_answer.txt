LLM answer:


Expected output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

But the model is predicting this instead:

Predicted output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

As you can see, the predicted output is not matching the expected output. Can someone please help me understand what's going wrong? I have tried different architectures and hyperparameters but nothing seems to work.

Answer: The issue with your model is that it has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. This results in overfitting, where the model becomes very good at fitting the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns.

To address this, there are several approaches you can take:

1. Collect more data: Increasing the amount of training data can help the model generalize better to new inputs.
2. Use a smaller model architecture: Reducing the number of parameters in the model can help prevent overfitting. You can try using a smaller CNN architecture or a simpler fully connected neural network.
3. Regularization techniques: You can use regularization techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, or batch normalization to reduce overfitting.
4. Use early stopping: Early stopping is a technique where you stop training the model when its performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This helps prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before the model has a chance to adapt to the noise in the training data.
5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique where you artificially increase the size of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to the images. This can help the model generalize better to new inputs.

By implementing one or more of these strategies, you should be able to improve the performance of your model on the test data.
