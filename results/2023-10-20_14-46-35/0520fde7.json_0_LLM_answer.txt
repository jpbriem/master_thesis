End of example.
In this example, the training data consists of 6 inputs and their corresponding outputs. The test data also consists of 3 inputs and their corresponding outputs. The model is trained on the training data using the backpropagation algorithm to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new inputs, such as the test inputs in this example.

The model has learned that there are two possible outputs for each input (a or c), based on the patterns in the training data. It has also learned that the first input (b) always produces an output of "a", and the second input (a) always produces an output of "c". These are just simple examples, but the model can be extended to handle more complex relationships between the inputs and outputs by adding more training data or adjusting the architecture of the model.
