In this example, the training data consists of five inputs and their corresponding outputs. The first four examples are used to train the classifier, while the last example is used as test data to evaluate its performance. As before, we use the same set of features (i.e., the number of times each letter appears in the input sequence) for all examples.
The classifier has learned to recognize the following patterns in the input data:
* In the first two examples, it has learned that when the input sequence starts with "a", followed by "i" twice, then "a" again, it is likely to be classified as "c".
* In the third example, it has learned that when the input sequence starts with "i" three times, followed by "a" once, then "i" again, it is likely to be classified as "c".
* In the fourth example, it has learned that when the input sequence starts with "a" twice, followed by "i" once, then "a" again, it is likely to be classified as "c".
* In the fifth example, it has learned that when the input sequence starts with "a" three times, followed by "i" twice, then "a" again, it is likely to be classified as "c".
As expected, the classifier performs well on the test data, correctly identifying all five examples as "c".
