The first line of the `train` file contains a list of input-output pairs for training the model. Each pair consists of two lines, where the first line is the input and the second line is the corresponding output. The inputs are represented as strings of characters, and the outputs are also represented as strings of characters.

For example, in the first pair, the input is `i, g`, which means that the model should predict the output string `g`. Similarly, the input `g, i` means that the model should predict the output string `i`.

The `test` file contains a set of input-output pairs that can be used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. As before, each pair consists of two lines, where the first line is the input and the second line is the corresponding output.

For example, in the first pair of the `test` file, the input is `b, e`, which means that the model should predict the output string `b`. Similarly, the input `e, j` means that the model should predict the output string `j`.

Note that the `train` and `test` files contain different sets of input-output pairs. This is because the training data is designed to help the model learn the patterns in the language, while the test data is designed to evaluate how well the model can generalize to new, unseen examples.
