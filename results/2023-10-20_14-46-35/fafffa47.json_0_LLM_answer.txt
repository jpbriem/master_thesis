As you can see, the training examples are in the format `input1, input2,...`, and the corresponding output is given after each set of inputs. The test input is also provided at the end for comparison with the predicted output.

To use this dataset to train an LSTM model, you would need to preprocess the data by tokenizing the words (e.g., using the `nltk` library in Python), converting them to numerical representations (e.g., using the `word2vec` library), and then feeding the preprocessed data into the LSTM model. You may also want to consider techniques such as padding or truncating the sequences to ensure that all inputs have the same length, and normalizing the input data to improve generalization.
