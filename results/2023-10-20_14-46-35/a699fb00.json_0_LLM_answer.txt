In this example, the training data consists of 8 examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs. The first 4 examples are used to train the model, and the last 4 examples are used for testing purposes. The model is able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs from these examples, and can then use this knowledge to make predictions on new, unseen data.

To train the model, we need to provide it with a set of input-output pairs that it can learn from. These pairs are typically referred to as "training data", and they are used by the model to learn the patterns and relationships between the inputs and outputs. In this case, we have provided the model with 8 training examples, each consisting of an input (represented by a sequence of 8 values) followed by its corresponding output (also represented by a sequence of 8 values).

Once the model has been trained, we can test it using a separate set of input-output pairs that it has not seen before. This set is called the "test data". By comparing the predicted outputs of the model with the actual outputs, we can evaluate how well it has learned the patterns in the training data and determine whether it is likely to be useful for making predictions on new, unseen data.
