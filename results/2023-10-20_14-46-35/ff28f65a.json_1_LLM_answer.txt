In this example, the training data consists of 8 examples, where each example is a sequence of 4 inputs (or features) and one output. The first 4 examples are used to train the model, and the last 4 examples are used for testing. Each input sequence is represented as a string of characters, where each character corresponds to a feature or attribute in the input data. For example, in the first example, the input sequence "c, c, a, a" represents an instance of the class "a", and the output is "b".

The model has learned that the class "a" is associated with the input sequence "c, c, a, a", and the class "b" is associated with the input sequence "c, c, a, a". This is just one simple example of how a machine learning model can be trained on text data. In practice, more complex models and techniques may be used to handle larger and more complex datasets.
