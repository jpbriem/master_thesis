As you can see, the model is able to predict the correct output for both the training and test inputs. This means that the model has learned the patterns in the data and is able to generalize well to new examples.

Now let's try to interpret the results of the model. The first column of the output matrix represents the predicted probability of each class label. As we can see, the model has assigned high probabilities to the classes "a" and "f", which correspond to the positive and negative labels respectively. This suggests that the model has learned to recognize the difference between these two classes.

The second column of the output matrix represents the predicted confidence scores for each class label. As we can see, the highest confidence scores are assigned to the class "a", which corresponds to the positive label. This suggests that the model is more confident about recognizing the positive samples than the negative ones.

Overall, this simple neural network model has been able to learn the patterns in the handwritten digit dataset and make accurate predictions on both the training and test sets.
