In this example, the training data consists of 8 examples, where each example is a sequence of 4 inputs (color values) and their corresponding outputs (labels). The labels are either `b` or `a`, which represent the two possible classes in our binary classification problem.

The first line of each example specifies the input sequence, followed by the output label. For example, in the first example, the input sequence is `c, c, a, c`, and the output label is `b`.

To train the model using this data, we would feed it into the neural network one example at a time, adjusting the weights and biases based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output. We would repeat this process many times, gradually improving the performance of the model as we go.

Once the model has been trained, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. To do this, we simply feed the new data into the model, and it will output the predicted class label.
