In this example, the training data consists of three inputs (i, c, and d) followed by one or more outputs (a, b, or d). The test data consists of three inputs (d, i, and b) followed by one or more outputs (d, b, or d). Each input is represented by a sequence of characters, where each character represents a different feature in the input data. For example, the first input (i) has features "i", "c", and "i". The second input (c) has features "c", "i", and "c". The third input (d) has features "d", "i", and "d". Similarly, the first output (d) has features "d" repeated 5 times, while the second output (b) has features "b" repeated 3 times.
The neural network was trained using backpropagation to learn the weights and biases for each layer based on the training data. During training, the network was presented with an input sequence and the corresponding output sequence, and it adjusted its weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This process was repeated many times until the network converged to an optimal set of weights and biases that could accurately predict the output given the input. Once the network was trained, it was tested on the test data to evaluate its performance. In this case, the network correctly predicted all 12 outputs for the test data.
