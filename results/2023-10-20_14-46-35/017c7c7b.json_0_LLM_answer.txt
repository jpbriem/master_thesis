The first line of the `train` file contains the number of samples in the training set (in this case, 5). Each subsequent line contains a triplet of inputs and outputs, where each input is represented as a single character (either 'a' or 'b'), and each output is also represented as a single character (again, either 'a' or 'b'). The last line of the `train` file indicates that there are 5 examples in total.

The `test` file works similarly, but it only contains 3 examples.
