In this example, the training data consists of 8 inputs (d or i) followed by one of four possible outputs (a, c, or e). The test data consists of 5 inputs (j) followed by one of two possible outputs (j or a).
The neural network was trained using the backpropagation algorithm to learn the weights and biases for each layer in order to predict the correct output given an input. In this case, the network has learned that the best way to predict the output is based on the input values themselves, without any additional information. This type of neural network is called a perceptron because it learns a linear decision boundary between the different classes.
Perceptrons are simple to implement but have some limitations. They can only solve binary classification problems (where the number of classes is small), and they cannot handle non-linearly separable data. Non-linearly separable data means that the classes cannot be separated by a single hyperplane, but rather require a complex decision boundary. To overcome these limitations, more advanced neural networks such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) were developed.
