The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 4). Each subsequent line contains a sequence of four inputs and their corresponding outputs. The inputs are represented as integers, ranging from 0 to 3, and the outputs are also represented as integers, but with an additional constraint that the last output must be the same as the first output (i.e., the loop is guaranteed to terminate).

For example, the first input in the first row is `a`, which means that the model should produce the output `a` when given the input `a`. Similarly, the second input in the first row is `a`, which means that the model should produce the output `a` when given the input `a`. And so on.

The `test` file contains a single line of input, followed by multiple lines of output. In this case, there are three inputs (`e`, `a`, and `a`) and three corresponding outputs (`a`, `a`, and `a`).

Your task is to write a program that can read these files and use them to train and test a simple neural network. Specifically, you should implement the following functions:

1. `read_train()`: reads the training data from the `train` file and returns a list of tuples containing the inputs and outputs for each example.
2. `read_test()`: reads the testing data from the `test` file and returns a list of tuples containing the inputs and outputs for each example.
3. `train_network()`: trains the neural network using the training data returned by `read_train()`.
4. `test_network()`: tests the trained neural network using the testing data returned by `read_test()`.
5. `predict()`: takes a single input and uses the trained neural network to predict its corresponding output.

Here's an example of how you could implement these functions in Python:
```
import numpy as np

def read_train(file):
    # Read the training data from the file
    inputs = []
    outputs = []
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            inputs.append(int(line[0]))
            outputs.append(int(line[1]))
    return inputs, outputs

def read_test(file):
    # Read the testing data from the file
    inputs = []
    outputs = []
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            inputs.append(int(line[0]))
            outputs.append(int(line[1]))
    return inputs, outputs

def train_network(inputs, outputs):
    # Train the neural network using the training data
    #...

def test_network(inputs):
    # Test the trained neural network using the testing data
    #...

def predict(input):
    # Use the trained neural network to predict the output for a given input
    #...
```
Note that this is just one possible way to implement these functions, and you may need to modify them depending on the specific requirements of your assignment. Good luck!
