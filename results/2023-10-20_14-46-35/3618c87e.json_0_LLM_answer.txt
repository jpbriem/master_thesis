This is just one simple example of how the model could be trained and tested on different inputs and outputs. In practice, you would need to have more examples of both the training data (inputs and corresponding labels) and test data (inputs that are not used during training but can be used to evaluate the performance of the model). Additionally, you may want to use techniques such as regularization or early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.
