In this example, we have a neural network with three inputs and one output. The training data consists of six examples, each with three inputs and one output. We use the `train` function to train the network on the training data, and the `test` function to test it on the test data.

The first example shows that the network can learn to recognize the number 1. The second example shows that the network can learn to recognize the number 2. The third example shows that the network can learn to recognize the number 3. The fourth example shows that the network can learn to recognize the number 4. The fifth example shows that the network can learn to recognize the number 5. The sixth example shows that the network can learn to recognize the number 6.

The test input in the last example is `(7, 7, 0)`, which should produce an output of `1`. This demonstrates that the network has learned to recognize the numbers 1 through 6, and can generalize to new inputs.
