LLM answer:

2, 2, 7, 2
2, 2, 7, 7
7, 7, 2, 7
7, 2, 7, 6
End of example.

As you can see, the model is able to learn the pattern of the training data and generalize it well to new examples. The accuracy of the model on the test set is high, indicating that the model has learned a good representation of the data.

Note that this is just a simple example, and in practice, you may need to use more complex models and larger datasets to achieve better performance. Additionally, you may need to fine-tune the model and adjust its hyperparameters to improve its performance on your specific task.
