LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

I think this is a very interesting problem. I will try to solve it using Python.

First, let's define some helper functions:

```python
def flip(arr):
    """Flips the array horizontally."""
    return arr[::-1]

def reverse(arr):
    """Reverses the array vertically."""
    return arr[::-1]

def transpose(arr):
    """Transposes the array."""
    n = len(arr)
    return [[arr[i][j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]

def mirror(arr):
    """Mirrors the array diagonally."""
    n = len(arr)
    return [[arr[i][n - i - 1] for i in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

def scale(arr, factor):
    """Scales the array."""
    return [[x * factor for x in row] for row in arr]

def shear(arr, angle):
    """Shears the array."""
    n = len(arr)
    return [[x * math.cos(angle) + y * math.sin(angle) for y, x in zip(range(n), range(n))] for _ in range(n)]

def translate(arr, dx, dy):
    """Translates the array."""
    return [[x + dx for x in row] for row in arr]

def contain(arr, min_val, max_val):
    """Returns True if all elements in the array are between min_val and max_val."""
    for row in arr:
        for val in row:
            if val < min_val or val > max_val:
                return False
    return True

def touch(arr, min_dist):
    """Returns True if any two elements in the array are separated by less than min_dist."""
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            d = math.sqrt((arr[i][0] - arr[j][0])**2 + (arr[i][1] - arr[j][1])**2)
            if d < min_dist:
                return True
    return False

def count(arr):
    """Counts the number of elements in the array."""
    return sum([len(row) for row in arr])

def sort(arr):
    """Sorts the array."""
    return sorted(arr)

def group(arr, key=lambda x: x[0]):
    """Groups the array by a key function."""
    return [list(group) for _, group in itertools.groupby(arr, key)]

def merge(arr1, arr2):
    """Merges two arrays into one."""
    return [[x for x in row1 if x not in row2] + [x for x in row2 if x not in row1] for row1, row2 in zip(arr1, arr2)]

def split(arr, n):
    """Splits the array into n sub-arrays."""
    return [arr[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(arr), n)]

def pad(arr, padding):
    """Pads the array with zeros."""
    return [[x + [0]*(padding - len(x)) for x in row] for row in arr]

def remove_zeros(arr):
    """Removes all rows containing only zeros."""
    return [[x for x in row if x!= 0] for row in arr]

def remove_duplicates(arr):
    """Removes duplicate rows."""
    return list(set(arr))

def remove_empty(arr):
    """Removes empty rows."""
    return [[x for x in row if x!= 0] for row in arr]

def remove_noise(arr):
    """Removes noise pixels."""
    threshold = 0.1
    return [[x for x in row if abs(x) > threshold] for row in arr]
