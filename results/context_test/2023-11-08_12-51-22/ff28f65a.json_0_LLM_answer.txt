LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a color. The task is to find the simplest relationship between the input and output grids, described using six fields: reflection, grid changes, pixel changes, object changes, overall pattern, and instructions. The goal is to describe the transformation actions in detail, step by step, and apply them to the test input grid to produce the test output grid.

The input grid has dimensions 6x6, while the output grid has dimensions 4x4. The input grid contains six objects - two yellow objects in the top left and bottom right corners, two green objects in the middle rows, and two blue objects in the top right and bottom left corners. The output grid contains three objects - one red object in the center, surrounded by three yellow objects.

To create the output grid, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Reflection: None
2. Grid Changes: Dimensions reduced from 6x6 to 4x4 by cutting off the top two and bottom two rows and columns.
3. Pixel Changes: Yellow pixels changed to red in the center, while keeping the surrounding green and blue pixels unchanged.
4. Object Changes: Two yellow objects merged into one red object in the center, while the remaining four objects remain unchanged.
5. Overall Pattern: Simple replacement of yellow with red in the center, while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.
6. Instructions:
* Cut off the top two and bottom two rows and columns of the input grid.
* Replace yellow pixels in the center with red.
* Keep the remaining pixels unchanged.
7. Test Output:
[1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0]

The simplified explanation of the transformation is: cut off the top and bottom rows and columns, replace yellow with red in the center, and keep the rest of the grid unchanged.
