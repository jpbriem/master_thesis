LLM prompt:
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

This is an example of a task from a machine learning competition. It is a regression problem, where you are given input data and expected output data, and your goal is to learn a mapping between them so that you can predict the output for new, unseen input data. In this case, the input data consists of 2D grids of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 9, and the output data consists of corresponding 2D grids of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 9.

The task is to infer the simplest possible relation between the input and output data. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities, so you should try to generalize the patterns observed in the training data to handle new input data.

To solve this problem, you can analyze the given input-output pairs and look for common patterns, symmetries, or relationships between the pixels. You can also try to identify objects or shapes in the grid and their properties, such as size, position, value, etc. Based on these observations, you can create a model or algorithm that can generate the output grid for a given input grid.

Here are some examples of input-output pairs from the training data:

* Input: [['0', '2', '0'], ['0', '0', '5']], Output: [['0', '0', '0'], ['0', '3', '6']]
* Input: [['0', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']], Output: [['0', '1', '5', '4', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']]
* Input: [['0', '2', '2', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']], Output: [['0', '2', '7', '9', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']]
* Input: [['0', '3', '3', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']], Output: [['0', '3', '8', '7', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']]

Based on these examples, we can observe that there are certain patterns and relationships between the pixels in the input and output grids. For instance, in the first example, the top-left corner of the output grid has the same value as the top-left corner of the input grid, while the bottom-right corner of the output grid has the same value as the bottom-right corner of the input grid. Similarly, in the second example, the middle row of the output grid has the same values as the middle row of the input grid, but shifted one pixel to the right.

Your task is to identify and generalize these patterns to create a model that can produce the output grid for any given input grid. You can use various techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, image processing algorithms, or mathematical formulas, to solve this problem. Once you have developed your model, you can use it to predict the output for the test input data provided above.
