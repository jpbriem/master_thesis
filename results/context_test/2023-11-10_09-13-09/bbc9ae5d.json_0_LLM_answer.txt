You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "Describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",

"instructions": "Describe the transformation actions in detail step by step",
"test_output": "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"
}

Here are the observations and descriptions of the input-output pairs:

1. Input: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], Output: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Reflection: None
* Grid changes: None
* Pixel changes: None
* Object changes: None
* Overall pattern: Identity mapping
* Instructions: None

2. Input: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], Output: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Reflection: None
* Grid changes: None
* Pixel changes: None
* Object changes: None
* Overall pattern: Identity mapping
* Instructions: None

3. Input: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], Output: [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Reflection: None
* Grid changes: None
* Pixel changes: None
* Object changes: None
* Overall pattern: Identity mapping
* Instructions: None

4. Input: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], Output: [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]
* Reflection: None
* Grid changes: None
* Pixel changes: None
* Object changes: None
* Overall pattern: Identity mapping
* Instructions: None

5. Input: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], Output: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Reflection: None
* Grid changes: None
* Pixel changes: None
* Object changes: None
* Overall pattern: Identity mapping
* Instructions: None

6. Test input: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
* Expected output: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Based on the input-output pairs, the simplest input-output relationship is an identity mapping, where the output is identical to the input. There are no changes in the grid dimensions, pixel values, or object positions. Therefore, the instructions for transforming the test input grid would be simply to return the input grid itself, without any modifications.
