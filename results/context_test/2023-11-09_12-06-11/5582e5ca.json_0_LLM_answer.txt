You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

LLM answer:
  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid",
"pixel_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes",
"object_changes": "Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count",

The given input-output pairs share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background.

The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is that the output is a transformed version of the input, where the transformation involves changing the color of certain pixels. The transformation is based on the geometry and topology of the input grid, specifically involving symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, and scaling.

The instructions for transforming the input grid to get the output grid are as follows:

1. Reflect the input grid vertically.
2. Rotate the input grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
3. Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
4. Translate the input grid by (2, 1) pixels.
5. Change the color of pixel (1, 1) to '9'.
6. Change the color of pixel (2, 2) to '6'.
7. Change the color of pixel (3, 3) to '3'.

Using these instructions, the test input grid can be transformed to get the test output grid:

Test input grid:
8, 8, 6
4, 6, 9
8, 3, 0

Transformed grid:
9, 9, 6
6, 6, 9
8, 3, 0

Therefore, the test output grid is:
9, 9, 6
6, 6, 9
8, 3, 0
