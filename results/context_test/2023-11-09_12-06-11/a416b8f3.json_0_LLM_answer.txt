You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

  {
"reflection": "Reflect on the answer",
"grid_changes": "The dimension of the input grid is different from the output grid. The input grid has 3 rows and 4 columns, while the output grid has 4 rows and 4 columns.",
"pixel_changes": "There are changes in the pixel values between the input and output grids. The input grid contains the values 4, 5, and 6, while the output grid contains the values 4, 5, 6, and 1.",
"object_changes": "There are changes in the objects between the input and output grids. The input grid contains three objects - a rectangle with value 4 in the top left corner, a rectangle with value 5 in the middle, and a rectangle with value 6 in the bottom right corner. The output grid contains four objects - a rectangle with value 4 in the top left corner, a rectangle with value 5 in the middle, a rectangle with value 6 in the bottom right corner, and a new rectangle with value 1 in the top right corner.",
"overall_pattern": "The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs is a reflection around the diagonal axis, followed by a translation upwards and to the right, and finally, a scaling up of the grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.",
"instructions": "To apply the transformation, first reflect the input grid around the diagonal axis. Then, translate the grid upwards and to the right by 2 units. Finally, scale the grid up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.",
"test_output": "The resulting output grid after applying the transformation to the test input grid is:

4, 5, 6, 1
4, 5, 6, 1
0, 5, 6, 1
0, 0, 0, 1"
