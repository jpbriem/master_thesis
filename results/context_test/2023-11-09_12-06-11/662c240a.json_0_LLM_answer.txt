You are given a series of inputs and output pairs that share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background. No calculations! For example, [['0','2','0'],['0','0','5']] represents a 2 row x 3 column grid with color '2' at position (1,0) and color '5' at position (2,1). The coordinates are 2D coordinates (row, column), row representing row number, column representing col number, with zero-indexing.
You are to infer the simplest possible relation beetween input and output. The given sample pairs may not reflect all possibilities.

You can refer to concepts as follows:
- Goal-directedness: input is start and output is end state of process 
- Geometry & topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have contact with each other.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes pixels:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

You are to output only the following in json format: {'reflection': 'reflect on the answer', 'grid_changes': 'describe if the dimension of the input grid is different to its output grid', 'pixel_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on movement, object number, size, shape, position, value, cell count', 'overall_pattern': 'describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_output': "Use the instructions to transform the test input grid and return only the resulting output grid"}.
Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code.

The given input-output pairs share the same logic of getting the output from its input. Each input and output is a 2-dimensional grid of pixels. The values from '0' to '9' represent different colors, where '0' represents the background.

Based on the given examples, we can observe that the transformation involves changing the color of certain pixels while maintaining the overall structure of the grid. The transformed output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids.

The simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs can be described as follows:

* Reflect the input grid vertically or horizontally, or both.
* Change the color of certain pixels based on their positions and values.

To describe the changes between the input and output pixels, we can focus on movement or pattern changes. For instance, in the first example, the top-left corner of the input grid has moved to the bottom-right corner of the output grid, while the rest of the pixels have remained unchanged. In the second example, the middle row of the input grid has been reversed in the output grid, while the rest of the pixels have remained unchanged.

Regarding object changes, we can see that the objects in the input grid have either moved or changed color in the output grid. For example, in the third example, the top-left object has moved to the bottom-right corner of the output grid, while the rest of the objects have remained unchanged. In the fourth example, the middle object has changed color from green to red in the output grid.

Overall, the transformation actions can be described step by step as follows:

1. Reflect the input grid vertically or horizontally, or both.
2. Change the color of certain pixels based on their positions and values.
3. Move or change the color of certain objects in the grid.

Now, let's apply these transformation actions to the test input grid:

Test Input Grid:
5, 4, 4
4, 5, 4
4, 5, 4
3, 3, 2
3, 3, 2
2, 2, 3
1, 1, 1
1, 8, 8
1, 8, 8

Applying the transformation actions, we get:

Test Output Grid:
8, 8, 4
4, 4, 4
4, 4, 8
3, 3, 2
3, 3, 2
2, 2, 3
1, 1, 1
1, 8, 8
1, 8, 8

Therefore, the test output grid is the same as the test input grid, but with the colors adjusted according to the rules described above.
