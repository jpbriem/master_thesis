LLM answer for tasks 1:
5, 5
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of samples in the training set (in this case, 4). Each subsequent line specifies a single sample, with each digit representing the value of a particular feature at that sample point. For example, the first sample has values of 0 for features 0 and 2, and values of 2 for features 1 and 3. The last line of the `train` file is blank, indicating the end of the training data.

The `test` file contains the same format as the `train` file, but only contains five samples instead of four. This is because there are only five samples in the test set.

You can use these examples to train your neural network on the given dataset using the `train_neural_network()` function from the `machinelearning` module, like so:
```
from machinelearning import train_neural_network

# Load the training data
train_data = []
with open('train.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        train_data.append(map(int, line.split()))

# Train the neural network
model = train_neural_network(train_data, num_features=3)

# Make predictions on the test data
test_data = []
with open('test.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        test_data.append(map(int, line.split()))
predictions = model.predict(test_data)

print("Predicted outputs:", predictions)
```
This code will train a simple neural network on the given dataset and then make predictions on the test data. You can modify the `num_features` parameter in the `train_neural_network()` function to change the number of features used by the neural network.
