End of example.

As you can see, the training and test inputs are represented as matrices with dimensions `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples in the dataset and `n_features` is the number of features in each sample. Each element in the matrix corresponds to a single feature value for that sample.

The training output is also represented as a matrix, which shows the predicted labels for each sample in the training set. The test output is not provided in this case, since it is not available during training.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
