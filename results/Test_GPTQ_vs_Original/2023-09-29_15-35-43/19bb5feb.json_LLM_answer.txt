As you can see, the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as matrices with dimensions `(784,)` and `(10,)`, respectively, where each row represents a single input sample. The `train` matrix contains the training data, while the `test` matrix contains the test data.

The `train` and `test` outputs are also represented as matrices with dimensions `(10,)`. Each row in the `train` output matrix corresponds to one of the 10 possible classes (0-9), and indicates the class label for that particular input sample. Similarly, each row in the `test` output matrix corresponds to one of the 10 possible classes, and indicates the class label for that particular input sample.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
