4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain values of 0 or 1). The training algorithm is learning to recognize patterns in these inputs, and it's doing a pretty good job! The test outputs also show that the trained model can correctly classify new inputs as either "4" or "not 4".
