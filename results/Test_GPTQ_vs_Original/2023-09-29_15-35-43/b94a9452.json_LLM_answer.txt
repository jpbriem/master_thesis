LLM answer for tasks 1:
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
5, 5, 5, 5, 5
End of example.
\end{code}

As you can see, the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as lists of integers, while the `train` and `test` outputs are represented as lists of integers or floats, depending on whether the problem is a regression or classification problem. The examples provided in the code are simple binary classification problems, where each input has two possible labels (either 0 or 1), and the goal is to predict the correct label for each input.
