LLM answer for tasks 1:
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
End of example.
Note that the last two examples have a different number of inputs and outputs than the previous ones. This is because the last two examples are using a different set of weights for the neural network, which results in different output values for the same input values.
