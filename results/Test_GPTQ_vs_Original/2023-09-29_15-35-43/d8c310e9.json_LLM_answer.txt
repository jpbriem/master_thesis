As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output for a given input. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize certain patterns in the data, such as the presence or absence of certain features (e.g., the value of the second feature), and it uses this knowledge to make predictions about new inputs that it hasn't seen before.
