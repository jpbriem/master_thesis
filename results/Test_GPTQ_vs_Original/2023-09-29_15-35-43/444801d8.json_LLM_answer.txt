As you can see, the training and test sets have different outputs for some inputs. This is because the model has learned to recognize certain patterns in the data during training, but these patterns may not be present in the test set. Therefore, it's important to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on a separate test set to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.
