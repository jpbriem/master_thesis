The first line of the `train` file contains the number of inputs and outputs in each sample. The next lines contain the input values separated by spaces, followed by a space, and then the corresponding output values separated by spaces. Each sample is represented as a single line.

For example, in the first sample, the input values are `0`, `8`, `0`, and `8`, which correspond to the output values `8, 0, 0, 8`. Similarly, in the second sample, the input values are `2`, `2`, `2`, which correspond to the output values `0, 2, 2, 0`.

Note that some samples may have fewer input values than others, depending on the problem being solved. In these cases, the missing values will be represented by `0`.
