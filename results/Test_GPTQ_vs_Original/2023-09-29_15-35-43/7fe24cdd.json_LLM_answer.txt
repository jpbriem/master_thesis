LLM answer for tasks 1:
2, 5, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0
2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1
0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains a list of inputs and outputs for each sample in the training set. Each input is represented as a vector of integers, with each element corresponding to a feature in the input data. The corresponding output value is also provided.

In this case, there are three samples in the training set, labeled `sample1`, `sample2`, and `sample3`. For each sample, we provide two inputs (`input1` and `input2`) and their corresponding outputs (`output1` and `output2`).

For example, in `sample1`, the input values are `8, 5, 0`, which correspond to the third row of the input matrix in the example above. The output value for this sample is `8, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8`, which corresponds to the fourth row of the output matrix in the example above.

Similarly, in `sample2`, the input values are `8, 5, 3`, which correspond to the fifth row of the input matrix in the example above. The output value for this sample is `8, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5`, which corresponds to the sixth row of the output matrix in the example above.

And so on.

The second line of the `train` file contains a list of integers representing the number of features in each input sample. In this case, there are 3 features in each input sample.

The third line of the `train` file contains a list of integers representing the number of classes in the output variable. In this case, there are 4 classes in the output variable (0, 1, 2, and 3).

The rest of the lines in the `train` file contain pairs of input and output values for each sample in the training set. These pairs are used by the machine learning algorithm to learn the relationship between the input variables and the output variable.
