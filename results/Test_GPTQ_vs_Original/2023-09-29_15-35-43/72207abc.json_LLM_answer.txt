As you can see, the training and test inputs are all zeroes, but the training output is not. This means that the neural network has learned something from the training data, even though there is no actual pattern in the input data.

This is a common problem in deep learning, known as overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. In this case, the neural network has learned to produce outputs based on the random fluctuations in the training data, rather than learning any meaningful patterns.

To address this problem, we need to use techniques such as regularization to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data. Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the model from fitting too closely to the training data. This encourages the model to find a more general solution that will work well on new, unseen data.
