LLM answer for tasks 1:
2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1
2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2
2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2
1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test outputs are identical, which means that the trained model is able to accurately predict the labels for new examples.
