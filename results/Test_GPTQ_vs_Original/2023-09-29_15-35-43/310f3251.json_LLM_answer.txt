End of example.

As you can see, the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as matrices with dimensions `(num_inputs, num_outputs)`, where each row represents a single input or output. The `train` matrix contains the training data, while the `test` matrix contains the test data.

The `train` output is also represented as a matrix with dimensions `(num_outputs,)`), where each column represents a single output. The `test` output is similarly represented as a matrix with dimensions `(num_outputs,)`.

In this case, the number of inputs (`num_inputs`) and outputs (`num_outputs`) are both equal to 3, so the matrices have dimensions `(3, 3)` for the `train` matrix and `(3,)` for the `test` matrix.
