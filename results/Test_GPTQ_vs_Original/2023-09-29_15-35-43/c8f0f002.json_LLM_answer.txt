5, 8, 7, 1, 8
5, 1, 8, 7, 5
End of example.
test input:
7, 1, 1, 7, 7
1, 8, 1, 7, 1
7, 1, 8, 7, 7
test output:
5, 5, 5, 1, 1
1, 8, 1, 5, 1
5, 1, 5, 1, 5
End of example.
test input:
1, 8, 8, 7, 7
7, 1, 7, 7, 8
7, 7, 1, 8, 7
test output:
1, 8, 1, 5, 1
5, 8, 7, 1, 8
5, 1, 7, 8, 5
End of example.
Note that the test inputs and outputs are generated using a different algorithm than the training data, to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.
