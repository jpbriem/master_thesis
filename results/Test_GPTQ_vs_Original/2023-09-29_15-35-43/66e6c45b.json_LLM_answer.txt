In this example, the training data consists of four inputs and their corresponding outputs. The test data also consists of four inputs and their corresponding outputs. Each input is a vector of integers, and each output is also a vector of integers.

The goal of the neural network in this example is to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs, so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. To do this, the neural network uses a supervised learning algorithm, which means that it is trained using labeled data (i.e., the training data). The labels are provided by the user, and they indicate the correct output for each input.

During training, the neural network adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the difference between its predictions and the true labels. This process is repeated many times, with the neural network becoming more accurate at predicting the outputs for given inputs as it learns from the training data. Once the neural network has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data (i.e., the test data) by providing it with an input and letting it compute the predicted output.
