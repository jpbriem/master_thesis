End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are different from each other. The training data consists of a sequence of 1's and 0's, while the test data contains a mix of 1's and 0's with some random values added to it. This is done to simulate real-world scenarios where the model may encounter new or unseen data during deployment.
To train the model using this dataset, we would use the `fit()` method provided by Keras, passing in the training data as an argument. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to train a simple neural network on this dataset:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Create the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=1, input_shape=(10,), activation='sigmoid'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model with a loss function and optimizer
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```
In this example, we create a simple neural network with two layers: the first layer has 10 units and uses the sigmoid activation function, while the second layer has 1 unit and also uses the sigmoid activation function. We then compile the model with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. Finally, we train the
