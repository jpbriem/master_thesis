0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data, and it applies those patterns to the test data as well. In this case, the neural network has learned that a sequence of 0s and 1s with a certain pattern of ones and zeros will always result in an output of 0 or 1, regardless of what the actual input is.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
