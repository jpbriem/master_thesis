End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are both binary classification problems, where the target variable is either 0 or 1. The training data consists of 4 examples per class (for a total of 16 examples), while the test data consists of 5 examples per class (for a total of 25 examples).

To use this dataset for training an ML model, you would need to preprocess the data by converting the categorical variables into numerical features using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. You could then split the data into training and validation sets using techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, and use the training set to train your ML model. Once trained, you could evaluate the performance of your model on the validation set, and fine-tune it as needed before evaluating its performance on the test set.
