2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2
2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are identical, but the model is able to correctly classify them as different classes (0 and 2). This demonstrates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data and is able to generalize well to new examples.
