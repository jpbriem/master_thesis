End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors (i.e., they only contain values of 0 or 1), but the outputs are not necessarily binary. In fact, in this case, the outputs are often a mix of 0s and 1s, with some examples having more than one 1. This is because the neural network is learning to recognize patterns in the data that involve multiple features, rather than just relying on a single feature to make predictions.

To summarize, the main difference between training and testing in machine learning is that training involves using a dataset to learn the parameters of a model, while testing involves evaluating how well the trained model performs on new, unseen data. The goal of training is to find a good set of model parameters that allow the model to make accurate predictions on new data, while the goal of testing is to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data and does not overfit to the training data.
