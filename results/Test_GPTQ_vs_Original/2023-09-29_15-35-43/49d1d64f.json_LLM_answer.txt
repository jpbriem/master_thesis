LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 2, 8, 4
2, 2, 4, 4
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains a list of inputs and outputs for training the model. Each input is separated by a space from its corresponding output. The format of the inputs and outputs is as follows:

* Inputs are represented as lists of integers, with each integer representing a feature in the input data. For example, in the first example, the input `1, 2` represents two features: the value of the first feature is 1, and the value of the second feature is 2.
* Outputs are also represented as lists of integers, with each integer representing a class label. For example, in the first example, the output `0, 1, 2, 0` represents four class labels: the first element (0) corresponds to the first feature, the second element (1) corresponds to the second feature, and so on.

The purpose of the `train` file is to provide the model with examples of inputs and their corresponding outputs, which it can use to learn how to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this case, the model is being trained to predict the class label of an input based on its features.

The `test` file contains a set of inputs that were not used during training, along with their corresponding outputs. These inputs are used to evaluate the performance of the model after it has been trained.
