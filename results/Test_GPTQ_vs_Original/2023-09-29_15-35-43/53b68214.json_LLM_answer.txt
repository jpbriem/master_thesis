LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output for a given input. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize patterns in the data that allow it to make accurate predictions even when it doesn't have access to the exact input used during training.
