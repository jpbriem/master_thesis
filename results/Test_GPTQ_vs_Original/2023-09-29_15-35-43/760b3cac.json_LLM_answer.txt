LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
Note that the last row of the test input and output are different from the corresponding rows in the training data. This is because the model has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data and can generalize well to new inputs.
