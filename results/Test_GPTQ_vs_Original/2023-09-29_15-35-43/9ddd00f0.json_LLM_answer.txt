LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 8, 0, 8, 0
8, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 8, 0, 8, 8
0, 8, 0, 8, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training data consists of a sequence of binary digits (0 or 1) followed by a sequence of binary digits that are mirrored about the center digit. The test data is simply a single sequence of binary digits.
The neural network has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data and correctly outputs the corresponding sequence of binary digits for each input. For the test data, it correctly outputs the single sequence of binary digits provided as input.
