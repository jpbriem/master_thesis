Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two inputs and outputs are identical to the third two inputs and outputs.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer will depend on how much complexity you want your model to have. If it's too simple, it won't be able to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs. If it's too complex, it may overfit the data.

You could start with something like 10-20 neurons in the hidden layer and see if that works well.

Here's some sample code using TensorFlow:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
X =... # Your X matrix
y =... # Your y vector

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Define neural network architecture
input_dim = X.shape[1]
hidden_dim = 10
output_dim = y.shape[1]

w1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([input_dim, hidden_dim]))
b1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(hidden_dim))

w2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([hidden_dim, output_dim]))
b2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(output_dim))

def feedforward(x):
    z1 = tf.matmul(x, w1) + b1
    a1 = tf.nn.relu(z1)
    z2 = tf.matmul(a1, w2) + b2
    return z2

y_pred = feedforward(X_train)

# Compile model
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_train))
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer()
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_val = loss(y_pred, y_train)
gradients = tape.gradient(loss_val, [w1, b1, w2, b2])
saver = tf.train.Saver(max_num_var=1e10)
saver.restore(tf.global_variables(), 'checkpoint')

# Train model
for epoch in range(100):
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        for i in range(len(X_train)):
            x = X_train[i:i+1]
            y = y_train[i:i+1]
            gradients = tape.gradient(loss_val, [w1, b1, w2, b2])
            saver.save(tf.global_variables(), 'checkpoint')
            optimizer.minimize(loss_val, gradients)
        y_pred = feedforward(X_test)
        accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.equal(tf.argmax(y_pred, axis=1), tf.argmax(y_test, axis=1)))
        print('Epoch {}: Accuracy={}'.format(epoch, accuracy))
```
