Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output as the first two. The fourth example has a different input and output than all three previous ones.

## Answer (0)

I think this is because your `train_output` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. You should use `append(train_output)` instead of `train_output =...`.

Solution:
6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 6
8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8
