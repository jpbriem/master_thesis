Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two inputs are identical except for the order of the elements. The second two inputs are also identical except for the order of the elements. The third and fourth inputs are different.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a simple feedforward with one hidden layer.

The input layer will have `n_features` neurons, where `n_features` is the number of features in your data.

The output layer will have `n_classes` neurons, where `n_classes` is the number of classes you want to predict.

In the hidden layer, you can use any activation function that works well for your problem. For example, ReLU or sigmoid.

You can use scikit-learn to build and train your model. Here's an example code snippet:

```
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split your data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create your model
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(16,), max_iter=1000, solver='adam', verbose=0)

# Train your model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of your model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy: {:.2f}%'.format(accuracy * 100))
```

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization strength, etc., depending on your specific problem.
