Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same inputs and outputs". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesBrown The first two examples have the same inputs and outputs. The third example has different inputs but the same outputs as the first two. The fourth example has different inputs and outputs than all three previous examples.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network with one hidden layer. You can use a sigmoid activation function in the hidden layer to introduce non-linearity.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer will depend on how much complexity you want your model to have. If it doesn't work well, try increasing the number of neurons.

You may also need to adjust the learning rate and batch size depending on your data.
