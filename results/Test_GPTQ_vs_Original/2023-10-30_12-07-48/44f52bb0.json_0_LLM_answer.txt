Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

## Answer (3)

The problem is that you are using `np.array([[x, y], [y, x]])` to create your training data. This creates a matrix where each row represents a pair of values. However, in this case, you want to represent each value as a single column vector. So instead use `np.array([[x], [y]])`.

Also, you need to change the order of the columns when creating the test data. The first column should be the feature and the second column should be the label.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Generate some random data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5)

# Create the model
clf = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1), y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1))

print(y_pred)
```

Output:

```
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
```

Note that the `reshape` method is used to convert the 2D arrays into 1D arrays so that they can be passed to the `LogisticRegression` constructor.
