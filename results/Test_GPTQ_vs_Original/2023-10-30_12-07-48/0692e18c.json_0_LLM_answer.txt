Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The two examples have the same structure and the same values in them.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good solution for your problem:

```
def predict(X):
    # Get the number of features
    n_features = X.shape[1]

    # Create an empty array to store the predictions
    y_pred = np.zeros((len(X), n_features))

    # Loop through each row of the data
    for i in range(len(X)):
        # Get the current row
        x_i = X[i]

        # Check if the current row has all zeros
        if np.all(x_i == 0):
            # If it does, set all the predicted values to 0
            y_pred[i] = np.zeros(n_features)
        else:
            # Otherwise, use the decision tree model to make a prediction
            y_pred[i] = decisionTreeModel.predict([x_i])

    return y_pred
```

This function takes in the training data `X`, loops through each row of the data, checks if the current row has all zeros, and sets all the predicted values to 0 if it does. If the current row doesn't have all zeros, it uses the decision tree model to make a prediction.

You can then call this function with your test data like so:

```
y_pred = predict(testData)
```
