Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third example has a different input but the same output as the second example.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to see if it helps with overfitting.
