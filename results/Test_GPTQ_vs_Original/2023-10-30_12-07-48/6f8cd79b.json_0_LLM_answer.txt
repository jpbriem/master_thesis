Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @MichaelHampton The first two examples have the same input and output values. The third example has a different input but the same output as the first two. The fourth example has a different input and output than all three previous examples.

## Answer (2)

The problem is that your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent this.

You could also try using a different model architecture, for example a neural network with more hidden layers.

Comment: Thanks for the answer! I tried adding L1 regularization but it didn't help much. I will try a neural network with more hidden layers.
