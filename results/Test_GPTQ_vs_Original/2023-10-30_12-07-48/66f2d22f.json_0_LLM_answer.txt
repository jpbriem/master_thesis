Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please clarify?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The first two examples have the same input and output. The third one has a different input but the same output.

## Answer (1)

I think this is because your model is overfitting to the training data. You can try using regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.

You can also try using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.

Comment: Thanks for your answer! I tried adding L1 regularization with alpha = 0.01 and it didn't help much. I also tried using k-fold cross validation with k=5 and it didn't improve performance either.
