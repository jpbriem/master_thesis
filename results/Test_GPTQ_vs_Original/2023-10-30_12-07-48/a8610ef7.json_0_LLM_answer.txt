Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "these are the same". Can you please elaborate?

Comment: @JamesK.Polk The two inputs are identical except for the last digit. And the outputs are also identical except for the last digit. So they are the same in a sense.

## Answer (1)

I think this is a good fit for a neural network. You can use a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer and sigmoid activation function.

The number of neurons in the hidden layer should be equal to the number of features in your data. In your case it would be 6.

You can use scikit-learn library to implement this model. Here is an example code snippet:

```
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# create the model
clf = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(6,), max_iter=1000, solver='lbfgs', random_state=42)

# evaluate the model using cross validation
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)
print("Accuracy:", scores)
```

Note that `X` and `y` are your training data. Also note that you need to preprocess your data before feeding it into the model. For example, you may want to normalize or standardize your data.
