Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just has a bunch of weights and biases that are adjusted during training so as to minimize some error function. It's up to us humans to interpret those weights and biases in terms of recognizing patterns or whatever else we want them to do.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to understand how neural networks work.
\end{blockquote}

You can start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruquKk) video.

\begin{blockquote}

The network is trained to recognize the pattern.
\end{blockquote}

Yes, but this is only true for supervised learning. In unsupervised learning there is no target value (output).

\begin{blockquote}

But when I test my network on new data, why does it give me wrong results?
\end{blockquote}

Because your network was never trained to recognize these new inputs. You have to re-train your network using all available data.
