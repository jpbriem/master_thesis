Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It might happen that a particular set of weights and biases will result in an accurate prediction for your test data, but there are many other sets of weights and biases which would also give good results (and some which wouldn't). You can think of training as trying out lots of different possible networks until you find one which works well on your problem.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am wondering if this is how neural nets work?
\end{blockquote}

Yes, this is exactly how they work.

\begin{blockquote}

If so, then why do we need to use activation functions like sigmoid or tanh?
\end{blockquote}

Because without them, the gradient descent algorithm won't converge.

The reason is that the derivative of the cost function with respect to the weight $w$ is given by $\frac{\partial C}{\partial w_i}=\sum_{j=1}^n \delta_j x_j$, where $\delta_j$ is the delta value at node $j$. If all nodes have values between -1 and +1, then their derivatives will be zero, because $\tanh'(x)=sech^2(x)$ is always positive. So the gradient descent algorithm will never change any weights.

In practice, you don't want to use the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent functions directly, because they saturate too quickly. Instead, you should use [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) units, which are linear up to a certain point, and then become constant. This way, the gradients will remain non-zero even when the inputs get large.
