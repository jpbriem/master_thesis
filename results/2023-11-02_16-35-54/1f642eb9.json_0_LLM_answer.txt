Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the number of rows and columns". The first line is a single integer (in this case `1`), which is the number of examples in your training set. Then there are three lines for each example, with the first being the inputs, the second being the outputs, and the third being the desired outputs. So if you have an example with 10 inputs, then it will be represented as a vector of length 10 on the first line of that example.

Answer: You can use [`loadtxt`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/basics.io.html#loading-an-array) to load the data from file into a NumPy array. For example, given the following CSV file:

\begin{code}
1,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z
