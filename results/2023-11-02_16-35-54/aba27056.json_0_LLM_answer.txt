Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The neural net doesn't know anything about patterns; it just has a bunch of weights and biases that are adjusted during training so as to minimize some error function. It can be used for classification or regression problems (or both). If you want to classify your data into two classes, then you need to use a binary target vector in your training set.

Answer: You have to define a loss function which tells the model how good its predictions were. In this case, you could use `binary_crossentropy` with a sigmoid activation at the end of the last layer. This will tell the model if it was right or wrong when predicting a value between 0 and 1.

If you don't care about the exact values but only whether they are above or below a certain threshold, you should use `categorical_crossentropy`.
