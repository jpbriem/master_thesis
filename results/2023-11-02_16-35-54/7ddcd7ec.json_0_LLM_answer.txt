Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error. It might happen that a particular set of weights and biases will result in an accurate prediction for this data, but there are many other sets of weights and biases which would also give good results (and some which don't). You can see this if you run your code multiple times with different random seeds - sometimes it works well, sometimes it doesn't.

I am trying to understand how neural networks work.
\end{blockquote}

You should start from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruquKk) video.

\strong{TLDR:} Neural Networks are inspired by human brain. They have neurons like our brains do. Each neuron has inputs and outputs. Inputs are connected to previous layer's neurons. Outputs are connected to next layer's neurons. There are also bias values. Bias value is added to each neuron's summed inputs. Then activation function is applied on the summed inputs + bias. Activation functions are used to make non-linear decision boundaries.

In your case, you have 2 hidden layers. So, first hidden layer's neurons are connected to inputs. Second hidden layer's neurons are connected to first hidden layer's neurons. And lastly, output layer's neurons are connected to second hidden layer's neurons.

\section{How does training process work?}

Training process is basically finding best weights and biases for all neurons. Weights and biases are randomly initialized at the beginning. After initialization, we calculate loss between predicted outputs and real outputs. If loss is high, then we update weights and biases using gradient descent algorithm. Gradient Descent Algorithm finds optimal weights and biases by updating them according to their derivatives.

\section{Why did my model fail?}

Your model failed because you didn't use enough epochs or learning rate was too low. Increase number of epochs or decrease learning rate until you get desired accuracy.
