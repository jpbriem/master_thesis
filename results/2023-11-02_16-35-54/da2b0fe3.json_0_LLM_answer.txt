Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error. It can be used for classification (i.e., recognizing a pattern), but that's only one possible use case.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to understand how neural networks work and I have been reading some tutorials on the internet. However, they all seem to assume that the reader already knows something about neural networks or machine learning in general.
\end{blockquote}

This is because there are many different types of neural nets with different architectures and training algorithms. There is no single tutorial which covers them all. You need to pick one type of net and learn about it first before moving onto another type.

\begin{blockquote}

The problem is that I don't really get how the network learns from the examples given during the training phase.
\end{blockquote}

It depends on the architecture and algorithm. For instance, backpropagation uses gradient descent to find the weights which minimise the error between the desired outputs and actual outputs. This is done using calculus. Other algorithms such as Hebbian Learning do not require any maths at all.

\begin{blockquote}

For example, if we want to teach our network to recognize a certain pattern, how does it actually learn? Does it try every combination of weights until it finds the right ones? Or does it somehow calculate the best weight values based on the data provided?
\end{blockquote}

Again, this depends on the architecture and algorithm. Backpropagation will adjust each weight individually until the error is minimised. Hebbian Learning will simply increase the strength of connections which were active when an input was presented.

\strong{Update:}

You asked me to explain backpropagation so here goes...

Backpropagation is a method of finding the optimal weights for a feed-forward neural network. A feed-forward neural network has multiple layers where each layer consists of several neurons. Each neuron receives inputs from the previous layer and sends outputs to the next layer. The final layer contains the output neurons whose activation levels represent the predicted class label(s).

In order to determine whether the network has correctly classified an image, we compare the predicted labels against the true labels. If the two sets match then the prediction is correct. Otherwise, the prediction is incorrect. We call this the \em{error}.

We would like to reduce the error as much as possible. To achieve this, we must change the weights connecting each pair of neurons. But how should these changes be made? Well, let's consider a simple scenario involving three neurons: `A`, `B` and `C`. Suppose `A` is connected to both `B` and `C` via two separate paths. Also suppose that `B` is connected to `D` while `C` is connected to `E`. Finally, suppose that `D` and `E` are both connected to `F`. Now imagine that `F`'s activation level is too high. How could we fix this? One way would be to decrease the weight of the connection between `A` and `B`. Another way would be to decrease the weight of the connection between `C` and `E`. Yet another way would be to decrease the
