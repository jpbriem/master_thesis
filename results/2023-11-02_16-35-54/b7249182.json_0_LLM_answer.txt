Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The neural net doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It can be used for classification (e.g., recognizing digits), but that's a different problem from finding patterns in data.

Answer: You are correct that this is an overfitting issue. Your training set is too small and your model is too complex.

The first thing you should do is increase the size of your training set. If you have access to more data, use it! Otherwise, try using [data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation) techniques like random cropping or flips to artificially create new examples from your existing ones.

Next, simplify your model. Try reducing the number of layers or neurons until you find a configuration that generalizes well on unseen data. This may require some trial-and-error, so don't be afraid to experiment with different architectures.

Finally, make sure you are using appropriate regularization methods such as dropout or L2 penalties during training. These will help prevent your model from learning spurious correlations between inputs and outputs which could lead to poor performance when applied to real world problems.
