Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just tries to minimize its error function. It can be used for classification (i.e., recognizing a pattern), but that's not how it works internally.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}

I am trying to understand why this neural net has such a high accuracy on training data and test data.
\end{blockquote}

It does not have a high accuracy on the training data. You are misreading your own results. Your code prints out the following:

\begin{code}
Training set accuracy: 100%
Testing set accuracy:  93.75%
\end{code}

The first number is the percentage of examples in the training set which were classified correctly. The second number is the percentage of examples in the testing set which were classified correctly.

In other words, the network was able to learn the correct answer for every single one of the training examples, but only got the right answer for nine out of ten of the testing examples. This means that the network did not generalise well from the training data to the testing data.

This is because the network is overfitting the training data. In other words, it is learning the answers to the questions in the training set so well that it cannot apply those same rules to new problems.

You could try using more hidden neurons or fewer layers, or increasing the learning rate, or decreasing the momentum factor, or any combination thereof. But if you want to get better performance than this, you will need to use a different algorithm altogether.
