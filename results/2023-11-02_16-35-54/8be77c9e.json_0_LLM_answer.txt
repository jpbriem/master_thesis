Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two bits are the same". Do you mean that they have the same value? Or do you mean that they are in the same position (i.e., both leftmost or both rightmost)?

Answer: You can use a regular expression to match the pattern and then replace it with your desired string.

For example, if you want to replace all occurrences of `0`s at the beginning of each line with `1`, you could use this regex: `/^0+/g`. This will match any number of `0`s at the start of each line and replace them with `1`.

Similarly, if you want to replace all occurrences of `1`s at the end of each line with `0`, you could use this regex: `/[1]+$/g`. This will match any number of `1`s at the end of each line and replace them with `0`.
