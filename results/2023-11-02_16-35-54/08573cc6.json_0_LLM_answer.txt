Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just learns how to map inputs to outputs based on training data. If your training data has a pattern in it then that will be reflected in the weights learned by the neural net. But if there isn't any pattern (either because none exists or because the training set was too small) then the NN won't learn one.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I am trying to understand why my neural network does not generalize well when tested with new data.
\end{blockquote}

The problem is that you are using a very simple model for a complex task. You have only two hidden neurons and no bias terms. This means that each hidden neuron can represent at most one linear function. In other words, the hidden layer can represent at most two linear functions. However, this task requires more than two linear functions. For instance, consider the following test case:

\begin{code}
input: [4, 7]
output: [9, 9]
\end{code}

This test case cannot be represented by any combination of two linear functions. Therefore, your model cannot learn to solve this task.

To fix this problem, you need to use a larger number of hidden neurons. A good rule of thumb is to use at least as many hidden neurons as there are input features. So, in this case, you should use at least three hidden neurons.
