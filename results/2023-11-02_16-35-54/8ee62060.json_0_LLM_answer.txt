Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the network is trained to recognize the pattern". The network doesn't know anything about patterns; it just learns how to map inputs to outputs. It can be used for classification (i.e., mapping an input vector to a class), but that's not really relevant here.

Answer: You are correct in your assumption that the neural network will learn to solve this problem if given enough training data and time. However, there are some things you should consider before implementing such a solution.

Firstly, as you have already noticed, the amount of training data required to achieve good results may be very large. This is because the number of possible combinations of numbers on the grid is extremely high - even with only 4 digits per row/column, there are over 65 thousand different possibilities! As a result, it would take a long time to generate all these examples manually.

Secondly, while it is true that neural networks can learn from any kind of data, they do require some sort of structure or organization in order to make sense out of them. In other words, simply feeding raw images into a neural network won't work unless those images contain some form of meaningful information which can help guide the learning process. For instance, if we were trying to teach our NN how to identify objects within an image using supervised learning methods like backpropagation then we would need labeled datasets containing both positive (images containing desired object) and negative (images NOT containing desired object) samples so that our model could differentiate between them during training phase itself. Similarly, when dealing with unsupervised problems like Sudoku puzzles where no labels exist at all, one needs additional sources / hints regarding what constitutes valid solutions otherwise its impossible for machine algorithms alone figure out optimal strategies without human intervention.

Finally, although deep learning has been successfully applied towards solving various types complex tasks including games like Go & Chess etc..it still remains relatively new field compared traditional AI approaches based upon handcrafted rulesets developed through years research efforts conducted by experts working across
