Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the first two numbers are the same". Do you mean that they have the same value? Or do you mean that they appear in the same position (i.e., the first number is always the first element and the second number is always the second element)?

\begin{code}
(+/)@.(>./.)&.>

This takes a list of lists as input, and returns a list of lists with the same structure but with the elements rearranged according to the rules given in the question.

The code works by taking each sublist and sorting its elements into ascending order, then reversing them so that the largest comes first. It does this using `>(>./.)` which sorts the elements of each sublist in descending order, then uses `(+/)@.` to reverse the result. The final `&>` flattens the resulting list of lists back down to a single list.
