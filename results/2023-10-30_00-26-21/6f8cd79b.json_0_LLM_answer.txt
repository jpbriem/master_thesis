Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code is correct and it does exactly as expected. What do you expect?

Comment: @SvenMarnach I think he means that the results are different from his own implementation.

Answer: Your code looks fine to me. It seems like your problem might be in how you're testing it. For instance, if you have a `main` function which calls `run_tests`, then you can just run `python -m unittest` (or whatever command you use for running tests) instead of calling `unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite)`.

If you want to see the actual output of each test, you could also add a `print` statement inside the `assertEqual` call.
