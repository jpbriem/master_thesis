Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are different in that the second one has a `0` at index 4 instead of an `8`.

Comment: @user253751 yes, but they have the same number of zeros and ones.

Answer: You can use [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to measure how similar two strings are. It is defined as follows:

$$d(x,y)=\min_{f}\sum_{i=0}^{|x|-1}|x[i]-y[f(i)]|+|f(i)-f(i+1)|$$

where $f$ ranges over all possible functions from $[0,\dots,|x|]$ to $[0,\dots,|y|]$.

For your problem, we can define $x$ as the string representing the training data, and $y$ as the string representing the testing data. Then, if $d(x,y)$ is small, then the two sets of data are very similar.
