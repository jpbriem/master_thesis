End of test.

Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same result". The code in your question is different from the code in your comment. In particular, it doesn't use `std::vector<int>`.

Comment: @TobySpeight Sorry for that, I edited my post to make it more clear.

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
I have a problem with this code and I don't know why.
\end{blockquote}

The problem is that you are using `std::vector` incorrectly. You need to pass an iterator into `sort`, but you are passing a pointer instead. This means that the sort will be done on the memory pointed at by the pointer, which may or may not be valid.

You can fix this by changing the line

\begin{code}
sort(v.begin(), v.end());
\end{code}

to

\begin{code}
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](const int& i, const int& j) { return i < j; });
\end{code}
