Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same as the training set". The training set is a collection of examples that are used to learn the model. Once learning has finished, it should be discarded and never used again. You can use the trained model on any new data (i.e., unseen data) to make predictions.

I am confused about how to evaluate my neural network after training.
\end{blockquote}

You don't need to do anything special for evaluation. Just feed your trained model with some data and see if it makes correct predictions. For example, let's say you have a binary classification problem where you want to predict whether an image contains a cat or not. After training, you could take a random image from the internet and pass it through your model to get its prediction. If the predicted label matches the actual label, then your model works correctly.
