Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are different from each other and the third is different from both of them.

Comment: @DavidHammen I meant that they all have the same number of classes (in this case 2) but different numbers of features.

Answer: You can use a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning). A decision tree is an algorithm for learning if-then rules. It works like this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with one node representing the entire dataset.
\item For each feature in your data, split the nodes into subnodes based on whether or not the value of the feature is true.
\item Repeat step 2 until there are no more splits to be made.
\item Each leaf node represents a rule.
\end{itemize}

For example, suppose we want to classify people as either male or female. We could start with a single node representing the whole population. Then we would split it into two nodes depending on whether or not the person has a Y chromosome. If so, then the person is male; otherwise, the person is female. This gives us our first rule:

We continue splitting the nodes until we reach leaves. In this case, we don't need any further splits because everyone who has a Y chromosome is male, and everyone else is female. So our final set of rules looks like this:

<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J567e.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><IMAGE></a>

You can see how these rules work by applying them to some new data. Suppose we have a new person whose sex is unknown. We apply the first rule to determine that he does not have a Y chromosome. Therefore, he must be female.
