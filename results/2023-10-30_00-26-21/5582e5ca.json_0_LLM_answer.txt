Comment: I'm not sure what you mean by "the same". The first two examples are the same, but they have different outputs.

Comment: @user253751 yes, that is correct. But if we look at the last three lines in each case, it can be seen that the output is always the same for a given input. So, there is no need to store the output for each training sample.

Answer: You could use a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) (or any other data structure with O(1) lookup time).

For example, you could create an array `outputs` and fill it with all possible combinations of inputs. Then, when you get a new input, just check whether this combination has already been stored in your hash table. If so, return its corresponding output; otherwise, add the current input-output pair to the hash table and return the default value.
