LLM answer for tasks 1:
7, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 8, 8
7, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 8
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4
6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4
6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
3, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 9
3, 3, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 9, 9
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same set of outputs when run through the neural network. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize patterns in the data that allow it to make accurate predictions even when given new, unseen data (in this case, the test inputs).
