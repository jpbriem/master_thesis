End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are different from each other. The training data contains more examples with a higher number of correct outputs (8), while the test data has fewer examples with less correct outputs (0). This is because the model was trained on a larger dataset to improve its accuracy, but it may not generalize well to new, unseen data like the test set.
