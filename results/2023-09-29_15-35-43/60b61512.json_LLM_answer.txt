End of example.
As you can see, the model is able to correctly classify all test inputs as either "0" or "4". However, when given a new input (the last one in the test set), it produces an incorrect output of "7", which is not present in the training data. This suggests that the model may be overfitting to the training data and not generalizing well to new, unseen data.
