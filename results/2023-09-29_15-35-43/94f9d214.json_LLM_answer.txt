LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
Note that the last two examples have different outputs than the corresponding training inputs. This is because the model has learned to generalize beyond its training data and can recognize new patterns in the test data.
