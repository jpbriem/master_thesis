LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5
5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5
0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0
5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0
5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but the model is able to predict the correct output for both sets of inputs. This shows that the model has learned the patterns in the data and can generalize well to new examples.
