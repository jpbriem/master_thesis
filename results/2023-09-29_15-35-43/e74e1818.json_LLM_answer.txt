End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are different from each other. The training data contains more examples with a higher number of classes (up to 8), while the test data has fewer examples and only 2 classes. This is done on purpose, as we want the model to be able to generalize well to new, unseen data. If the model was trained on very similar data to what it will encounter in real-world scenarios, it might not perform well when faced with novel inputs. By providing the model with a mix of easy and hard examples during training, we can improve its ability to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions on new data.
