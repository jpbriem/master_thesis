Note that the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as arrays of integers, with each integer representing a feature in the input data (either 0 or 1). The `train` output is also an array of integers, representing the predicted class labels for the training examples. Similarly, the `test` output is an array of integers, representing the actual class labels for the test examples.
