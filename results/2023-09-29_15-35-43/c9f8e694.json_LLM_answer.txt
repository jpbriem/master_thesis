End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are quite different from each other. The training data contains mostly 5's and a few 0's, while the test data contains mostly 0's and a few 5's. This is because the training data was generated using a random process that produced mostly 5's, while the test data was generated using a different random process that produced mostly 0's.
The output of the neural network for both the training and test data is also quite different. For the training data, the output is mostly 0's, indicating that the network has learned to recognize most of the inputs as not belonging to any class. For the test data, the output is mostly 1's, indicating that the network has learned to recognize most of the inputs as belonging to class 1.
This demonstrates one of the key advantages of neural networks: they can learn to recognize patterns in complex data, even when the training and test data are quite different from each other.
