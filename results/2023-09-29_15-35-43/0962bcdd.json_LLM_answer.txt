As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize the patterns in the training data, and it's able to generalize those patterns to new, unseen data (like the test data).

In this case, the neural network has learned to recognize the binary classification problem, where the input features are used to predict whether the output is 0 or 1. The network has learned that the input features have a certain importance, and it's able to use them to make accurate predictions on new data.
