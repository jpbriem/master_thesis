0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0
0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6
6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6
0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6
6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0
0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 4, 6, 4, 0
End of example.
Note that the last two examples are more complex than the first four, as they involve multiple inputs and outputs for each sample in the training set.
