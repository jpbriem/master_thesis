LLM answer for tasks 1:
2, 2, 7, 2
2, 2, 7, 7
7, 7, 2, 7
End of example.
Note that the training examples are generated by randomly permuting the values in the given input vector, and then adding noise to the resulting vector according to a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of $\sigma$. The test examples are also generated using random permutations and additive noise, but without any further processing or normalization.
