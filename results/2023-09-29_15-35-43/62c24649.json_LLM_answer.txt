LLM answer for tasks 1:
1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1
0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0
3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 6). Each subsequent line specifies a single example, with each number representing the value of a particular feature for that example. For example, in the first example, the values of the features for the input are `3`, `3`, `3`, and so on. The corresponding outputs are also given on the next line.

In contrast, the `test` file contains only three lines, which correspond to the test data. As before, each line specifies a single example, with each number representing the value of a particular feature for that example.

Note that the numbers in both files are integers, but they do not necessarily represent numerical values. Instead, they may represent categorical or binary values, as is often the case in text classification tasks.
