LLM answer for tasks 1:
9, 1, 2, 8, 4, 9, 8, 2, 1
4, 4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 6, 7, 9
2, 1, 6, 9, 7, 8, 4, 3, 6
9, 8, 6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1, 7
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
Note that the test set contains only a subset of the training examples, and is used to evaluate how well the trained model can generalize to new, unseen data.
