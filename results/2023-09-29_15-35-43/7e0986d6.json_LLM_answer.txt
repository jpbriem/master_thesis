End of example.
As you can see, the training data is much simpler than the test data. The training data consists only of simple patterns like "0" or "5", while the test data contains more complex patterns with multiple digits and non-digits. This means that the model will have an easier time learning from the training data and making accurate predictions on it, but it may struggle to generalize well to the more complex test data.
