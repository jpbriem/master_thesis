End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are both binary classification problems, where each sample is labeled with a class (either 0 or 1). The model is trained on the training data to predict the correct class for each sample, and then tested on the test data to evaluate its performance. In this case, the model is able to correctly classify all of the samples in both the training and test sets, indicating that it has learned the underlying pattern in the data.
