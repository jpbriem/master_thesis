End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors with length 8, and the output is also a binary vector with length 8. The model is trained to predict the output based on the input. In this case, the model is able to correctly classify the input data into one of two classes (0 or 1) with high accuracy.

It's important to note that the above examples are just simple demonstrations of how a neural network can be used for classification tasks. In real-world applications, the data used to train the model will likely be much larger and more complex, and the model may need to be adjusted and fine-tuned to achieve good performance. Additionally, there are many other types of neural networks that can be used for classification, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which may be better suited to certain types of data.
