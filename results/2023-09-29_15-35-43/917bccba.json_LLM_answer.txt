End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are different from each other. The training data contains more examples with a higher number of correct predictions (i.e., values close to 1), while the test data has fewer examples with lower numbers of correct predictions (i.e., values closer to 0). This is because the training data was used to fit the model, while the test data was used to evaluate its performance.
