LLM answer for tasks 1:
4, 4, 9, 9
4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 9, 9
4, 4, 9, 9
4, 4, 4, 4
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set, which is 8 in this case. Each subsequent line specifies a single example, with each value separated by a space. The values are represented as integers between 0 and 9 inclusive.

For example, the first example has inputs `9`, `9`, `5`, and `9`, and outputs `9`, `5`, `9`, and `9`. Similarly, the second example has inputs `4`, `1`, `1`, and `4`, and outputs `4`, `4`, `4`, and `1`.

The `test` file contains a single example with inputs `4`, `4`, `9`, and `9`, and an expected output of `4`, `4`, `9`, and `9`.
