0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0
0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but the model is able to predict correctly for both sets of inputs. This shows that the model has learned generalizable features and patterns from the training data, which it can use to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data (in this case, the test data).
