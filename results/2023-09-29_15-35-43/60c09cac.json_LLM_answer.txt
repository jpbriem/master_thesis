In this example, the training data consists of eight inputs and their corresponding outputs. The first four inputs are `0`, `3`, `0`, and `7`, respectively, and the corresponding outputs are also `0`. The second set of four inputs is `0`, `7`, `7`, and `7`, respectively, and the corresponding outputs are also `7`. The last two inputs are `0` and `0`, respectively, and the corresponding outputs are also `0`.

The test data consists of five inputs and their corresponding outputs. The first input is `0`, `0`, `1`, and `0`, respectively, and the corresponding output is also `0`. The second input is `0`, `0`, `1`, and `6`, respectively, and the corresponding output is also `0`. The remaining three inputs are `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, and `0`, respectively, and the corresponding outputs are also `0`.

As you can see from the examples above, the neural network has learned to recognize patterns in the data and make accurate predictions based on those patterns. In this case, the pattern it has learned is that when the input is `0`, the output should be `0`, and when the input is non-zero, the output should be equal to the value of the input multiplied by a constant (in this case, `3`).
