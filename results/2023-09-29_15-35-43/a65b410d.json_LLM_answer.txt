3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
Note that the last two examples have different inputs and outputs than the previous ones, indicating that the model is able to generalize well to new data.
