LLM answer for tasks 1:
2
End of example.
\end{code}

As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output (i.e., `2`). This is because the neural network has learned to recognize the pattern in the training data, and it is able to generalize that pattern to new, unseen data (i.e., the test data).

In this example, the neural network has learned to recognize the pattern of a binary classification problem, where the input features are `0` or `1`, and the output is either `0` or `1`. The network has learned to use the input features to make predictions about the output, and it has achieved an accuracy of `90%` on the training data.
