End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are identical in this example, but the model still manages to correctly classify the inputs as either "2" or "8". This is because the model is trained on a large dataset of examples, and it has learned to recognize patterns in the data that allow it to make accurate predictions even when the training and test data are not exactly the same.
