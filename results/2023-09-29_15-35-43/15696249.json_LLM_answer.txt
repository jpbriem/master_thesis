The first column of the `train` dataset contains the input values for each row in the training set, and the second column contains the corresponding output values. The same format is used for both the `train` and `test` datasets.

For example, in the first row of the `train` dataset, the input value is `4`, which corresponds to the fourth element in the input vector `4, 4, 6`. The output value is `0`, indicating that the model predicted a zero-valued label for this input. Similarly, in the second row of the `train` dataset, the input value is `3`, which corresponds to the third element in the input vector `3, 3, 3`. The output value is `0`, indicating that the model predicted a zero-valued label for this input as well.

Similarly, in the `test` dataset, the input values are `6, 6, 3`, `4, 4, 3`, and `4, 4, 3`, respectively, and the corresponding output values are `0`, `0`, and `0`, respectively. These output values indicate that the model correctly predicted a zero-valued label for each input in the test set.
