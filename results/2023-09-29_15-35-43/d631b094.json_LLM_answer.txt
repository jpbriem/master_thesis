The first column represents the number of inputs (0 or 1), the second column represents the number of hidden units in the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the third column represents the number of outputs. The examples are generated by a simple RNN with one hidden layer, where each input is fed into the RNN and the output is predicted based on the previous inputs.
