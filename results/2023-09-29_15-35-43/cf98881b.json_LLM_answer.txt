LLM answer for tasks 1:
4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 0, 0
4, 1, 4, 4
1, 4, 4, 4
End of example.
Note that the last two examples are more complex than the previous ones and demonstrate some of the capabilities of the algorithm. In particular, they show how the algorithm can handle inputs with multiple "holes" (i.e., regions where there are no obstacles) and how it can handle inputs with non-uniformly distributed obstacles.
