LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 0, 0
8, 8, 8
0, 0, 0
End of example.
Note that the examples are generated using a simple neural network with one hidden layer containing 8 neurons and a sigmoid activation function. The training data consists of 10 examples per class (i.e., 10 inputs and corresponding outputs for each of the three classes).
