LLM answer for tasks 1:
5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0
3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0
2, 0, 8, 8, 5, 0
2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5
End of example.
Note that the test set contains more examples than the training set because we want to demonstrate how the model can generalize to new inputs it has not seen before.
