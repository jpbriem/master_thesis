End of example.
As you can see, the training and test sets are identical in this case, but that is not always the case in real-world scenarios. The goal of preprocessing is to transform the data into a format that can be used by the machine learning algorithm, while preserving the important features of the data. In this case, we have simply scaled the values of each feature to be between 0 and 1, which is a common preprocessing step for image classification tasks. However, other preprocessing steps may be necessary depending on the specific characteristics of the data.
