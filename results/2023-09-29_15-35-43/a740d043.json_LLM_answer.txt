LLM answer for tasks 1:
2, 2
2, 2
3, 3
End of example.
Note that the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same outputs when run through the neural network. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize patterns in the data during the training process, and it can apply those patterns to new inputs (like the test inputs) to make predictions.
