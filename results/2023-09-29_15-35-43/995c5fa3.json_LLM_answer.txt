LLM answer for tasks 1:
1, 1, 1
4, 4, 4
2, 2, 2
End of example.
Note that the training and test inputs are different from each other, but they both produce the same output for a given set of inputs. This is because the neural network has learned to recognize patterns in the data during the training process, and it can use this knowledge to make predictions on new, unseen data (in this case, the test inputs).
