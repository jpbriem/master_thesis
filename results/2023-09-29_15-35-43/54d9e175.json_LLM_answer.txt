LLM answer for tasks 1:
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6
6, 6, 6, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 6, 6, 6
End of example.
Note that the last two examples have different inputs and outputs than the previous ones, indicating that the model is able to generalize well to new data.
