LLM answer for tasks 1:
0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4
6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4
6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 4
End of example.
Note that the training and test inputs are randomized versions of the same set of examples used in the original paper.
