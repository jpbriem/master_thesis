LLM answer for tasks 1:
2, 3, 2
0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0
2, 3, 2
0, 2, 0
0, 2, 0
\end{code}

As you can see, the training examples are `0, 1, 0`, `1, 1, 0`, `0, 1, 0`, and so on. The test examples are `1, 1, 1`, `0, 1, 0`, and so on.

The neural network is trained to predict the output for a given input. In this case, the output is a binary number (0 or 2) that represents whether the input is positive or negative.

To use the neural network to classify new inputs, you would provide it with a set of input values, and it would return the predicted output value based on those inputs. For example, if you provided the neural network with the input `1, 1, 1`, it would return the output `2` because according to the training data, an input of `1, 1, 1` corresponds to an output of `2`.
