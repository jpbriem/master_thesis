0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
End of example.
\end{code}

As you can see, the training and test inputs are all binary vectors with length 8, and the corresponding outputs are also binary vectors with length 8. The training set consists of 16 examples, each consisting of an input vector and its corresponding output vector. The test set consists of 4 examples, each consisting of an input vector and its corresponding output vector.
