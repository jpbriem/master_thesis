0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0
0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3
0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3
0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 3
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but the model is able to predict correctly for both sets of data. This shows that the model has learned generalizable features that can be used to classify new examples.
