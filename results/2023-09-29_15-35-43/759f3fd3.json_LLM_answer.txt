4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the model is able to predict the correct output for each test input, and the predicted outputs are all 4s. This means that the model has learned the patterns in the data and is able to generalize well to new inputs.
