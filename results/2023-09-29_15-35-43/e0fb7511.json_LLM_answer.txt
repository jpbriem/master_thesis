1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are very similar to each other, but there are some differences in the values of the input features. This is because the training data contains more examples than the test data, and also because the training data has a different distribution of values for certain features (such as the first feature).
The output of the model on both the training and test data is also very similar, with most of the outputs being close to 1 or -1. This indicates that the model is able to learn the underlying patterns in the data and make accurate predictions on both the training and test data.
