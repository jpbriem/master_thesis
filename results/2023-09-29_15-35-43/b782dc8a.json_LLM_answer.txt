End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are both binary classification problems, where each sample is labeled as either "positive" or "negative". The model is trained on the training data to predict the label for a given input, and then tested on the test data to evaluate its performance. In this case, the model was able to correctly classify all of the samples in the training set, and also performed well on the test set.
