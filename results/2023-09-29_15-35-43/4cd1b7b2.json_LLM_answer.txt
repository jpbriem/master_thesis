LLM answer for tasks 1:
1, 2, 3, 4
0, 1, 2, 0
3, 0, 4, 1
0, 4, 2, 3
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of samples in the training set (4). Each subsequent line specifies a single sample, with each digit representing the value of one of the four variables (X1, X2, X3, or X4) for that sample. The corresponding values are given on the next line, separated by spaces. For example, the first two lines might read:
```
4
1 0 3 4
```
which means that the first sample has X1 = 1, X2 = 0, X3 = 3, and X4 = 4.

The `test` file is similar to the `train` file, but it contains only five samples instead of 4, and the values of the variables are different from those in the training set.

Your task is to write a program that can predict the values of the variables in the test set based on the patterns learned from the training data. You may use any machine learning algorithm you like, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

Here's an example of how you could implement this using Python and scikit-learn library:
```
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data[:, :2]  # we only take the first two features.
y = iris.target

# Train/Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the performance of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
This code will load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train a linear regression model on the training set, and make predictions on the testing set. It will then evaluate the performance of the model using the accuracy score.

You can modify this code to suit your needs, such as changing the machine learning algorithm, adjusting the hyperparameters, or adding more features to the dataset.
