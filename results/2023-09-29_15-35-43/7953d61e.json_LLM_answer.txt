LLM answer for tasks 1:
4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
4, 6, 4, 4, 7, 6, 7, 9
7, 6, 7, 9, 9, 4, 9, 7
9, 4, 9, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9
End of example.
Note that the examples are generated using a simple algorithm that takes as input a sequence of integers and outputs a corresponding sequence of integers. The algorithm starts by initializing an empty list, and then iteratively adds to the list each integer in the input sequence that is not already present in the list. Once all integers from the input sequence have been added to the list, the algorithm terminates and returns the list as the output.
