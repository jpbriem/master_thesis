LLM answer for tasks 1:
3, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
8, 4, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0
8, 9, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
End of example.
As you can see, the training and test inputs are different from each other, but the model is able to predict correctly for both sets of data.
