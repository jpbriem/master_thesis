End of example.
As you can see, the training and test data are both binary classification problems, where the target variable is either 0 or 1. The training data consists of 8 examples per class (4 positive and 4 negative), while the test data has only 2 examples per class (1 positive and 1 negative).
The model is trained using the `fit()` method, which takes in the training data as an argument. In this case, we're using a simple linear regression model, so the `fit()` method will optimize the parameters of the linear regression equation to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted values and the actual values.
Once the model is trained, we can use the `predict()` method to make predictions on new data. In this case, we're using the test data to evaluate how well the model performs.
Here are some key takeaways from this example:
* Binary classification problems can be challenging because there are only two classes to distinguish.
* Even with a small number of examples per class, it's possible to train a model that can accurately predict the target variable.
* Linear regression models can be effective for binary classification problems when the relationship between the features and the target variable is not too complex.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
