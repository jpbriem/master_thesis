As you can see, the `train` and `test` inputs are represented as lists of numbers, while the `train` and `test` outputs are also represented as lists of numbers, but with additional information such as class labels.

The first column of each list represents the input data, which in this case is a sequence of 0s and 1s representing the presence or absence of certain features in the input data. The remaining columns represent the output data, which in this case is a classification of the input data into one of two classes based on the presence or absence of certain features.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
