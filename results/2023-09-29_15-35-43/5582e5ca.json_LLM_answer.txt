LLM answer for tasks 1:
8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8
End of example.

The first line of the `train` file contains the number of examples in the training set (in this case, 3). Each subsequent line specifies a single example in the format `(input features) (output)`. The `input features` are separated by spaces and consist of integers or floating-point numbers. The `output` is also a sequence of integers or floating-point numbers, but it has the same length as the `input features`.

For example, in the first example, the input features for the first example are `4, 4, 8`, which means that the neural network should expect three inputs with values `4`, `4`, and `8`, respectively. Similarly, the output for the first example is `4, 4, 4`, which means that the neural network should produce an output of `4` for each of the three inputs.

Similarly, in the second example, the input features for the second example are `6, 8, 9`, which means that the neural network should expect three inputs with values `6`, `8`, and `9`, respectively. And so on.

The `test` file works similarly, but instead of containing examples from the training set, it contains examples that were not seen during training and are used to evaluate how well the trained model can generalize to new data.
