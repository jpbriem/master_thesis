prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 8, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 7, 2, 6, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 0], [8, 0, 1, 4, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In Example 1, there are no changes in pixel values between the input and output grids. However, there is an increase in the number of black pixels (from 4 to 6) due to the presence of new objects.', 'object_changes': 'In Example 1, there are two additional objects created in the output grid compared to the input grid. Object 1 is composed of three black pixels arranged in a line, while Object 2 is composed of four black pixels arranged in a square. Both objects are located at coordinates [0,1] and [1,1].'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In Example 2, there are no changes in pixel values between the input and output grids. However, there is a decrease in the number of white pixels (from 4 to 2) due to the disappearance of one object.', 'object_changes': 'In Example 2, there is one fewer object created in the output grid compared to the input grid. Object 1 has been merged with Object 2 to form a larger object that occupies more space.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The underlying transformation pattern for these examples involves creating new objects based on the input grid. Each new object consists of a set of pixels that share a common color value. The positions of the new objects relative to each other may change depending on the specific rules governing their creation.'}

{'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]',
'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'No changes in pixel values between input and output grids.',

```

This code creates a dictionary containing the description of the examples provided, including information about the changes in pixel values, object numbers, coordinates, sizes, and shapes. It also includes the overall pattern of the transformation, as well as instructions for performing the transformation step-by-step. Finally, it outputs the original input grid and the transformed output grid as numpy arrays.
