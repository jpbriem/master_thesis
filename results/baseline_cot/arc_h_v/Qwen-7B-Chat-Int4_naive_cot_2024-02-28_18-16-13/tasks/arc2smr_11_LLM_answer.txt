prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given examples show that there is a pattern where certain objects (in this case, connected groups of five pixels) appear rotated and/or translated along the x-axis compared to their original position. This pattern is present across multiple inputs, suggesting it is a fundamental aspect of the transformation process.
To create the output grid, we need to apply the rotation and translation to each group of five pixels, while maintaining the connectivity of these groups. We can do this using matrix multiplication to rotate the pixels around the center of the group, and then translating them along the x-axis by the appropriate amount. For example, if an object has been translated by 3 units to the right, we would multiply the matrix by a 3x3 matrix with -1s in the bottom-right corner and 1s elsewhere. If an object has been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, we would multiply the matrix by a 3x3 matrix with -1s in the top-left and bottom-right corners and 1s elsewhere.
Once we have applied the rotation and translation to each group of five pixels, we can combine the resulting matrices to obtain the final output grid. This will involve adding the corresponding elements of the two matrices together, taking care to handle any negative numbers appropriately.
Overall, the transformation pattern involves applying a combination of rotation and translation to objects in order to move them to new positions and orientations. To implement this pattern, we need to use matrix multiplication to perform these operations on the input grid, and then combine the results to obtain the output grid.
