prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern where each object's size is changed by adding or removing one pixel in a specific direction (either horizontally or vertically). 

For Example_1, we see that the first object has been shifted horizontally by two pixels, while the second object has been shifted vertically by three pixels. In Example_2, we see that the first object has been shifted horizontally by four pixels, while the second object has been shifted vertically by five pixels. In Example_3, we see that the first object has been shifted horizontally by six pixels, while the second object has been shifted vertically by seven pixels.

Overall Pattern:

The overall pattern involves shifting objects horizontally or vertically by a certain amount. This pattern is applied repeatedly to the input grid until no more shifts are possible.

Instructions:

To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to shift each object horizontally or vertically by the appropriate amount. You can do this by accessing the object's coordinates and changing them accordingly. For example, if an object is located at coordinates (x,y), then after shifting it horizontally by one pixel, its new coordinates would be (x+1,y).

Transformed Input Grid:

[[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]]

Transformed Output Grid:

[[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Note that the transformed output grid may contain some additional zeros that were added to maintain the same total number of pixels as in the original grid. These extra zeros do not affect the overall pattern of the transformation.
