prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern:

The overall pattern shared among the input-output pairs is that each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a pixel in the output grid, but their values may differ. Specifically, an object in the input grid will be transformed into another object (or several objects) in the output grid. The transformation involves changing the value of the pixels to create new objects, while preserving the boundaries of existing objects. Additionally, some pixels may remain unchanged, indicating that they do not correspond to any object in the input grid.

Instructions:

To transform the test input grid into its corresponding output grid, follow these steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid based on their color and shape. Each object is represented by a set of connected pixels with the same color and shape.
2. For each object, determine its position in the input grid and its size.
3. Create a copy of the input grid that preserves the positions and sizes of the identified objects.
4. For each pixel in the copied grid, compute its corresponding position in the output grid based on the transformation rules.
5. Set the value of the output grid pixel to the appropriate color based on the object it belongs to.

Transformations:

The transformations involved in this problem include translation, rotation, scaling, and mirroring. Translation involves moving the object in the input grid to a new location in the output grid without changing its size or shape. Rotation involves rotating the object around its center point by a certain angle. Scaling involves increasing or decreasing the size of the object while maintaining its aspect ratio. Mirroring involves reflecting the object across a line passing through its center point.

Objects:

In the input grid, objects are represented by sets of connected pixels with the same color and shape. In the output grid, objects are also represented by sets of connected pixels with the same color and shape, but their positions and sizes may change.

Objects and Shapes:

Objects in the input grid can be squares, rectangles, circles, or other polygons. In the output grid, objects may also be squares, rectangles, circles, or other polygons, depending on the specific transformation applied.

Objects and Colors:

Objects in the input grid can have any color, including black, white, gray, blue, green, yellow, red, purple, brown, etc. In the output grid, the color of an object depends on the specific transformation applied.

Overall Test Case Input:

Here's the input grid for the given test case:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6],
 [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
 [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```


And here's the expected output grid:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
