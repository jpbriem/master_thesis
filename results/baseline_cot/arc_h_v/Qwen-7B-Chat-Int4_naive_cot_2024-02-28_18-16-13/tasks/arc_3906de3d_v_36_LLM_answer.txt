prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
To understand the input-output pattern, we need to look at each pair of input and output images. Each pair shows two images side-by-side. The first image is an input grid, while the second image is the corresponding output grid after applying some transformation. We will now analyze these pairs to identify commonalities and differences.

Example 1:

Input grid:

```
[[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output grid:

```
[[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Observation:

Both the input and output grids consist of 10 identical rows and columns of 9 black squares (represented by `9`) and one white square (represented by `0`). The only difference between them is that the third row has three black squares instead of four. This indicates that the transformation applied to the input grid changed the height of the third row.

Therefore, the transformation applied to this pair was a vertical scaling operation that increased the height of the third row by one unit.

Example 2:

Input grid:

```
[[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output grid:

```
[[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Observation:

Both the input and output grids consist of 10 identical rows and columns of 9 black squares (represented by `9`) and one white square (represented by `0`). However, the fourth column has two white squares instead of one. This indicates that the transformation applied to the input grid changed the width of the fourth column by one unit.

Therefore, the transformation applied to this pair was a horizontal scaling operation that increased the width of the fourth column by one unit.

Example 3:

Input grid:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output grid:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9,
