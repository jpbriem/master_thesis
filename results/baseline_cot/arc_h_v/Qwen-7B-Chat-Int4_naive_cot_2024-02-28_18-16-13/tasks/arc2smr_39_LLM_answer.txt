prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
The given examples demonstrate two distinct types of transformations:

  * Example 1 involves a geometric transformation that moves each object (represented as a set of connected pixels) along a certain direction. In this case, the input grid has four objects, and the output grid shows the objects moved along a specific path.
  * Example 2 involves an arithmetic transformation where the value of each pixel is changed according to a mathematical formula. In this case, the input grid has four objects, but the output grid shows the objects transformed by applying the same mathematical operation to every pixel.

To solve the problem, we need to understand the underlying transformation pattern and apply it consistently to the input grid. We can do this by breaking down the input grid into smaller sub-grids and analyzing their properties. For instance, if the transformation involves moving objects, we can identify the starting point and ending point of each object, and then move them accordingly. If the transformation involves changing pixel values, we can identify the rules used to calculate the new values and apply them to every pixel in the grid.

Once we understand the transformation pattern, we can create the corresponding output grid using the appropriate algorithm. This may involve iterating over each pixel in the input grid and performing the necessary operations to generate the corresponding output pixel.

Overall, the solution requires a combination of understanding the underlying transformation pattern and implementing the corresponding algorithm. By doing so, we can create accurate outputs for any given input grid.
