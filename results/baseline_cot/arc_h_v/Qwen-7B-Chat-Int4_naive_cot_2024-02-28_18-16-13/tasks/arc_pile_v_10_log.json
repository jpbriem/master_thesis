            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 4, 1, 3, 2, 7]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 8, 7, 0], [0, 6, 8, 7, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 9, 8, 4], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe input-output pairs provided demonstrate a common pattern where certain regions of the input grid are translated along a specific direction. In each example, there is an initial grid that has some objects (represented by colored regions) and a final grid that has the same objects but shifted in a particular direction. This pattern could be described as translation.\nTo apply this pattern to the given test case, we would need to shift the objects in the input grid in the vertical direction. For example, if we start with the top row of the input grid, we would shift it downward by one position to create the corresponding rows in the output grid. We would also adjust the positions of any objects that overlap with the new rows.\nAfter applying this pattern, the resulting output grid would look like this:\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 3, 2, 0, 0],\n [7, 3, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n\nTherefore, the transformation applied to the test case is translation in the vertical direction. The resulting output grid can be created using the `numpy` library in Python as follows:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = np.array([[7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                       [7, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0],\n                       [0, 3, 0, 9, 8, 4],\n                       [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                       [7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]])\n\n# Shift the objects in the input grid vertically\nshifted_grid = np.roll(input_grid, -1, axis=0)\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = np.zeros_like(shifted_grid)\nfor i in range(len(output_grid)):\n    for j in range(len(output_grid[i])):\n        if shifted_grid[i][j] != 0:\n            output_grid[i][j] = shifted_grid[i][j]\n\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis will produce the output grid shown above."
