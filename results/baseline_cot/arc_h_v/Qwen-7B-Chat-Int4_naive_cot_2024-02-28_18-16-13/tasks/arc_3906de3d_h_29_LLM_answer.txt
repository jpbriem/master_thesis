prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to identify a common pattern among the given input/output pairs that describes how objects move and change over time. Once identified, we can create an algorithm that transforms the input grid into the corresponding output grid based on this pattern.
One possible solution to this problem is to recognize that the input/output pairs consist of objects that undergo a sequence of operations, such as rotation, translation, and mirroring. These operations are applied to individual objects within the grid, and the final result is a new grid where each object has been transformed according to these operations.
To implement this solution, we would follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input grid: We can do this by searching for connected regions of pixels that have the same value (in this case, either 0 or 2). These regions correspond to individual objects.
  2. Determine the operation(s) to apply to each object: This will depend on the specific input/output pair. For example, if the input grid shows two objects that have been rotated and translated, then the corresponding output grid should show the same objects in the same position but with the same orientation and translation.
  3. Apply the operation(s) to each object: To do this, we can iterate through each object in the input grid and perform the necessary operations. For example, if the operation is rotation, we can rotate the object around its center; if the operation is translation, we can translate the object along the x and y axes.
  4. Update the output grid: After applying the operation(s) to each object, we can update the corresponding cell in the output grid to reflect the transformed object.

Using this approach, we can generate the desired output grid for any given input grid. However, it's important to note that there may be multiple correct solutions depending on the specific input/output pairs and the desired level of generality.
Here's an example implementation in Python:
```python
def transform(input_grid):
    # Step 1: Identify the objects in the input grid
    objects = find_objects(input_grid)

    # Step 2: Determine the operation(s) to apply to each object
    operations = []
    for obj in objects:
        if obj.shape == (6, 6):
            operations.append('rotate')
        elif obj.shape == (8, 8):
            operations.append('translate')

    # Step 3: Apply the operation(s) to each object
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    for i, obj in enumerate(objects):
        op = operations[i]
        if op == 'rotate':
            rot_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(np.pi/2), -np.sin(np.pi/2)], [np.sin(np.pi/2), np.cos(np.pi/2)]])
            offset = np.array([obj[0][0], obj[0][1]])
            output_grid[obj[0][0]:obj[0][0]+6, obj[0][1]:obj[0][1]+6] = np.dot(rot_matrix, output_grid[obj[0][0]:obj[0][0]+6, obj[0][1]:obj[0][1]+6]) + offset
        elif op == 'translate':
            offset = np.array(obj[0][0], obj[0][1])
            output_grid[obj[0][0]:obj[0][0]+6, obj[0][1]:obj[0][1]+6] += offset

    return output_grid

# Example usage
input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
                       [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_grid = transform(input_grid)
print(output_grid)
```

This implementation finds the objects in the input grid using a recursive function called `find_objects`, which searches for connected regions of pixels that have the same value. It then applies the specified operation(s) to each object using a loop, updating the corresponding cells in the output grid. Finally, it returns the updated output grid.
