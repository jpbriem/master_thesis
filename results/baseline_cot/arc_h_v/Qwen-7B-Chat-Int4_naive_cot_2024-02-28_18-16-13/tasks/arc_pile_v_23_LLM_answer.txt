prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 1]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 3, 0, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 1], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[3, 9, 5, 0], [3, 0, 5, 2], [3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 9, 5, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, the input grid has 0s where the output grid does not. In the output grid, each row and column contains 0s, except for the middle two rows that contain 2s. There are no new pixels created.', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, there are no changes in objects. All objects remain the same, but their positions change due to the filling of zeros.'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'In these examples, we see a pattern where an input grid containing certain colors is transformed into an output grid where those colors are replaced with zeros. This process may involve filling in missing pixels or changing the position of existing pixels. However, it always results in a grid with only zeros and no new pixels are added.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to fill in any missing pixels with zeros and adjust the position of existing pixels so that they align with the output grid. You can do this by iterating through each row and column of the input grid and replacing any non-zero value with a zero. If a cell in the input grid is located at (i,j) and the corresponding cell in the output grid is also located at (i,j), then the value in the output grid should be equal to the value in the input grid. Otherwise, the value in the output grid should be a zero. Once you have filled in all the missing pixels and adjusted the position of existing pixels, the output grid will be identical to the output grid shown in the examples.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[3, 9, 5, 0], [3, 0, 5, 2], [3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 9, 5, 2]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'Regarding the test input, the pixels of the entire grid are as follows:', 'test_case_object_view': 'There are no objects present in the test input grid.', 'test_case_transformation': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, iterate through each row and column of the input grid and replace any non-zero value with a zero. If a cell in the input grid is located at (i,j) and the corresponding cell in the output grid is also located at (i,j), then the value in the output grid should be equal to the value in the input grid. Otherwise, the value in the output grid should be a zero. After completing this process, the output grid should be identical to the output grid shown in the examples.', 'test_case_output': '[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]'}}
Note: For Example 2, the output grid is not correct as the bottom left corner of the output grid should have a value of 1 instead of 0.
