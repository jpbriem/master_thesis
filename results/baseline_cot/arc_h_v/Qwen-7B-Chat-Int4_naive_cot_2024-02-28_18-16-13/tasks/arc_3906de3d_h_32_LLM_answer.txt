prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the common pattern among the given input-output pairs. We can see that each pair consists of an input grid and an output grid where certain cells have been replaced with other cells. In some cases, the replacement involves flipping the color of a cell, while in others it involves moving the cell to another position.
Let's define some terms:

  * Pixel: A unit of digital data that typically represents a color value.
  * Grid: An arrangement of pixels arranged in rows and columns.
  * Transformation: A change in the structure or appearance of a grid.
  * Object: A group of connected pixels that share the same color or property.

Based on these definitions, we can infer the following rules:

  * Each input grid corresponds to a unique output grid.
  * There exists a mapping function that maps each pixel in the input grid to its corresponding pixel in the output grid.
  * The mapping function preserves the color and location of each object in the input grid.
  * The mapping function may involve transforming objects by applying geometric operations such as rotation, scaling, translation, etc.

Given these rules, we can write a Python script that takes an input grid as input and produces an output grid as output using the mapping function described above. Here's an example implementation:
```python
def transform(input_grid):
    # Define the mapping function
    def map_pixel(pixel):
        if pixel == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            # Flip the color of the pixel
            return 3 - pixel

    # Apply the mapping function to each pixel in the grid
    output_grid = []
    for row in input_grid:
        output_row = []
        for pixel in row:
            output_row.append(map_pixel(pixel))
        output_grid.append(output_row)

    return output_grid

# Test the function with the given test case
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3],
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]
]

output_grid = transform(input_grid)
print("Output grid:")
for row in output_grid:
    print(row)
```

This implementation defines a simple mapping function that flips the color of each pixel in the input grid. The output grid will contain the same number of pixels as the input grid but with each pixel flipped in color. This is just one possible solution to the problem; there could be many other solutions depending on the specific requirements of the transformation.
