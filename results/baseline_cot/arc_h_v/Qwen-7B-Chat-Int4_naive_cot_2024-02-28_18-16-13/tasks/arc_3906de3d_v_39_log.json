            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0], [8, 7, 8, 8, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0]]\noutput: [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 8, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given input-output pairs follow a common pattern where the pixels of an image are transformed such that each pixel's value increases by 1 compared to its original position. This pattern can be described as a shift operation along the x-axis, with the exception of the last two images, which involve additional operations such as rotation and scaling.\nTo transform the test case input grid, we can apply this pattern to it as follows:\n\n  * Shift the first row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the first element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the second row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the second element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the third row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the third element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the fourth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the fourth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the fifth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the fifth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the sixth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the sixth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the seventh row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the seventh element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the eighth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the eighth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the ninth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the ninth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the tenth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the tenth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the eleventh row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the eleventh element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the twelfth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the twelfth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the thirteenth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the thirteenth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the fourteenth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the fourteenth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n  * Shift the fifteenth row of pixels one column to the right, i.e., replace the fifteenth element (7) with 6 and move all other elements one space to the left.\n\nAfter applying these shifts, the test case input grid will look like this:\n\n```\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0]\n[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]\n\n```\n\n\nThis transformed grid corresponds to the output of the example input provided, which was also a test case. Therefore, the output of this test case would be:\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0],\n [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]]\n```"
