prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

output: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 6, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
To understand the problem better, let's analyze each example:

Example_1:
The input has 2 rows and 10 columns, where some cells contain a value of 9 and others contain a value of 0. In the output, we see that the cells containing a value of 9 were moved to the top row, while the cells containing a value of 0 were moved to the bottom row. This suggests that the transformation involves shifting the entire grid vertically. 

Example_2:
In this example, the input grid contains 5 rows and 5 columns. Some cells contain a value of 6, and some cells contain a value of 0. In the output, we see that the cells containing a value of 6 were moved to the leftmost column, while the cells containing a value of 0 remained unchanged. This suggests that the transformation involves shifting the entire grid horizontally.

Example_3:
This example is similar to Example_2, but it shows another way of transforming the grid. Here, the input grid contains 5 rows and 5 columns. However, instead of moving the entire grid horizontally, we see that the cells containing a value of 0 were moved to the rightmost column. This suggests that the transformation involves shifting the entire grid horizontally.

Based on these observations, we can define the transformation pattern as follows:

Transform any input grid into an output grid such that:
- Each cell in the input grid corresponds to a unique cell in the output grid.
- If a cell in the input grid contains a value of 0, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will also contain a value of 0.
- Otherwise, if a cell in the input grid contains a value other than 0, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will contain the same value.
- The cells containing a value other than 0 will be shifted horizontally or vertically depending on the specific transformation.

Now, let's apply this transformation pattern to the given test case:

Input:
[[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

Explanation:
In the above output, we can observe that the input grid was shifted horizontally so that the cells containing a value of 9 were placed at the top row, and the cells containing a value of 0 were placed at the bottom row. Similarly, the input grid was shifted vertically so that the cells containing a value of 6 were placed to the leftmost column, and the cells containing a value of 0 were placed to the rightmost column.
