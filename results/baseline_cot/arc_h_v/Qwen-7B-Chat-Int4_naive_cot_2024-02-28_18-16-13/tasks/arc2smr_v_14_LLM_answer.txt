prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given examples seem to involve a type of binary pattern where some regions are filled with black pixels (represented by the digit 0), while others are filled with white pixels (represented by the digit 6). The regions that contain both white and black pixels appear to be shaped like squares, with four sides of equal length. 

In Example 1, the two input grids have the same overall pattern, but differ slightly in the placement and size of the white and black regions. In Example 2, the input grid has a different overall pattern, with more white and fewer black regions arranged differently.

It seems that this pattern could be generated using a combination of rotation, translation, and mirroring operations applied to a basic template of a square grid containing alternating black and white pixels. For example, starting with an initial grid consisting entirely of black pixels, one could rotate it about its center by 45 degrees and then translate it horizontally and vertically by half the side length of the original grid. This would create a new grid with alternating rows of white and black pixels, which could then be further transformed through additional operations such as mirroring or scaling to produce the desired output patterns.

Overall Pattern:

Based on the provided examples, the input-output relationships seem to involve transforming a grid of pixels into another grid of pixels with the same overall pattern, but potentially different sizes and positions. The transformations may include rotation, translation, mirroring, and scaling operations applied to a basic template of a square grid containing alternating black and white pixels.

Instructions:

To generate the desired output patterns, you will need to apply a sequence of transformations to the input grid. Here are some general instructions for doing so:

1. Start with an initial grid consisting entirely of black pixels.

2. Apply a rotation operation to the grid around its center by 45 degrees. This will create a grid with alternating rows of white and black pixels.

3. Translate the grid horizontally and vertically by half the side length of the original grid. This will move the grid's position relative to the origin point.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 several times to achieve the desired overall pattern.

5. If necessary, scale the grid up or down to adjust its size.

6. Finally, apply any other desired transformations, such as mirroring or reflection, to complete the process.

Note that these instructions are just a general guideline, and the specific details of each transformation may vary depending on the desired output pattern. You may need to experiment with different parameters and combinations of operations to find the best results.
