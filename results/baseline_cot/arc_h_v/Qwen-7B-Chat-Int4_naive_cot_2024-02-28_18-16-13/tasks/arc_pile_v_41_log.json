            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 7, 0], [0, 0, 2, 7, 9]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 1, 9, 0, 0], [7, 1, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 0], [7, 1, 9, 5, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[7, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2], [7, 0, 3, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe input-output pairs provided exhibit a common pattern where each pixel value is replaced with the average value of its neighboring pixels, and any remaining non-zero values are assigned the maximum value in the input grid. This pattern is referred to as mean-value interpolation.\nFor Example_1, the input grid has five rows and six columns, with two identical blocks of four pixels each, separated by a block of three pixels. The output grid shows that these blocks have been merged together, creating a new block of seven pixels. In this way, the transformation preserved the overall structure of the input grid while filling in missing data.\nIn Example_2, the input grid consists of a set of connected rectangles, each containing a unique combination of colors. The output grid reflects this connectivity by preserving the relative positions and sizes of the rectangles, but replacing their colors with the dominant color found in their neighbors.\nIn Example_3, the input grid contains a series of connected circles, each with a unique color. The output grid reflects this connectivity by preserving the relative positions and sizes of the circles, but replacing their colors with the dominant color found in their neighbors.\nOverall Pattern:\nThis pattern involves replacing each pixel value in an input grid with the average value of its neighboring pixels, and assigning any remaining non-zero values the maximum value in the input grid. This results in a smooth transition between adjacent pixels, preserving the overall structure of the input grid while filling in missing data.\nInstructions:\n\n  * Iterate over each row and column in the input grid.\n  * For each pixel, calculate the sum of its eight nearest neighbors (including itself).\n  * Divide the sum by nine to obtain the average value of the neighbors.\n  * Assign this value to the current pixel.\n  * If the current pixel value is already zero, assign it the maximum value in the input grid (which is typically 9).\n\nTransformed Input Grid:\n[[7, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 3, 0, 0]]\nTransformed Output Grid:\n[[7, 6, 3, 0, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 3, 0, 9]]"
