prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1], [5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 7, 0, 1], [5, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 1], [5, 9, 0, 7, 4, 1], [5, 9, 0, 7, 4, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 8, 0, 0, 1, 7]]



Test case:
input: [[6, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0], [0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
Example 1 describes an input where each row has two identical columns (one blue and one white). The output has the same structure but the colors have been flipped. This corresponds to a reflection about the vertical axis.
Example 2 describes an input where each column has four identical rows. The output has the same structure but the colors have been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. This corresponds to a rotation about the horizontal axis.
Example 3 describes an input where each column has six identical rows. The output has the same structure but the colors have been scaled down by a factor of two. This corresponds to an scaling operation that reduces the size of each pixel by half.
Overall Pattern: The overall pattern is that each input is transformed into an output that reflects, rotates, or scales the input. These operations are applied independently to each column or row of the input grid, respectively.
Instructions: To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to perform the appropriate reflection, rotation, or scaling operation on each column or row of the input grid. For reflections, rotate the input grid counterclockwise by 180 degrees around its center point. For rotations, apply the appropriate angle to each column or row using the `numpy.rot90()` function. For scalings, divide each element of each column or row by the desired scale factor.
For example, if the desired scale factor is 2, you would replace each element in the input grid with twice its value before applying any other transformation.
Note that these operations are applied independently to each column or row of the input grid, so the order in which they are performed matters.
Test Case Input: Here is the input grid:
```
[[6, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0],
 [0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 3],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
 [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
 [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
```

To transform this input into the expected output, you would follow these steps:

  * Reflect the first column about the vertical axis using the `numpy.flipud()` function.
  * Rotate the second column clockwise by 90 degrees using the `numpy.rot90()` function with an argument of -1.
  * Scale the third column by a factor of 2 using the `numpy.multiply()` function with an argument of 2.
  * Reflect the fourth column about the vertical axis using the `numpy.fliplr()` function.
  * Rotate the fifth column clockwise by 90 degrees using the `numpy.rot90()` function with an argument of -1.
  * Scale the sixth column by a factor of 2 using the `numpy.multiply()` function with an argument of 2.

After performing these operations, the expected output would be:
```
[[6, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0],
 [0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 3],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
 [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
```
