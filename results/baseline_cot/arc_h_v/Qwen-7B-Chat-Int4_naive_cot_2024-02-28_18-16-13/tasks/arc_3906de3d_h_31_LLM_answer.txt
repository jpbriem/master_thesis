prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given input-output pairs demonstrate that the underlying transformation pattern involves copying and repeating objects based on their geometric proximity. Specifically, when two or more identical objects touch each other, they will be merged together, forming a larger copy of the original object. This pattern can be seen in Examples 1 and 3, where the input grid contains multiple copies of the same object, and the output grid shows a single copy of the object covering the entire grid.
In Example 2, the input grid contains two objects that do not overlap but are separated by some distance. However, the output grid shows these two objects connected through a line, suggesting that the transformation has somehow combined them into a single object.
To create the output grid, we need to iterate over each cell in the input grid and check if it contains an object. If so, we need to identify neighboring cells that also contain objects, and merge them into a single copy of the object. We then repeat this process until no more objects are left in the grid.
Here's a possible implementation of the algorithm:

```
def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a dictionary to store the number of objects per coordinate
    num_objects = {}
    for i in range(len(input_grid)):
        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):
            if input_grid[i][j]:
                if (i, j) in num_objects:
                    num_objects[(i, j)] += 1
                else:
                    num_objects[(i, j)] = 1
    
    # Iterate over each cell in the grid
    for i in range(len(input_grid)):
        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):
            # Check if there are any objects in this cell
            if input_grid[i][j]:
                # Identify neighboring cells containing objects
                neighbors = [(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)]
                num_neighbors = 0
                for neighbor in neighbors:
                    if neighbor in num_objects:
                        num_neighbors += num_objects[neighbor]
                
                # Merge neighboring objects into a single copy
                if num_neighbors > 1:
                    new_obj = True
                    while new_obj:
                        # Choose random direction to move the object
                        direction = np.random.choice(['up', 'down', 'left', 'right'])
                        # Move the object in the chosen direction
                        x, y = i, j
                        if direction == 'up':
                            y -= 1
                        elif direction == 'down':
                            y += 1
                        elif direction == 'left':
                            x -= 1
                        elif direction == 'right':
                            x += 1
                        
                        # Check if the new position is out of bounds
                        if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= len(input_grid) or y >= len(input_grid[0]):
                            new_obj = False
                            break
                        
                        # Check if the new position overlaps with another object
                        if input_grid[x][y]:
                            new_obj = False
                            break
                        
                        # Update the input grid
                        input_grid[x][y] = 0
                        input_grid[i][j] = 0
                        num_objects[(x, y)] = 0
                        num_objects[(i, j)] = 0
                    
                    # If the object was successfully moved, update the output grid
                    if new_obj:
                        output_grid[i][j] = 1
    return output_grid
```

This function takes an input grid as a parameter, where `True` indicates that a cell contains an object and `False` indicates that a cell does not contain an object. It returns an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, where `True` indicates that a cell contains an object and `False` indicates that a cell does not contain an object.
Note that this implementation assumes that the input grid is a 2D matrix of integers, where `True` indicates that a cell contains an object and `False` indicates that a cell does not contain an object. You may need to modify this code to match the specific requirements of your problem.
