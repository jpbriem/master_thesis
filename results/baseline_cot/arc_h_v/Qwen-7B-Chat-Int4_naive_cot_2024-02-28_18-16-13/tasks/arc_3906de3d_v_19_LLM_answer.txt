prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
Input-Output Pattern Explanation:

In this problem, we are given two types of inputs: input grids that represent an image and object grids that represent individual objects in the image. We are also given three outputs: the updated input grid after applying a transformation, the updated object grid after applying a transformation, and a description of the transformation itself.

The transformation involves scaling, rotation, translation, and mirroring of the objects and the image. In some cases, there may be no change in the image or objects, while in other cases, significant changes may occur.

For example, in Example 1, the transformation scales each object by 2 and translates them by (2, 2). As a result, the objects' positions shift and their sizes increase by a factor of 2. The input grid remains unchanged because it does not contain any objects.

In Example 2, the transformation rotates each object by 90 degrees counterclockwise. As a result, the orientation of the objects changes. The input grid remains unchanged because it does not contain any objects.

Overall, the input-output relationships are determined by the specific transformation applied to the objects and the image.

Instructions:

To solve this problem, you need to follow these steps:

1. Read the input grid and determine the type of transformation applied to it (scale, rotate, translate, or mirror).
2. Apply the transformation to the objects and update the object grid accordingly.
3. Update the input grid by replacing the original objects with the transformed ones.
4. Output the updated input and object grids along with a description of the transformation.

Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
def apply_transform(grid):
    # Implement your transformation logic here
    pass

def process_image(input_grid):
    # Apply the transformation to the input grid
    transformed_grid = apply_transform(input_grid)

    # Create an empty object grid
    obj_grid = np.zeros(transformed_grid.shape)

    # Iterate over the pixels in the transformed grid
    for i in range(transformed_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(transformed_grid.shape[1]):
            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:
                # Find the indices of the original object
                x, y = divmod(i - transformed_grid.shape[0] // 2, transformed_grid.shape[0])
                w, h = divmod(j - transformed_grid.shape[1] // 2, transformed_grid.shape[1])

                # Extract the object from the original grid
                obj = input_grid[y:y+h, x:x+w]

                # Apply the transformation to the object
                obj = apply_transform(obj)

                # Replace the original object with the transformed one in the object grid
                obj_grid[y:y+h, x:x+w] = obj

    return obj_grid

# Test the function
input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
obj_grid = process_image(input_grid)
print("Original Input Grid:")
plt.imshow(input_grid, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
print("Transformed Object Grid:")
plt.imshow(obj_grid, cmap='gray')
plt.show()

transform_description = "This example demonstrates the application of a translation transformation."
print(f"The transformation description is: {transform_description}")
```

Note that this is just an example implementation and you will need to modify it according to the requirements of the problem.
