prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern:

The input-output pairs follow a consistent pattern where the input consists of an array of pixels represented as integers (0-9), and the output consists of the same array but with some pixels changed according to certain rules. 

Instructions:

To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid: An object is defined as a group of adjacent pixels that have the same value. We can count the number of objects in the input grid using nested loops and keep track of their position and size.

2. Determine the operations to apply to each object: Depending on the specific transformation pattern, we may need to perform different operations on each object. For example, if the pattern involves rotating or scaling objects, we would need to rotate or scale them accordingly.

3. Apply the operations to each object: Once we know what operation to perform on each object, we can apply it to the object's pixels. This will involve modifying the pixels' values according to the desired transformation.

4. Update the output grid: After applying the operations to each object, we can update the output grid by replacing the original pixels with the modified ones.

Here is an example implementation of this algorithm:
```python
def transform(input):
    # Step 1: Identify objects
    num_objects = 0
    x_coords = []
    y_coords = []
    sizes = []

    for i in range(len(input)):
        for j in range(len(input[i])):
            if input[i][j] == input[i+1][j]:
                num_objects += 1
                x_coords.append(i)
                y_coords.append(j)
                sizes.append(1)

            elif input[i][j] != input[i+1][j]:
                if len(x_coords) > 0:
                    sizes[-1] += 1

    # Step 2: Determine operations to apply to each object
    operations = {
        "rotate": lambda x, y, size: [(x - size/2, y - size/2 + i * size) for i in range(size)],
        "scale": lambda x, y, size: [(x - size/2, y - size/2 + i * size) for i in range(size)],
        "translate": lambda x, y, size: [(x + i * size, y) for i in range(size)]
    }

    # Step 3: Apply operations to each object
    output = []
    for i in range(num_objects):
        op = operations["translate"] if sizes[i] % 2 == 0 else operations["scale"]
        x, y = x_coords[i], y_coords[i]
        size = sizes[i]

        new_x, new_y = op(x, y, size)
        output.append([new_x, new_y])

    # Step 4: Update output grid
    return output
```

This function takes in an input grid of integers and returns an output grid of tuples containing the new x and y coordinates of each object after applying the specified transformation. Note that this implementation assumes that the input grid has no gaps or holes, and that there is always exactly one object per row and column. If these assumptions do not hold true, additional checks and modifications may be necessary.
