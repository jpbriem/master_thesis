prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern that connects the objects together. We can see that each object consists of four tiles, arranged in a specific way. Let's call these tiles A, B, C, and D. 

In Example 1, the objects are rearranged such that tile A moves to the right, tile B stays in place, tile C moves up, and tile D moves left. In Example 2, tile A moves up, tile B moves down, tile C stays in place, and tile D moves right. 

From these examples, it seems like there is a fixed sequence of movements that can be applied to any set of objects to achieve a desired outcome. To determine the exact sequence of movements, we need more information about the objects' initial positions and their desired final positions. 

Once we have this information, we can create a function that takes an input grid and returns an output grid after applying the appropriate sequence of movements. Here's some sample code that demonstrates this approach:

```python
def transform(input_grid):
    # Define the sequence of movements
    movements = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    # Create an empty output grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Iterate over each row and column of the input grid
    for i in range(len(input_grid)):
        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):
            # Determine the current object type and position
            if input_grid[i][j] == 4:
                x = j
                y = i

                # Move the object according to the sequence of movements
                for m in movements:
                    x += m[0]
                    y += m[1]

                # Place the object in the output grid
                output_grid[y][x] = 4

            elif input_grid[i][j] == 6:
                # Place the object in the output grid
                output_grid[y][x] = 6

    return output_grid
```

This function takes an input grid as a 2D NumPy array and returns an output grid as another 2D NumPy array. It uses a pre-defined sequence of movements to move the objects around, and places them in the output grid according to their new positions. Note that this implementation assumes that the objects do not overlap, and that they always fit in the available space. If the objects overlap or exceed the boundaries of the input grid, further processing may be needed to resolve these issues.
