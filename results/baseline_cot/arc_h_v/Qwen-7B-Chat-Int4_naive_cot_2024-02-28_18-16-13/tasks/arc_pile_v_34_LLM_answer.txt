prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 4, 0, 1], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 7, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 7, 0], [0, 5, 4, 7, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 8]]

Example_3:
input: [[6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3], [6, 4, 5, 0, 0, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 2, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

The output grid has the same structure but the pixels are rearranged so that the first column contains two rows, the second column contains three rows, the third column contains two rows, and the remaining columns contain one row each. The pixels in the first and third columns remain unchanged, while the pixels in the second and fourth columns switch positions.', 'object_changes': 'None'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The overall pattern is that the input grid is transformed into an output grid where the rows are rearranged so that they form a pattern that matches the desired output grid. This pattern can vary depending on the specific input grid and output grid provided in the examples.', 'instructions': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to rearrange the rows of the input grid so that they match the pattern of the output grid. You can do this by manually manipulating the pixels in the input grid or using algorithms that automatically detect and rearrange the rows. Once you have achieved the desired arrangement of rows, you can create the final output grid by copying the rearranged rows into a new matrix with the same dimensions as the original input grid.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 2, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'The input grid consists of five columns and five rows. The first row contains three black pixels, while the second row contains two white pixels and the third row contains two red pixels. The fourth row contains three green pixels and the fifth row contains three blue pixels.', 'test_case_object_view': 'There are no objects in this input grid.', 'test_case_transformation': 'To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to rearrange the rows so that they match the pattern of the output grid. One possible way to achieve this is to swap the second and third rows of the input grid, which will result in the following output grid:', 'test_case_output': '[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]'}}
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

This solution swaps the second and third rows of the input grid, resulting in the output grid shown above.
