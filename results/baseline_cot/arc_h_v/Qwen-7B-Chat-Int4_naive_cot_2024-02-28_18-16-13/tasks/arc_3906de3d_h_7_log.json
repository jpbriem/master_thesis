            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern that connects the input and output grids. It seems that each row and column in the input grid has a specific value (either 0 or 7) that corresponds to a certain position in the output grid. Specifically, if there is a 7 in an input cell, then it will appear in the corresponding output cell. \n\nTo determine the exact transformation rules, we can analyze the given examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nWe can see that the output grid consists of blocks of consecutive zeros followed by blocks of consecutive sevens. This suggests that the transformation rule involves replacing each block of zeros with a block of sevens. In other words, if there is a sequence of zeros in the input grid, then we replace it with a sequence of sevens in the output grid. \n\nSimilarly, Example 2 also shows that the output grid consists of blocks of consecutive zeros followed by blocks of consecutive sevens. Therefore, we can apply the same transformation rule to Example 2.\n\nTherefore, the transformation rule for both Examples 1 and 2 is: Replace each block of zeros in the input grid with a block of sevens in the output grid.\n\nNow let's move on to the next part of the question, where we need to create the resulting output grid as a numpy array. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols))\n\n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the current cell is a zero, replace it with a seven\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                output_grid[i][j] = 7\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThis function takes the input grid as an argument and returns the transformed output grid as a numpy array. You can call this function with the input grid provided in the question to get the transformed output grid."
