prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
This appears to be a set of examples that involve transforming a two-dimensional grid of pixels into another two-dimensional grid. Each example consists of multiple input and output grids, where each grid has the same dimensions but contains different pixel values. The goal of the transformation seems to be to create an output grid that is related to the input grid in some way, such as containing the same objects or having the same overall structure.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules that govern the transformation process. From the given information, it seems that the transformation involves applying certain operations to the pixels of the input grid, such as copying, repeating, and rotating. These operations may also depend on the location of the pixels within the grid.
Based on these observations, we can make the following assumptions:

  * The transformation is applied to each individual pixel of the input grid, rather than to entire groups of pixels.
  * The transformation does not affect the pixel values themselves, but rather the arrangement of the pixels on the grid.
  * The transformation is reversible, meaning that if we apply the inverse operation to the output grid, we should obtain the original input grid.

With these assumptions in mind, we can begin to develop a solution strategy. One possible approach is to start by identifying the key features of the input and output grids that are relevant to the transformation process. For example, we could look for common patterns, such as lines, shapes, and colors, that appear in both the input and output grids. We could then use these patterns as a starting point for developing a more detailed understanding of the transformation process.
Once we have a good understanding of the transformation process, we can begin to apply it to the input grid. This will involve applying the appropriate operations to each pixel of the grid, using the knowledge we gained about the patterns and features of the input and output grids. Finally, we can compare the transformed output grid to the original input grid to ensure that they match as closely as possible.
Overall, solving this problem requires a combination of careful observation, logical reasoning, and creative thinking. By carefully analyzing the input and output grids, and using our understanding of the transformation process to guide us, we can develop a successful solution that transforms the input grid into the desired output grid.
