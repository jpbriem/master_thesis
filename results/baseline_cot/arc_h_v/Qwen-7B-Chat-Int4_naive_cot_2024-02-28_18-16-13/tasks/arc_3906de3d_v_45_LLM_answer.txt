prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern that governs the transformation. Based on the given examples, it seems that the input grid is divided into smaller regions (objects), and each object has a specific color. The goal is to transform these objects such that they maintain their relative positions but change their color. 

Here's an example of how we could approach this problem:

```python
def transform(input):
    # Define a dictionary to map object colors to new colors
    color_map = {
        '0': 'red',
        '2': 'blue',
        '3': 'green'
    }

    # Iterate over each row and column of the input grid
    for i in range(len(input)):
        for j in range(len(input[0])):
            # Check if the current cell contains an object
            if input[i][j] != '0':
                # Get the old color of the object
                old_color = input[i][j]
                # Find the new color for the object based on its position
                new_color = color_map.get(old_color)
                # Replace the old color with the new color in the input grid
                input[i][j] = new_color

    return input

# Test the function
input = [
    ['8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0'],
    ['8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0'],
    ['8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0'],
    ['8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0'],
    ['8', '8', '0', '8', '8', '8', '0', '8', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '8', '8', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '8', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '3', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '3', '0', '0', '0', '0', '3', '0', '0']
]

print(transform(input))
```

This code defines a dictionary `color_map` that maps old object colors to new colors. It then iterates over each cell in the input grid and checks if it contains an object. If it does, it gets the old color of the object and finds the new color based on its position in the dictionary. Finally, it replaces the old color with the new color in the input grid.

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to implement the transformation algorithm depending on the exact requirements of the problem.
