prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
Input/output pairs Example_1 and Example_2 share the same underlying transformation pattern. In both cases, the pixels of the grid are transformed such that each object is replaced by its mirror image along the horizontal axis. This means that every object is flipped horizontally, creating an identical copy of it on the other side of the grid. 

In Example_3, the input grid consists of two objects separated by a gap. The output grid shows the same two objects, but they are now connected together through a bridge-like structure. The transformation pattern involves joining the two objects into a continuous line, effectively connecting them.

Overall Pattern: All three input/output pairs involve some form of reflection, rotation, translation, or combination of these operations. The transformation patterns follow a consistent rule, where each object is either mirrored, rotated, translated, or joined with another object to create a new pattern.

Instructions:

  * To transform the test case input grid, you need to apply the transformation rules mentioned above to each object in the grid.
  * Start by identifying the objects in the input grid. These are typically areas of the grid that contain the same color or have similar characteristics.
  * For each object, apply the appropriate transformation operation(s) to create its mirror image, rotate it, translate it, or join it with another object.
  * Repeat this process for all objects in the grid until you obtain the desired output grid.

Test Case Input/Output Copy:
