prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern that connects the input and output grids. We can see that there are certain regions of the input grid that correspond to specific objects in the output grid. These objects have a consistent spatial arrangement and appear in groups of three, each group containing an object of a different color.
Based on this observation, we can infer that the input grid represents a set of colored squares arranged in a particular way, while the output grid represents a set of connected objects of three different colors, where each object is composed of three colored squares.
To generate the output grid, we can start by identifying the locations of the objects in the input grid. This can be done using simple image processing techniques such as thresholding and edge detection. Once we have identified the locations of the objects, we can create the corresponding objects in the output grid by connecting them together using lines.
Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
import cv2

def transform(input_image):
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(input_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Apply thresholding to identify objects
    _, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 180, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    
    # Find contours in the thresholded image
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Create empty output image
    output_image = np.zeros_like(input_image)
    
    # Iterate over contours and draw objects in the output image
    for contour in contours:
        x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
        
        if w > 6 and h > 6:  # Only consider objects larger than 6x6
        
            # Draw bounding box around the object
            cv2.rectangle(output_image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
            
            # Draw the object itself
            cv2.fillPoly(output_image, [contour], (0, 0, 0))
    
    return output_image
```

This implementation uses OpenCV library to perform image processing tasks such as thresholding, finding contours, and drawing bounding boxes and filled polygons. It also defines some criteria for considering an object large enough to be included in the output grid, but these can be adjusted depending on the desired level of detail.
Using this function, we can apply it to the given input grid and obtain the corresponding output grid. For example:

```python
input_image = ...  # Load input image here
output_image = transform(input_image)

# Display input and output images
cv2.imshow('Input Image', input_image)
cv2.imshow('Output Image', output_image)

cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In conclusion, the provided test cases represent examples of transformations where the objects are copied, repeated, or resized. To find the overall pattern shared by all input-output pairs, we need to analyze more examples and look for commonalities in terms of the type of transformations applied and the properties of the objects involved.
