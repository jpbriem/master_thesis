            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

Here's an explanation of each part:\n\n  * `Example_1_description`: This field describes the first example and provides information about what has been transformed. In this case, it states that the input grid contains 1s and 0s where 1s represent solid pixels and 0s represent empty ones. It also mentions that the output grid is formed by connecting neighboring pixels that have the same value. Finally, it notes that there are no additional objects in the grid.\n  * `Example_2_description`: This field describes the second example and provides information about what has been transformed. In this case, it states that the input grid contains 8s, 0s, and 3s where 8s represent solid pixels, 0s represent empty ones, and 3s represent partially filled pixels. It also mentions that the output grid is formed by filling in missing parts of the input grid using the rules described in Example_1.\n  * `Overall_pattern`: This field summarizes the overall pattern of the input-output relationships across all examples. In this case, it states that the input grid contains 1s, 8s, 0s, and 3s where the output grid is formed by connecting neighboring pixels that have the same value or by filling in missing parts of the input grid using the rules described in Example_1.\n  * `Instructions`: This field provides detailed steps for transforming the input grid into the output grid. These steps involve finding neighboring pixels that have the same value, connecting them together, and filling in missing parts of the input grid using the rules described in Example_1.\n  * `Test_case_input_copy`: This field provides a copy of the input grid for testing purposes. In this case, it contains a grid of 1s, 8s, 0s, and 3s.\n  * `Test_case_grid_view`: This field provides a view of the input grid for testing purposes. In this case, it shows a grid of 1s, 8s, 0s, and 3s.\n  * `Test_case_object_view`: This field provides a view of any objects in the input grid for testing purposes. In this case, there are no objects in the input grid.\n  * `Test_case_transformation`: This field provides details of the transformation that needs to be performed on the input grid. In this case, it involves finding neighboring pixels that have the same value and connecting them together, and filling in missing parts of the input grid using the rules described in Example_1.\n  * `Test_case_output`: This field provides the expected output grid after applying the transformation specified in the `Test_case_transformation` field. In this case, it shows a grid of 1s, 8s, 0s, and 3s.\n\nTo solve the given task, we need to follow the `Instructions` provided to transform the input grid into the output grid. We can start by reading the input grid from the `Test_case_input_copy` field and visualizing it using the `Test_case_grid_view`. Once we understand the structure of the input grid, we can apply the transformation specified in the `Test_case_transformation` field to generate the output grid. Finally, we can compare the output grid generated by our solution with the `Test_case_output` to ensure that they match."
