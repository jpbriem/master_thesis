prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
Task: Given an input grid, determine the pattern of transformation that transforms it into another grid. Each cell can change in value or move to a neighboring cell (horizontally or vertically) but cannot cross the boundaries of the grid. The goal is to identify the rules governing this transformation and apply them to other inputs.
Pattern Description:

  * There may be multiple patterns depending on the specific requirements of the transformation.
  * The transformation may involve rotation, translation, scaling, mirroring, reflection, or any combination of these operations.
  * Some cells may remain unchanged during the transformation, while others may change their values or positions.
  * The transformation may also involve grouping cells together or separating them apart.
  * The transformation may require applying multiple steps to achieve the desired result.

Instructions:

  * Analyze the given input grid and try to understand the transformation that would produce the given output grid.
  * Look for commonalities between the two grids such as the presence of certain patterns or shapes.
  * Identify the key elements of the transformation such as the type of operation(s), the direction of movement, and the scale of the transformation.
  * Test your understanding of the transformation by applying it to new inputs.

Overall Pattern:

  * The overall pattern involves identifying the transformation that produces the given output from the given input. This requires analyzing both the input and output grids and looking for similarities and differences between them.
  * Once you have identified the key elements of the transformation, you can apply them to new inputs to generate the desired output.
