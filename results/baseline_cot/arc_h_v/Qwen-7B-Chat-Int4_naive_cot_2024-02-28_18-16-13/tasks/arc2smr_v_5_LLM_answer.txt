prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
Example_1 describes an operation where the input grid has two identical regions separated by a line segment, and the output grid reflects this separation by creating two separate objects, each containing four identical squares. This transformation involves a combination of translation, rotation, and reflection operations.

Example_2 describes a similar operation but with more complex inputs that involve multiple regions of different colors. The output grid reflects these differences by creating multiple objects, each containing a unique set of squares. This transformation involves a combination of translation, rotation, and reflection operations.

Example_3 describes a more general transformation where the input grid contains several small regions of different colors that are combined into larger objects. The output grid reflects this complexity by creating multiple objects, each containing a combination of smaller regions. This transformation involves a combination of translation, rotation, and reflection operations.

Overall Pattern: The overall pattern shared among these examples is that the input grid is transformed into an output grid through a series of geometric and topological operations such as translation, rotation, and reflection. These operations reflect the properties of the input grid, such as the presence of lines, rectangles, and polygons, and create new objects that accurately represent the input data.

Instructions:

  * Translate the input grid along the x-axis to move it to the left or right.
  * Translate the input grid along the y-axis to move it up or down.
  * Rotate the input grid around its center point counterclockwise or clockwise by any angle.
  * Reflect the input grid across the horizontal or vertical axis to create mirror images.
  * Combine multiple input grids into a single grid by overlaying them.
  * Apply combinations of these operations to create more complex transformations.
