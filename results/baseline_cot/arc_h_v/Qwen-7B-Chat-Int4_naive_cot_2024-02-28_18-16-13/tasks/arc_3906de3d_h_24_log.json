            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe overall pattern shared among the given input-output pairs is that they involve some kind of transformation that takes an input grid and produces an output grid with different objects and/or positions. Specifically, each pair involves transforming a grid with certain objects into another grid where the objects have been moved or resized, or new objects may have been added. Additionally, there seems to be a connection between the size of the objects and their position within the grid.\nTo transform the test case input grid into its test case output grid, we need to apply the same pattern of transformation to it. Without knowing more about the specific details of the transformation process, it's difficult to provide a detailed answer. However, here's a general outline of what steps could potentially be involved:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input grid and their current positions and sizes.\n  2. Determine the desired positions and sizes of the objects in the output grid.\n  3. Apply any necessary scaling or rotation to the objects to bring them into the correct positions.\n  4. Move the objects to their desired positions in the output grid.\n  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for any additional objects in the output grid.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just a high-level overview of the possible steps involved in the transformation process, and the exact details will depend on the specifics of the input and output grids and the desired outcome. To create a more accurate description of the transformation process, you'll likely need more information about the requirements and constraints of the problem."
