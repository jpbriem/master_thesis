            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

This pattern appears to involve some kind of reflection symmetry about the center of the grid, as well as a rotation of 90 degrees counterclockwise around the center point. The transformation may also involve some degree of scaling, depending on the specific implementation.\nTo solve this problem, we need to define a function that takes in a grid of pixels and returns a transformed version of the grid according to the specified pattern. Here's an example implementation in Python:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reflect the grid across the center line\n    reflected = np.fliplr(grid)\n    \n    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise\n    rotated = np.rot90(reflected)\n    \n    # Scale the grid if necessary\n    scaled = np.zeros_like(rotated)\n    scale_factor = 2 if rotated.shape[0] == 7 else 3\n    scaled[scaled != 0] = rotated[scaled != 0]\n    scaled = scaled.reshape((int(scaled.shape[0]/scale_factor), scale_factor))\n    \n    return scaled\n```\n\nThis implementation reflects the grid across the center line using `np.fliplr`, rotates it 90 degrees counterclockwise using `np.rot90`, and then scales it if necessary using `np.zeros_like` and `reshape`. Note that the scaling factor is chosen to ensure that the final grid has the correct dimensions after reflecting and rotating.\nWith this implementation, we can apply the transformation to the provided test cases as follows:\n```scss\n# Test Case 1\ngrid1 = np.array([[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\ntransformed_grid1 = transform(grid1)\n\n# Test Case 2\ngrid2 = np.array([[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [6, 0, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 0, 0]])\ntransformed_grid2 = transform(grid2)\n\n# Test Case 3\ngrid3 = np.array([[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]])\ntransformed_grid3 = transform(grid3)\n\n# Output\nprint(\"Transformed Grid 1:\")\nprint(transformed_grid1)\nprint(\"Transformed Grid 2:\")\nprint(transformed_grid2)\nprint(\"Transformed Grid 3:\")\nprint(transformed_grid3)\n```\n\nNote that these transformations preserve the overall shape and size of the original grid, while altering the arrangement of the individual pixels. In general, the transformations used in this problem depend on the specific rules governing the movement of the pixels in the input grids. To determine the exact transformation, you will need to analyze the patterns present in the input grids and identify any underlying geometric or topological relationships between them."
