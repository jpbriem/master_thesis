prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
Task Explanation:

In this problem, you will be given a set of instructions that define how to transform a grid of pixels into another grid. Each instruction describes a specific operation to be performed on the pixels, such as moving them around, changing their color, or combining them into larger groups.

To solve this task, you need to follow each instruction carefully and apply it to the grid accordingly. You may also need to modify the grid's dimensions or create new cells if necessary.

Overall Pattern:

The overall pattern of this task is that you are transforming a grid of pixels according to a series of instructions. Each instruction specifies a particular action to be taken on the grid, such as moving pixels, changing their color, or creating new cells.

Instructions:

There are several types of instructions that you may encounter in this task. Here are some common ones:

1. Move pixels: Instructions that tell you to move a group of pixels from one location to another.
2. Change color: Instructions that tell you to change the color of a group of pixels.
3. Combine pixels: Instructions that tell you to combine two or more groups of pixels into a single group.
4. Create new cells: Instructions that tell you to create new cells in the grid.

Overall Transformation:

To complete this task, you need to apply each instruction to the grid in turn until you reach the desired final state. This may involve modifying the grid's dimensions or creating new cells as needed.

Test Case Input/Output:

Here is an example of a test case:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Expected Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Explanation:

This input has been transformed from the initial state to the expected output using the instructions provided in the task description. In this case, we moved four pixels from their original position to a new position, changed the color of one group of pixels, combined two groups of pixels into a single group, and created three new cells in the grid.
