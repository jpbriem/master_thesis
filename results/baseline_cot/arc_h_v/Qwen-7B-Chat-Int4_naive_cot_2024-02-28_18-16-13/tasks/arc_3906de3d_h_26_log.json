            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

First, let's analyze the data structure of the input and output grids. Both inputs and outputs are square matrices of size N x N where each cell has a value from 0 to 9. The cells that are empty (value = 0) represent the background, while cells that contain a non-zero value represent a shape or object.\n  2. Next, we need to identify the underlying pattern that connects the input and output grids. In these examples, it appears that there is some kind of transformation happening where certain cells are copied or repeated, and others are modified or moved around.\n  3. To understand the specific rules behind this transformation, we need to look more closely at the details of the input and output grids. For example, in Example_1, we see that two adjacent cells are connected by a line of identical cells. This suggests that the transformation involves copying and pasting certain cells.\n  4. Similarly, in Example_2, we see that some cells are surrounded by a set of identical cells. This suggests that the transformation involves rotating or reflecting certain cells.\n  5. Based on our analysis so far, we can propose the following general steps for transforming the input grid into the output grid:\n\n    * Identify the objects in the input grid and their positions.\n    * Determine the transformation rule(s) that apply to each object.\n    * Apply the transformation rule(s) to each object.\n    * Repeat until all objects have been processed.\n\n  6. We can write a Python function that implements this algorithm using the NumPy library for matrix operations. Here's an example implementation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_matrix):\n    # Step 1: Identify objects and their positions\n    objects = []\n    for i in range(1, len(input_matrix)):\n        if np.allclose(input_matrix[i-1:i+2], [8, 8]):\n            objects.append((i-1, i))\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine transformation rule(s)\n    if len(objects) == 1:\n        # Example_1: Copy and paste\n        start_row, start_col = objects[0]\n        end_row, end_col = objects[0]\n        copy_matrix = input_matrix[start_row:end_row+1][start_col:end_col+1].reshape(-1, 2)\n        input_matrix[start_row:end_row+1][start_col:end_col+1] = copy_matrix\n    elif len(objects) == 2:\n        # Example_2: Rotate or reflect\n        pass\n    \n    # Step 3: Apply transformation rule(s)\n    # ...\n\n    return input_matrix\n```\n\nNote that this is just an example implementation and may not cover all possible cases. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, additional steps or modifications may be necessary."
