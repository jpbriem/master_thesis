prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
Task Description:
This problem requires you to identify specific geometric patterns in two-dimensional input arrays. The goal is to transform the input array so that it matches the desired output array. You will receive multiple inputs and outputs in JSON format, each describing a particular pattern transformation.
Instructions:

  * Analyze the input and output arrays provided.
  * Identify the geometric pattern present in both the input and output arrays.
  * Develop a function that transforms the input array according to the identified pattern.
  * Implement this function using any programming language of your choice.

Example Input:
```json
{
    "grid": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    "pattern": {
        "type": "horizontal",
        "direction": "left"
    }
}
```

Example Output:
```json
{
    "grid": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```

Note:
In this example, the input grid has no elements yet, but we know that the pattern is horizontal and moving leftward. Therefore, we can create an empty input grid that reflects this pattern.
Example Input:
```json
{
    "grid": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    "pattern": {
        "type": "vertical",
        "direction": "up"
    }
}
```

Example Output:
```json
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Note:
In this example, the input grid has no elements yet, but we know that the pattern is vertical and moving upwards. Therefore, we can create an empty input grid that reflects this pattern.
Example Input:
```json
{
    "grid": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    "pattern": {
        "type": "diagonal",
        "direction": "down-right"
    }
}
```

Example Output:
```json
[
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]
```

Note:
In this example, the input grid has no elements yet, but we know that the pattern is diagonal and moving downwards rightward. Therefore, we can create an empty input grid that reflects this pattern.
Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern is to understand the type of transformation required (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and the direction in which it should move (left, right, up, or down). Once these details are known, the function can be implemented accordingly to generate the desired output array.
