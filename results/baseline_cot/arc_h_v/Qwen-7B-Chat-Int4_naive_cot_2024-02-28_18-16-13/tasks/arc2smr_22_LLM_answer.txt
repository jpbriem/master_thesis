prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given input-output pairs share a common pattern where an object (in this case, a group of connected pixels) is transformed into another object by changing its color, size, and position. This transformation can be achieved through a combination of rotation, translation, and scaling operations. In general, these transformations preserve the overall structure of the image while altering its appearance.
In Example_1, we see that the input grid has two objects, each consisting of six pixels of the same color. The output grid also has two objects, but their sizes and positions have been changed. The second object has moved horizontally and vertically, and its size has increased. This indicates that the transformation has involved both translation and scaling operations.
Similarly, in Example_2, we see that the input grid has three objects, each consisting of six pixels of a different color. The output grid also has three objects, but their positions and sizes have been changed. The third object has moved horizontally and vertically, and its size has decreased. This indicates that the transformation has involved both translation and scaling operations.
Finally, in Example_3, we see that the input grid has four objects, each consisting of six pixels of a different color. The output grid also has four objects, but their positions and sizes have been changed. The fourth object has moved horizontally and vertically, and its size has increased. This indicates that the transformation has involved both translation and scaling operations.
Overall, the input-output pairs share a common pattern of transforming objects by applying translation, scaling, and rotation operations. The specific details of the transformations depend on the input data and the desired output.
