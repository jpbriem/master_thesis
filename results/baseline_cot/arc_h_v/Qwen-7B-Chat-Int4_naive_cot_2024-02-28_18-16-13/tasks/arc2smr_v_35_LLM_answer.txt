prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
This appears to be a description of a pattern recognition problem where certain objects need to be identified and transformed according to specific rules. To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

  1. Analyze the input and output examples to understand the underlying pattern.
  2. Define the necessary transformations that need to be applied to the input grid.
  3. Apply the defined transformations to the input grid to obtain the output grid.
  4. Write the solution in JSON format as per the instructions provided.

Let's start by analyzing the input/output examples:

Example_1: This seems to be an example of a simple rotation transformation. In the original input grid, there is a single object (a square) that needs to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees to obtain the final output grid. We can apply this transformation using Python's `numpy` library.

Example_2: This seems to be another rotation transformation, but with a slight difference. In the original input grid, there are two objects (two squares) that need to be rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. However, the second square has been moved to the top-left corner of the grid before applying the rotation. We can apply this transformation using `numpy`.

Example_3: This seems to be an example of a translation transformation. In the original input grid, there is a single object (a square) that needs to be translated horizontally by 3 units and vertically by 2 units to obtain the final output grid. We can apply this transformation using `numpy`.

Now let's define the necessary transformations:

  * For Example_1, we can create a function called `rotate_clockwise()` that takes a 2D numpy array as input and returns the rotated version of the array.
  * For Example_2, we can modify the `rotate_clockwise()` function to take multiple arguments, each representing a rotation angle and a translation vector, and return the transformed array.
  * For Example_3, we can create a function called `translate()` that takes a 2D numpy array and a tuple of translation coordinates as input and returns the translated version of the array.

Finally, we can write the solution in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "example_1_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "the object was rotated clockwise by 90 degrees",
        "object_changes": "one object was transformed"
    },
    "example_2_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "the two objects were both rotated clockwise by 90 degrees",
        "object_changes": "two objects were transformed"
    },
    "example_3_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "the object was translated horizontally by 3 units and vertically by 2 units",
        "object_changes": "one object was transformed"
    },
    "transformations": [
        {
            "function_name": "rotate_clockwise",
            "arguments": []
        },
        {
            "function_name": "rotate_clockwise",
            "arguments": ["90", [0, -3], [-2, 0]]
        },
        {
            "function_name": "translate",
            "arguments": [[0, 0], [3, 2]]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the above JSON format assumes that the input and output arrays are represented as 2D numpy arrays. If they are represented differently, the functions used to perform the transformations may need to be modified accordingly.
