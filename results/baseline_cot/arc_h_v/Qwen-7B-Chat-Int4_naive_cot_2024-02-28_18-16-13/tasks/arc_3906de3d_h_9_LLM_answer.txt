prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
This appears to be a series of image transformations where each image has been shifted and resized to create a new image. The goal seems to be to predict what the next image will look like given the current state of the images.
To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules that govern these transformations. Based on the provided information, it seems that the transformations involve moving and resizing objects within the images.
Here's an approach to solving this problem:

  1. Understand the rules of the transformation: From the provided examples, we can see that the transformations involve shifting and resizing objects within the images. We need to understand how this process works and what the rules are.
  2. Analyze the data: Once we understand the rules, we can analyze the data to identify any patterns or trends that may help us make predictions about future images.
  3. Develop a model: Based on our analysis, we can develop a machine learning model that can learn to predict the next image given the current state of the images. This could involve training the model using labeled data or using unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.
  4. Test the model: After developing the model, we can test it using a set of test cases to evaluate its performance and accuracy.
  5. Refine the model: If necessary, we can refine the model by adjusting its parameters or using additional data to improve its accuracy.

It's important to note that this is just one possible approach to solving this problem, and there may be other ways to achieve the desired results. Additionally, since the problem involves transforming images, it may require specialized tools or libraries to perform the necessary calculations.
