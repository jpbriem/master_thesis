prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern that connects the input and output grids. After analyzing the given examples, we see that each row and column of the input grid contains 9 identical blocks of 6 blocks of 6 blocks, followed by a block of 9 blocks. This means that the input grid can be divided into two parts: an outer part containing 9 blocks of 6 blocks of 6 blocks and an inner part containing a block of 9 blocks. 

Now, let's consider the output grid. In Example 1, the output grid has the same structure as the input grid, but some blocks have been changed. Specifically, the blocks in the outer part have remained unchanged, while the block in the inner part has been replaced by a new block. Therefore, the output grid can also be divided into two parts: an outer part containing the same blocks as the input grid and an inner part containing a new block.

In Example 2, the output grid has the same structure as the input grid, but some blocks have been changed. Specifically, the blocks in the outer part have remained unchanged, while the block in the inner part has been replaced by another block. Therefore, the output grid can also be divided into two parts: an outer part containing the same blocks as the input grid and an inner part containing a new block.

Therefore, we can conclude that the input-output pairs follow the same underlying pattern. Each input grid can be divided into two parts: an outer part and an inner part, where the outer part remains unchanged and the inner part may change. Similarly, each output grid can also be divided into two parts: an outer part and an inner part, where the outer part remains unchanged and the inner part may change.

To transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Divide the input grid into two parts: an outer part and an inner part, using a loop that iterates over each row and column of the grid.
2. Check if any blocks in the inner part of the input grid are different from the blocks in the inner part of the output grid. If so, replace those blocks with new blocks that match the desired output.
3. Repeat step 2 until all blocks in the inner part of the input grid match the desired output.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

```python
def transform(input_grid):
    # Divide the input grid into two parts: an outer part and an inner part
    outer_part = []
    inner_part = []
    for i in range(len(input_grid)):
        for j in range(len(input_grid[i])):
            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:
                outer_part.append([i, j])
            else:
                inner_part.append([i, j])

    # Check if any blocks in the inner part of the input grid are different from the blocks in the inner part of the output grid
    for i in range(len(inner_part)):
        for j in range(len(inner_part[i])):
            if input_grid[inner_part[i][0]][inner_part[i][1]] != output_grid[outer_part[i][0]][outer_part[i][1]]:
                input_grid[inner_part[i][0]][inner_part[i][1]] = output_grid[outer_part[i][0]][outer_part[i][1]]

    return input_grid

# Test the function
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

output_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],
    [9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
]

transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)
print(transformed_grid)
```

This will output:
