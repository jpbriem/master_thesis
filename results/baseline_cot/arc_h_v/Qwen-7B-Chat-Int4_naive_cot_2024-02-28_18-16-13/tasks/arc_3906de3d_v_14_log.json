            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0], [3, 1, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0], [1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe examples provided seem to follow a consistent pattern where each input matrix has some pixels that are either white (represented by 0) or black (represented by 1). The output matrices also contain the same number of rows and columns as the inputs but with some of the pixels changed from white to black or vice versa. The specific pixels that change depend on the specific rules governing the transformation.\nFor example, in Example_1, the top row and the last row remain unchanged, while the rest of the cells are inverted. In Example_2, the top row and bottom row are swapped, and the middle row is flipped vertically. In Example_3, the top row and bottom row are swapped, and the middle two rows are flipped horizontally.\nTo determine the exact pattern followed by the transformation, we need more information about the specific rules governing it. Without this information, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer.\nHowever, given the examples provided, it seems that the transformation involves some form of inversion or flipping of certain rows or columns of the input matrix. It could also involve some kind of rotation or reflection of the matrix.\nIn order to solve this problem, we would need to know the specific rules governing the transformation, such as whether it involves any particular axis or angle of rotation, or whether it affects certain types of objects or patterns in the matrix differently. Once we have this information, we can apply the appropriate mathematical operations to transform the input matrix into the desired output matrix."
