prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
output: [[3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'all pixels in the input grid changed to the corresponding value in the output grid', 'object_changes': 'no objects were found in either the input or output grid'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'all pixels in the input grid changed to the corresponding value in the output grid', 'object_changes': 'no objects were found in either the input or output grid'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'all pixels in the input grid changed to the corresponding value in the output grid', 'object_changes': 'no objects were found in either the input or output grid'}, 'overall_pattern': 'the input grid is divided into sub-grids that correspond to the positions of objects in the output grid. Each sub-grid contains an object with the same color as the corresponding pixel in the input grid. The size of each object corresponds to the number of pixels in the corresponding sub-grid.', 'instructions': 'for each object in the input grid, create a new sub-grid with the same color as the corresponding pixel in the input grid. then, increase the size of the sub-grid by one pixel in every direction until it encompasses the entire object. finally, copy the contents of the sub-grid to the corresponding position in the output grid.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, the first row represents the top-left corner of the input grid, the second row represents the top-right corner, and so on. the last row represents the bottom-right corner. each cell in the grid represents a pixel. the color of each pixel indicates the value it will take in the output grid.', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, no objects were found in either the input or output grid.', 'test_case_transformation': 'for each object in the input grid, create a new sub-grid with the same color as the corresponding pixel in the input grid. then, increase the size of the sub-grid by one pixel in every direction until it encompasses the entire object. finally, copy the contents of the sub-grid to the corresponding position in the output grid.', 'test_case_output': '[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]'}}
```css
[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
 [7, 0, 7, 7, 0],
 [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]
```

Note: In this example, the output grid has been created by increasing the size of each object by one pixel in every direction until it encompasses the entire object, and then copying the contents of the sub-grid to the corresponding position in the output grid. This process was applied to each object in the input grid, resulting in the output grid shown above.
