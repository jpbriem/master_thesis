            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given input-output pairs follow a consistent pattern where each row represents an object in the grid, and each column represents a pixel value in that object. Each pair describes two versions of the same grid, one where the objects have been transformed into their final positions, and another where the objects remain unchanged. The transformations appear to involve mirroring, rotation, translation, and scaling of the objects.\n\nFor example, in Example_1, the first input grid has three objects arranged in a line, while the second input grid shows these objects translated and scaled such that they form a triangle. In Example_2, the first input grid has four objects arranged in a square formation, while the second input grid shows these objects rotated and translated such that they form a rectangle.\n\nOverall pattern: The input-output pairs show a clear pattern of transforming objects in the grid using various geometric operations such as mirroring, rotation, translation, and scaling. This suggests that the transformation involves mapping a set of rules onto the grid's objects to generate the corresponding output grid.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the test case input grid into its test case output grid, you need to apply the same transformation rules used in the examples provided. Here are some general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input grid: Look for groups of pixels with the same color and shape. These are likely to represent objects in the grid.\n\n2. Apply the transformation rules: Use the geometric operations (mirroring, rotation, translation, and scaling) to move, resize, or rotate the objects in the grid.\n\n3. Repeat until all objects are transformed: Continue applying the transformation rules until no more objects are changed.\n\n4. Verify the output grid: Check that the output grid matches the expected output according to the test case description.\n\nNote that the specific transformation rules may vary depending on the input grid and the desired output. You will need to carefully read through the examples provided and adapt them to fit your needs."
