            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

Here's an algorithm to do so:\n\n1. Identify the geometric properties of the input grid such as shape, size, position, orientation, etc. This will help us understand what kind of transformation is needed.\n\n2. Identify the colors of the input grid and determine if they represent objects or background. If they represent objects, then it's likely that some sort of grouping operation needs to take place.\n\n3. Analyze the movements of the objects in the input grid to understand their relationships to each other. This may involve identifying common features such as lines, rectangles, or symmetries.\n\n4. Based on our understanding of the input grid, propose a set of possible transformations that could generate the output grid.\n\n5. Test these transformations on a small subset of the input grid to see if they produce the desired output.\n\n6. Iterate through the remaining steps until we find a solution that produces the correct output for all input grids.\n\n7. Once we've identified a solution, document it clearly and provide detailed instructions on how to apply it to any future inputs.\n\nAs for the specific input/output pairs provided, here's my attempt to analyze them:\n\nInput Example 1:\nThis input grid appears to be composed of two groups of colored squares arranged in a grid-like pattern. One group has three rows of four squares each, while the other has five rows of six squares each. Both groups appear to be rotated clockwise by 45 degrees relative to each other. The colors of the squares seem to indicate that they represent different objects, but without more information it's difficult to say exactly what those objects are or where they are located in the grid.\n\nOutput Example 1:\nThis output grid also appears to be composed of two groups of colored squares arranged in a grid-like pattern. However, there are several key differences between the two. First, the overall layout of the grid is flipped horizontally compared to the input grid. Second, the colors of the squares have been inverted (black becomes white and vice versa). Third, the sizes of the squares have been increased by a factor of two. Finally, the rotation angle of the grid seems to have changed slightly, although it's still unclear whether this is due to a change in the input grid or an artifact of the transformation process.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would suggest the following transformation steps to transform Input Example 1 into Output Example 1:\n\n1. Flip the input grid horizontally using a horizontal flip transformation.\n\n2. Invert the colors of each square in the input grid using a color inversion transformation.\n\n3. Increase the size of each square in the input grid by a factor of two using a scaling transformation.\n\n4. Rotate the input grid counter-clockwise by 45 degrees using a rotation transformation.\n\nIt's important to note that these transformations are just suggestions and may not necessarily produce the exact output shown in Output Example 1. Further experimentation and refinement may be necessary to achieve the desired result."
