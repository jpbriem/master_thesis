            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

There are no specific rules about the layout of the pixels other than that they form a square grid.\n\nThe output consists of the same 2D grid of pixels, but with some of the pixels replaced by others according to certain rules. In particular, there are two types of objects in the input: lines and objects made up of several connected pixels (called \"shapes\"). Each line or shape is assigned a unique integer value, which determines what pixel(s) it replaces in the output. \n\nFor example, in Example_1, the input grid contains five lines and three shapes, with the following assignments:\n\nLine 1: Replaces pixel [0, 1] with pixel [0, 2]\nLine 2: Replaces pixel [0, 2] with pixel [0, 3]\nShape 1: Replaces pixels [0, 4] and [0, 5] with pixel [0, 6]\nShape 2: Replaces pixels [1, 4] and [1, 5] with pixel [1, 6]\n\nIn Example_2, the input grid contains four lines and two shapes, with the following assignments:\n\nLine 1: Replaces pixel [0, 0] with pixel [0, 7]\nLine 2: Replaces pixel [1, 0] with pixel [1, 7]\nShape 1: Replaces pixels [2, 0] and [2, 1] with pixel [2, 8]\nShape 2: Replaces pixels [3, 0] and [3, 1] with pixel [3, 8]\n\nIn Example_3, the input grid contains six lines and one shape, with the following assignments:\n\nLine 1: Replaces pixel [0, 0] with pixel [0, 7]\nLine 2: Replaces pixel [1, 0] with pixel [1, 7]\nLine 3: Replaces pixel [2, 0] with pixel [2, 7]\nLine 4: Replaces pixel [3, 0] with pixel [3, 7]\nLine 5: Replaces pixel [4, 0] with pixel [4, 7]\nShape 1: Replaces pixels [5, 0] and [5, 1] with pixel [5, 8]\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThis transformation pattern involves replacing specific pixels in the input grid with new pixels according to certain rules. These rules specify which pixels to replace, and what pixels to replace them with. The resulting output grid will have the same overall structure as the input grid, but with some pixels replaced by others according to these rules.\n\nInstructions:\nTo create the output grid, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Iterate over each pixel in the input grid.\n  2. Check if the current pixel belongs to a line or a shape.\n  3. If the current pixel belongs to a line, check if it has been assigned a replacement pixel.\n  4. If the current pixel belongs to a shape, check if it has been assigned a replacement pixel.\n  5. Replace the current pixel with the assigned replacement pixel.\n\nNote that this process must be applied to every pixel in the input grid, including any pixels that were not touched by the input-output pairs provided. This means that you may need to iterate over the input grid multiple times, depending on the complexity of the input/output pairs."
