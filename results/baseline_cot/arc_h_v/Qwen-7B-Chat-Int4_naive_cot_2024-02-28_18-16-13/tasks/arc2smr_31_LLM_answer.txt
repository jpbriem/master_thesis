prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of each input-output pair. Here's an explanation of the pattern:

Input Grid: In Example_1, there are two objects - one of size 3 (represented by a blue square) and another of size 2 (represented by a yellow square). The objects are arranged such that they touch each other. In Example_2, there are two objects - one of size 5 (represented by a red square) and another of size 1 (represented by a green square). They are arranged such that they do not overlap but touch each other. 

Output Grid: In both examples, the output grid is created by copying the input grid and changing the color of some of the squares based on the objects' sizes. For Example_1, the yellow square has been replaced by a blue square. For Example_2, the green square has been replaced by a red square.

Based on this understanding, here's the solution:

Transform the input grid into the output grid by performing the following steps:

1. Identify the objects in the input grid based on their size and position. There will always be exactly one object of size 2 and one object of size 3.

2. Create a new empty grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

3. Replace the squares in the output grid that correspond to the positions of the objects in the input grid with the appropriate color. For Example_1, replace the yellow square with a blue square. For Example_2, replace the green square with a red square.

4. If necessary, repeat Step 3 until the output grid matches the desired output.

Overall Pattern: The overall pattern of the input-output relationships involves transforming an input grid based on the size and position of specific objects. This transformation creates a unique output grid for each set of input data.
