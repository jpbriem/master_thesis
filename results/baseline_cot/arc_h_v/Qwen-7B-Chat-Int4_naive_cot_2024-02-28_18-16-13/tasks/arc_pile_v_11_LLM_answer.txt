prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [8, 0, 9, 3, 0, 7], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [8, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [8, 6, 9, 3, 0, 7]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 6]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 3, 8, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 9, 7, 4], [0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4], [0, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4]]



Test case:
input: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]

Sample Outputs:
Example_1 description:
In this example, we see that the first two columns of the input grid are flipped horizontally and vertically, while the last four columns remain unchanged. This results in the output grid having the same structure but with each column flipped. In terms of objects, the same three objects exist in both the input and output grids, but their positions have changed due to the flipping operation.
Example_2 description:
This example shows an inversion operation where the input grid is reflected across the vertical axis, resulting in the output grid. There are no changes in the object's position or color.
Example_3 description:
This example shows a rotation operation where the input grid is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees. As a result, the output grid has the same structure as the input grid, but with each row flipped. No change was made to the object's position or color.
Overall pattern:
All three examples demonstrate the concept of geometric transformations, specifically horizontal and vertical flips (inversion) and clockwise rotations. These operations preserve the overall structure of the grid and do not affect the objects' position or color.
Instructions:
To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to apply the following steps:

  * Horizontal flip: Flip the columns of the input grid horizontally.
  * Vertical flip: Flip the rows of the input grid vertically.
  * Clockwise rotation: Rotate the input grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees.

Once you have applied these transformations, the resulting output grid should match the output grid provided in the examples.
Test case input copy:
[[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]
Test case grid view:
[[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]
Test case object view:
There are no objects present in the input grid.
Test case transformation:
Input: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]
Output: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]
Test case output:
[[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]
Note: Please note that the above solution assumes that the input grid contains integers ranging from 1 to 9, and that any pixel value other than 1 or 9 is considered noise.
