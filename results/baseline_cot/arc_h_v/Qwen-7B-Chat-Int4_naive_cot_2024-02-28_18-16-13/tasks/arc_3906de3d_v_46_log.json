            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 9, 9, 2, 9, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [2, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0], [2, 2, 9, 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 2, 2, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe given input-output pairs share a common transformation pattern that involves the following steps:\n\n  1. Take an initial input grid of n x n pixels, where each pixel has a value from 0 to 9.\n  2. Create a new grid of n x n pixels, where each pixel has the same value as its corresponding pixel in the original grid.\n  3. For every object in the original grid (i.e., any group of four consecutive pixels with the same value), duplicate it and place it in the new grid such that the center pixel of the duplicated object coincides with the center pixel of the original object.\n  4. Repeat this process until no more objects are found in the original grid.\n\nThis transformation results in a new grid that contains copies of all objects in the original grid, arranged such that they touch each other and form a regular pattern. The overall pattern is therefore determined by the arrangement of these copied objects.\n\nTo illustrate this pattern, let's consider the example inputs provided in the problem statement:\n\n  * Example 1: The original input grid consists of 10 rows and 10 columns, with each pixel having a value from 0 to 9. After applying the transformation, we get a new grid with the same dimensions, but with all pixels having the same value as their corresponding pixels in the original grid. We also see that the objects in the original grid have been duplicated and placed in the new grid according to the described pattern.\n  * Example 2: In this example, the original input grid consists of 10 rows and 10 columns, but some of the pixels have a value of 0 instead of 9. This means that there are no objects in this grid. After applying the transformation, we again get a new grid with the same dimensions, but with all pixels having the same value as their corresponding pixels in the original grid. Since there are no objects in the original grid, the new grid will also consist of a uniform grid of pixels.\n  * Example 3: In this example, the original input grid consists of 10 rows and 10 columns, but some of the pixels have a value of 0 instead of 9. This means that there are two objects in this grid, represented by the regions of 9s in the top left corner and bottom right corner. After applying the transformation, we again get a new grid with the same dimensions, but with all pixels having the same value as their corresponding pixels in the original grid. Since there are two objects in the original grid, the new grid will also contain two objects, but since they are touching each other, they will merge into a single object.\n\nOverall, the transformation pattern involves taking an initial input grid of n x n pixels, duplicating each object in the grid, and arranging them in a way that maintains the connectivity of the objects while forming a regular pattern."
