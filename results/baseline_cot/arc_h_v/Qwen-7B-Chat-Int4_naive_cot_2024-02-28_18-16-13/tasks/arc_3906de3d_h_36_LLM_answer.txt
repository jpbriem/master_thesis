prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The provided examples showcase two different types of transformations that can be applied to a grid:

  * Example_1: This transformation involves connecting objects that touch each other. In this example, there are four objects (each represented by a set of connected pixels) that touch each other. The input grid has 10 objects, but after applying the transformation, there are only six objects left. Each object has been split into smaller parts due to the connection between them.
  * Example_2: This transformation involves resizing objects. In this example, the input grid has five objects, but after applying the transformation, three of the objects have become larger while the other two have remained unchanged. The transformation has affected the size of the objects in the grid.

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern of these examples involves combining multiple transformation techniques to achieve specific results. For example, in Example_1, the transformation technique used is "connect objects touching each other", while in Example_2, the technique used is "resize objects". These techniques can be combined to create more complex transformations.

Instructions:
To apply the transformation described above, you will need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify the objects in the input grid by grouping pixels that represent the same object together.
  2. Connect objects that touch each other by joining their corresponding pixels together.
  3. Resize objects by changing their size based on a given formula or algorithm.
  4. Apply any necessary adjustments to the grid's layout to ensure that it remains consistent after the transformation.

Transformed Grid:
Based on the instructions provided, we can see that the input grid has been transformed into an output grid that has fewer objects and some of the existing objects have been resized. Here's the transformed grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Note that the objects in the output grid may appear slightly different than those in the input grid due to the effects of the transformation. However, they should still retain the general structure and appearance of the original objects.
