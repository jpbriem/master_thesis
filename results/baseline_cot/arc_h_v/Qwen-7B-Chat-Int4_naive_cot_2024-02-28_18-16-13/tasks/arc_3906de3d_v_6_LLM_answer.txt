prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The given examples demonstrate that the input grid is composed of connected groups of 9s that can be rotated, translated, and scaled to form the desired output grid. In Example_1, the input grid has two such groups of 9s, while in Example_2 there is only one group of 9s. 

In Example_3, the input grid consists of four smaller groups of 9s, each of which can be independently transformed to produce the desired output grid.

To create the output grid, we need to apply the appropriate transformation to each group of 9s. For instance, in Example_1, we can rotate the top-left group of 9s counterclockwise by 90 degrees and then translate it down by 9 units to obtain the desired output grid. Similarly, in Example_3, we can scale each group of 9s by a factor of 2 horizontally and vertically and translate them up by 6 units to achieve the desired result.

Once we have applied these transformations to each group of 9s, we can concatenate them horizontally to form the final output grid.

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern involves applying specific transformations to each group of 9s to form the desired output grid. These transformations include rotation, translation, scaling, and combinations of these operations.

Instructions:
To solve this problem, you will need to follow the instructions provided in each example and determine the appropriate transformation to apply to each group of 9s. Once you have determined the transformations, you can apply them using mathematical functions or programming libraries to generate the output grid.

Here are some general steps you can follow:

1. Identify the groups of 9s in the input grid.
2. Determine the desired orientation and position of each group of 9s in the output grid.
3. Apply the appropriate transformation to each group of 9s to form the desired output grid.
4. Concatenate the transformed groups horizontally to form the final output grid.

Overall Test Case Input:
Here is an example input grid:
```css
[[0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 4, 9, 4, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0],
 [0, 4, 9, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
```

This input grid consists of five groups of 9s arranged in a 5x5 grid. We want to transform this input grid into a new output grid where the top-left group of 9s is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees and translated down by 9 units, the middle group of 9s is translated up by 6 units, and the bottom-right group of 9s is scaled horizontally by a factor of 2 and vertically by a factor of 2.

We can use the above instructions to determine the appropriate transformations to apply to each group of 9s and generate the output grid.
