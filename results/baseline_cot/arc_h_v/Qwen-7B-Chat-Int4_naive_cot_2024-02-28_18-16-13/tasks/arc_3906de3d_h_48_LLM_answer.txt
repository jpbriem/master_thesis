prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern of the given input-output pairs. From the examples provided, it seems that each pair has a specific sequence of operations applied to an initial set of pixels. These operations include translation, rotation, scaling, and merging of objects.
We can use the concept of geometric transformations to analyze these patterns. Geometric transformations are mathematical operations that change the position, orientation, scale, and other properties of a point, line, plane, or solid figure. They are commonly used in computer graphics, image processing, and robotics applications.
Based on the examples provided, we can see that the transformations involve moving, rotating, and scaling objects within the grid. In some cases, objects are merged together, while in others, they are separated. It appears that there is no fixed rule for how the objects are transformed, but rather, the rules depend on the specific input-output pair.
In order to transform the test case input grid into its test output grid, we would need to apply the same sequence of operations to the input grid as was applied to the examples provided. This may require understanding the underlying structure of the input grid and identifying the relevant objects and their relationships to each other.
Once we have identified the relevant objects and their relationships, we can apply the appropriate transformations to move, rotate, scale, and merge them according to the rules described above. We would then need to verify that our solution produces the correct output grid by comparing it to the test output grid provided in the prompt.
Overall, solving this problem requires a combination of knowledge in computer graphics, image processing, and mathematics. It will likely involve analyzing the input-output pairs closely, identifying the relevant objects and their relationships, and applying the appropriate transformations to produce the desired output grid.
