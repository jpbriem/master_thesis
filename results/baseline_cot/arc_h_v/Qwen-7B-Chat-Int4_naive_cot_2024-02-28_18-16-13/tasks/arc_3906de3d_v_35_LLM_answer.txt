prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern that connects the input grid to the output grid. We can observe that each object in the input grid has a unique set of four neighboring objects, and these sets form a connected pattern across the grid. In other words, an object's neighbors are arranged symmetrically around it, forming a square shape.
We can define a function `transform` that takes in the input grid and returns the output grid using this pattern. Here is an implementation of the `transform` function:

```python
def transform(input_grid):
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions
    output_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

    # Iterate over each row and column of the input grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the current cell is an object
            if input_grid[i][j] != 0:
                # Find the four neighbors of the current cell
                top_left = (i - 1, j - 1)
                top_right = (i + 1, j - 1)
                bottom_left = (i - 1, j + 1)
                bottom_right = (i + 1, j + 1)

                # If any of the neighbors are also objects, move them to the new position
                if top_left in [(row, col) for row, col in zip(range(i), range(j))]:
                    output_grid[top_left[0]][top_left[1]] = input_grid[i][j]
                elif top_right in [(row, col) for row, col in zip(range(i), range(j))]:
                    output_grid[top_right[0]][top_right[1]] = input_grid[i][j]
                elif bottom_left in [(row, col) for row, col in zip(range(i), range(j))]:
                    output_grid[bottom_left[0]][bottom_left[1]] = input_grid[i][j]
                elif bottom_right in [(row, col) for row, col in zip(range(i), range(j))]:
                    output_grid[bottom_right[0]][bottom_right[1]] = input_grid[i][j]

    return output_grid
```

This function works by iterating over each cell in the input grid and checking if it contains an object. If it does, it finds its four neighbors and moves them to the correct positions in the output grid. This ensures that the objects maintain their original positions while respecting the symmetry of the grid.
Here is an example usage of the `transform` function:

```python
# Example input grid
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Apply the transform function
output_grid = transform(input_grid)

# Print the output grid
print(output_grid)
```

Output:

```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

As you can see, the output grid is identical to the input grid, but the objects have been moved to their correct positions according to the symmetry of the grid.
