prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the input-output pattern. Based on the given examples, it seems that each input matrix corresponds to an image where each pixel has four possible values: 0 (black), 2 (blue), 7 (red) and 2 (blue). The value of a pixel depends on its neighbors and their respective values.
In Example_1, the input matrix consists of 6 rows and 8 columns, and the output matrix also consists of 6 rows and 8 columns. Each row of the input matrix represents a horizontal line of pixels, and each column represents a vertical line of pixels. The output matrix shows the same structure but with some pixels replaced with their new values after applying certain operations.
In Example_2, the input matrix consists of 6 rows and 8 columns, and the output matrix also consists of 6 rows and 8 columns. However, the structure of the two matrices is different. In the input matrix, there are some black pixels surrounded by blue pixels, while in the output matrix, these black pixels have been replaced with red pixels.
In Example_3, the input matrix consists of 6 rows and 8 columns, and the output matrix also consists of 6 rows and 8 columns. However, the structure of the two matrices is again different. In the input matrix, there are some blue pixels surrounded by white pixels, while in the output matrix, these blue pixels have been replaced with red pixels.
Therefore, the solution to this problem involves understanding the pattern of replacing specific pixel values based on their neighbors' values. We need to define a function that takes in an input matrix, applies the necessary operations to replace the specified pixel values, and returns the updated output matrix. This will involve defining rules for when to replace a pixel's value and what value to replace it with based on its neighbors' values.
