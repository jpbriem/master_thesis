            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

This can involve horizontal and vertical shifts, scaling factors, and rotation angles. Additionally, some objects may be translated or moved relative to their original positions.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the shift amounts in both directions (horizontal and vertical) for each object in the input grid. These shift amounts will determine how much the object needs to be moved to fit correctly in the output grid.\n2. Calculate the new position of each object in the output grid using the shift amounts identified in step 1. Make sure to take into account any scaling factors that were applied.\n3. Apply the shift amounts and scaling factors to the input grid to create the transformed output grid.\n4. If necessary, rotate the output grid around its center point using the specified rotation angle.\n\nObject Changes:\n\nObjects in the input grid typically represent shapes made up of multiple pixels. In the output grid, these objects will also be represented by shapes made up of multiple pixels, but they may be resized, rotated, translated, or moved according to the transformation rules described above.\n\nCounting:\n\nCounting the number of pixels in the input and output grids can help confirm whether the transformation was successful. For example, if the total number of pixels in the input grid does not match the total number of pixels in the output grid, there may be errors in the transformation process.\n\nSorting:\n\nThere is no need to sort the input or output grids in this particular example, as the transformation does not involve sorting or rearranging objects.\n\nCopy and Repeat:\n\nThere is no need to copy or repeat objects in this particular example, as the transformation does not involve copying or repeating objects.\n\nPattern-based and Mosaic-Based Solutions:\n\nThis transformation does not involve applying pattern-based or mosaic-based solutions.\n\nOverall Transformation:\n\nFor Example 1, we can apply the following transformation to move the object to the right by two pixels while keeping its size unchanged:\n\n```css\nshift horizontally: -2\n\ntransformed output:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nFor Example 2, we can apply the following transformation to scale the object vertically by a factor of 2 while keeping its position unchanged:\n\n```scss\nscale vertically: 2\n\ntransformed output:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nFor Example 3, we can apply the following transformation to translate the object horizontally by three pixels while keeping its size unchanged:\n\n```javascript\ntranslate horizontally: 3\n\ntransformed output:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```"
