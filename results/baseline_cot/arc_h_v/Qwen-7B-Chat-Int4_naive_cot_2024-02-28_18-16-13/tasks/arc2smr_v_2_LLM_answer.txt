prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the underlying pattern of the input-output pairs. From the given examples, it appears that each pair consists of an input grid where some of the cells contain values other than 0 (objects), and an output grid where the objects have been transformed in some way. The specific transformation depends on the values of the objects in the input grid.
In order to transform the input grid into the output grid, we need to identify the objects in the input grid and apply the appropriate transformation to them. We also need to ensure that no new objects are created out of thin air, and that no existing objects are removed or modified.
Here's a possible solution:

  1. Identify the objects in the input grid: To do this, we need to look for regions in the input grid that contain consecutive non-zero values. These regions represent the objects.
  2. Apply the transformation: Once we have identified the objects, we need to apply the appropriate transformation to them. For example, if the objects are squares and we want to turn them into triangles, we would replace every square with three connected triangles.
  3. Update the output grid: After applying the transformation, we need to update the output grid accordingly. This means replacing the old object values with the new ones.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the output grid matches the expected output.

This solution assumes that the input and output grids have the same dimensions, and that the objects in the input grid can be represented as simple geometric shapes. In practice, the solution may need to be adapted depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
As for the overall pattern, it seems that the input-output pairs follow a common rule where the input grid contains objects that are transformed into the output grid in a certain way. However, without more information about the specific rules governing the transformations, it's difficult to say exactly what the overall pattern is.
