            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

This means that if we take an input grid and apply this transformation, it will produce an output grid where each pixel has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees and then mirrored vertically. For example, if we start with the input grid:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\nand apply this transformation, we get the output grid:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\nNote that the top row has become the bottom row, and the rightmost column has become the leftmost column.\nThis transformation pattern is related to the overall grid structure, as it involves rotating and mirroring the grid's orientation. It is also related to the objects in the grid, as any object that was initially horizontal will now appear vertical after the transformation. However, since there are no specific rules provided for the input and output grid, it is difficult to provide more information about the pattern without additional context.\nIn terms of the instructions, the transformation could be described as follows:\n\n  * Rotate the input grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees using matrix multiplication or other mathematical operations.\n  * Mirror the resulting rotated grid vertically using another set of matrix multiplication or other mathematical operations.\n\nTo create the output grid as a numpy array, you can follow these steps:\n\n  1. Define the input grid as a numpy array with appropriate dimensions (e.g., 2D).\n  2. Apply the rotation operation using matrix multiplication or other mathematical operations to obtain the rotated grid.\n  3. Apply the mirroring operation using another set of matrix multiplication or other mathematical operations to obtain the final output grid.\n  4. Save the output grid as a numpy array.\n\nFor example, if the input grid is represented as a 2D numpy array `grid`, the following code would perform the necessary transformations and save the output grid as `output`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the input grid\ngrid = ...\n\n# Perform the rotation operation\nrotated_grid = np.rot90(grid)\n\n# Perform the mirroring operation\nmirrored_grid = np.fliplr(rotated_grid)\n\n# Save the output grid\noutput = mirrored_grid\n```\n\nIt is important to note that this is just one possible implementation of the transformation pattern, and there may be other ways to achieve the desired results depending on the specific requirements of the problem."
