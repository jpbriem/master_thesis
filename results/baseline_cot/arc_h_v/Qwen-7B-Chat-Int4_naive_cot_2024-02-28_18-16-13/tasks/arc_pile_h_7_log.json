            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9]]\noutput: [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 5], [7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [4, 0, 4, 0, 4]]\noutput: [[6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 9], [8, 0, 8, 8], [1, 1, 0, 1], [7, 0, 7, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nExample 1 describes an example of a pattern that involves changing the value of certain pixels to their opposite (i.e., flipping them). This pattern is applied to each row individually, so the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid but with the values flipped horizontally. For example, the pixel at position [0,0] in the input grid becomes the pixel at position [0,0] in the output grid, while the pixel at position [1,1] in the input grid becomes the pixel at position [1,1] in the output grid, and so on.\nExample 2 describes a pattern that involves copying a section of the input grid onto itself. Specifically, the pattern copies the top-left quarter of the input grid onto the bottom-right quarter of the output grid. In other words, the pixels at positions [0,0], [0,1], [1,1], and [1,2] in the input grid become the pixels at positions [0,0], [0,1], [1,1], and [1,2] in the output grid, respectively.\nExample 3 describes a pattern that involves scaling the input grid vertically by a factor of two. Specifically, the pattern doubles the height of the input grid and leaves the width unchanged. In other words, the pixels at positions [0,0], [0,1], [0,2], and [0,3] in the input grid become the pixels at positions [0,0], [0,2], [0,4], and [0,6] in the output grid, respectively.\nOverall Pattern: The overall pattern described by these three examples is one of applying simple geometric transformations to the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid.\nInstructions:\n\n  * Flip the input grid horizontally to obtain the output grid.\n  * Copy the top-left quarter of the input grid onto the bottom-right quarter of the output grid.\n  * Scale the input grid vertically by a factor of two to obtain the output grid.\n\nTest Case Input Copy:\n```css\n[[0, 0, 9, 9],\n [8, 0, 8, 8],\n [1, 1, 0, 1],\n [7, 0, 7, 0]]\n```\n\nTest Case Grid View:\n```scss\n[ [0, 0, 9, 9], [8, 0, 8, 8], [1, 1, 0, 1], [7, 0, 7, 0] ]\n```\n\nTest Case Object View:\n```yaml\n[\n    {\n        \"color\": \"9\",\n        \"coordinates\": [[0, 0]],\n        \"size\": 4,\n        \"shape\": \"rectangle\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"color\": \"8\",\n        \"coordinates\": [[0, 1]],\n        \"size\": 4,\n        \"shape\": \"rectangle\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"color\": \"1\",\n        \"coordinates\": [[0, 2]],\n        \"size\": 4,\n        \"shape\": \"rectangle\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"color\": \"7\",\n        \"coordinates\": [[0, 3]],\n        \"size\": 4,\n        \"shape\": \"rectangle\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nTest Case Transformation:\nFlip the input grid horizontally to obtain the output grid.\nCopy the top-left quarter of the input grid onto the bottom-right quarter of the output grid.\nScale the input grid vertically by a factor of two to obtain the output grid.\n\nTest Case Output:\n```python\n[[0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8],\n [1, 1, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 7]]\n```"
