            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 6, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 0], [0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 2, 6, 6, 2, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe provided examples demonstrate a pattern where an image undergoes a transformation that involves changing the value of certain pixels while maintaining the overall structure of the image. In other words, the pattern consists of transforming each pixel based on its neighbors to create new images.\nTo understand this pattern further, we need to consider two key aspects:\n\n  1. Pixel Changes: Each example demonstrates how specific pixels change during the transformation process. For instance, in Example 1, some pixels are changed from 0 to 2, while others remain unchanged. Similarly, in Example 2, some pixels are changed from 0 to 6, and in Example 3, some pixels are changed from 0 to 6. These changes are often related to the presence or absence of neighboring pixels with a specific color.\n  2. Object Changes: Each example also demonstrates how objects within the image change during the transformation process. For instance, in Example 1, there are four objects (two squares and two circles) present in the initial image. However, after the transformation, these objects may move, resize, or even disappear entirely. In Example 2, there are six objects present in the initial image, but after the transformation, some objects may merge or split, while others may appear or disappear altogether.\n\nOverall, the pattern demonstrated in these examples involves transforming individual pixels and objects within the image to create new images with unique characteristics. This process typically requires knowledge of both the underlying structure of the image and the desired outcome."
