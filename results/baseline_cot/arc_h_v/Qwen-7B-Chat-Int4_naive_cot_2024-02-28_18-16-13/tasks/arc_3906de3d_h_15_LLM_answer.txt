prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
The provided examples demonstrate a pattern where an input grid of 1s and 0s undergoes certain transformations to produce an output grid of 3s, 0s, and 6s. The transformation appears to involve rotations, translations, and mirroring of certain regions of the grid.
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the input-output relationships and determine the rules that govern these transformations. Here's a possible solution:

  1. Start by identifying the basic blocks of the input grid. These could be groups of identical pixels arranged in specific configurations, such as vertical lines, horizontal lines, or squares.
  2. Next, identify the transformations that occur between the input and output grids. For instance, it seems like some pixels are flipped horizontally or vertically, while others are moved around or combined with other pixels.
  3. Use mathematical operations to describe the transformations in terms of translations, rotations, scaling, and mirroring. This will help us understand how the input grid is being transformed into the output grid.
  4. Once you've described the transformations, apply them to the input grid using Python code. You'll need to write functions that perform each type of transformation and then combine them to create the final output grid.

Here's an example implementation of this approach:

```python
def flip_horizontally(grid):
    return grid[::-1]

def rotate_left(grid):
    return np.rot90(grid)

def rotate_right(grid):
    return np.rot90(grid, k=2)

def scale_down(grid):
    # TODO: Implement scaling operation

def mirror_vertically(grid):
    return np.fliplr(grid)

def mirror_diagonally(grid):
    # TODO: Implement diagonal mirroring operation

def translate_up(grid):
    # TODO: Implement translation operation

def translate_down(grid):
    # TODO: Implement translation operation

def translate_left(grid):
    # TODO: Implement translation operation

def translate_right(grid):
    # TODO: Implement translation operation

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()
    
    # Flip horizontally
    output_grid = flip_horizontally(output_grid)
    
    # Rotate left
    output_grid = rotate_left(output_grid)
    
    # Rotate right
    output_grid = rotate_right(output_grid)
    
    # Scale down
    # output_grid = scale_down(output_grid)
    
    # Mirror vertically
    output_grid = mirror_vertically(output_grid)
    
    # Mirror diagonally
    # output_grid = mirror_diagonally(output_grid)
    
    # Translate up
    # output_grid = translate_up(output_grid)
    
    # Translate down
    # output_grid = translate_down(output_grid)
    
    # Translate left
    # output_grid = translate_left(output_grid)
    
    # Translate right
    # output_grid = translate_right(output_grid)
    
    return output_grid
```

This function takes an input grid as a parameter and returns the transformed output grid. Note that this is just one possible implementation; there may be multiple ways to achieve the desired results depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
