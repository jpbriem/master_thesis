prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]]

Sample Outputs:
Overall Pattern:

All three examples follow a common pattern where each pixel value in the input grid corresponds to a specific value in the output grid. The mapping between the two grids is determined by their geometric relationships, such as rotation, translation, and scaling. In each example, the output grid contains a subset of the pixels from the input grid, but with some modifications that reflect the transformation applied to the original grid.

Instructions:

To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to apply the transformation rules outlined above. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what needs to be done:

1. Iterate over each row and column in the input grid.
2. For each pixel, check if it has been modified in the output grid.
3. If the pixel has been modified, determine its new value based on the transformation rules.
4. If the pixel has not been modified, keep its value from the input grid.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for every pixel in both the input and output grids.

For Example 1:

Input Grid:
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output Grid:
[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Test Case:

Input Grid:
[[0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]]
Output Grid:
[[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Description:

This transformation takes an input grid with six rows and six columns, and outputs another grid with the same dimensions. However, the values in the output grid are derived from the values in the input grid through certain rules. Specifically, each pixel in the output grid is assigned a value based on the value of the corresponding pixel in the input grid, modulo 10. This means that any value in the input grid less than or equal to 9 will be mapped to a value in the output grid less than or equal to 9, while any value greater than 9 will be mapped to 0 in the output grid. Additionally, any value in the input grid that is divisible by 7 will also be mapped to 0 in the output grid. Finally, any value in the input grid that is equal to 7 will be mapped to 9
