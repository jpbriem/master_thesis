prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 9], [7, 0, 2, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 4], [8, 0, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4]]



Test case:
input: [[7, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the pixel values have been inverted (0 becomes 9, 9 becomes 0)', 'object_changes': 'no change in object properties'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'the pixels have been flipped horizontally', 'object_changes': 'no change in object properties'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'all pixels have been set to 0 except for those in the corners', 'object_changes': 'no change in object properties'}, 'overall_pattern': 'in each example, the input grid has been transformed such that every pixel value is inverted or flipped horizontally or set to 0 except for those in the corners.', 'instructions': 'flip horizontally, invert pixel values, set all other pixels to 0', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[7, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'flip horizontally, invert pixel values, set all other pixels to 0', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}
```css
import numpy as np

def transform(input):
    # Flip horizontally
    input = np.fliplr(input)
    
    # Invert pixel values
    input = np.invert(input)
    
    # Set all other pixels to 0
    input[input != 0] = 0
    
    return input

input = np.array([[7, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]])
output = transform(input)

print("Input:")
print(input)
print()

print("Output:")
print(output)
```

This code defines a function `transform` that takes an input matrix and applies the three steps described in the instructions:

  * Flipping horizontally: This is done using the NumPy function `np.fliplr()`, which flips the rows of the matrix.
  * Inverting pixel values: This is done using the NumPy function `np.invert()`, which inverts the sign of all elements in the matrix.
  * Setting all other pixels to 0: This is done using an if statement that checks whether the element is non-zero and sets it to 0 if it is.

The `transform` function returns the modified input matrix as a NumPy array. Finally, we print both the input and output matrices to verify that the transformation was correctly applied.
