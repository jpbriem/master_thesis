prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 5]]
output: [[3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
Example 1 description:
The pixel changes involve replacing some 0s with 1s and vice versa. In terms of object changes, there are no changes since the objects remain the same but their colors change due to the replacement of 0s with 1s.
Overall pattern:
The overall pattern involves transforming an input grid where each pixel has a value of either 0 or 1 into an output grid where each pixel has a value of either 0 or 1. This transformation may involve replacing certain 0s with 1s and vice versa, depending on the specific implementation of the algorithm.
Instructions:

  * Iterate through each row and column of the input grid.
  * For each pixel, check if it is currently equal to 0 (i.e., it needs to be changed).
  * If the pixel is currently equal to 0, replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it unchanged.
  * Repeat this process for each pixel in the input grid until you have iterated over every pixel.

Test case input copy:
[[9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]

Test case grid view:
[9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [5, 0, 5, 5, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0]

Test case object view:
There are no objects in the given input grid, so there are no changes in object numbers or coordinates.

Test case transformation:
Replace each 0 with 1 in the input grid to obtain the output grid.

Test case output:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0]]
