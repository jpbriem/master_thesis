prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
Here's an explanation of the overall pattern:

The given inputs and outputs seem to involve transforming a grid of pixels from one state to another based on certain rules. In each example, the grid starts off with a set of identical squares (i.e., the value of each cell is always the same) and then transforms into a new configuration where the cells change their values or positions. 

In Example 1, we see that the input grid has 10 rows and 10 columns, and each cell contains the value 9 initially. After transformation, some cells change their value to 4 while others remain unchanged. This suggests that the transformation involves comparing the current state of the grid with a target state, and updating the cells accordingly.

In Example 2, the input grid also has 10 rows and 10 columns, but now each cell contains a different value. Specifically, the first row consists entirely of the value 9, followed by 8 rows of alternating 9s and 0s, and finally the last row containing only the value 0. After transformation, the grid becomes completely filled with the value 9. This suggests that the transformation involves iterating through the grid and changing the value of each cell to match the desired target state.

In Example 3, the input grid again has 10 rows and 10 columns, but this time it consists of a combination of 9s and 0s arranged in a checkerboard pattern. After transformation, some cells change their value while others remain unchanged, but the final result is that the entire grid is filled with the value 0. This suggests that the transformation involves identifying patterns in the input grid and applying specific updates to the cells accordingly.

Overall, the pattern seems to involve comparing the current state of the grid with a target state, and updating the cells accordingly based on a set of predefined rules. However, without more information about the specific rules used for each transformation, it's difficult to provide a more detailed description of the overall pattern.
