prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

Sample Outputs:
The given examples demonstrate a pattern where an object (in this case, a group of four identical squares) is transformed into another object (also a group of four identical squares) through a series of operations that involve changing the position, rotation, and size of each square.
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

  1. Identify the object(s) in the input grid and their properties (position, rotation, size).
  2. Determine the desired final state of the object(s), including their new position, rotation, and size.
  3. Apply the necessary transformations to move and resize the object(s) to their desired location.

Here's a detailed explanation of how to apply these steps to the provided test case:

  * Step 1: Identify the object(s)
    In this test case, there is only one object: a group of four identical squares arranged in a rectangle. Their position is fixed, but their rotation and size can change.
  * Step 2: Determine the desired final state of the object(s)
    We want to transform the object so that it appears in the center of the grid, rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees, and resized such that each square has a width of 4 units and a height of 4 units.
  * Step 3: Apply the necessary transformations

  * To rotate the object counterclockwise by 90 degrees, we can swap the positions of the top two rows and bottom two rows of the object. This will cause the object to appear flipped horizontally.
  * To resize the object to have a width of 4 units and a height of 4 units, we can scale each square by dividing its current dimensions by 2. After applying this transformation, each square will have a width of 2 units and a height of 2 units.

Applying these transformations to the input grid results in the following output grid:
```css
[[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

As you can see, the input grid has been transformed into the desired output grid using the specified transformations.
