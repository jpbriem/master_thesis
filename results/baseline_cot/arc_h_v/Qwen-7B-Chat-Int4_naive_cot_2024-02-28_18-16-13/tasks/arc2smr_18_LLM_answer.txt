prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
The provided examples show a pattern where an object (a group of pixels) is moved along a line or curve, either horizontally or vertically. The starting position of the object is fixed, but its end position depends on the value of another pixel in the grid.
To solve this problem, we need to define some rules:

  * The object starts at the top-left corner of the grid and ends at the bottom-right corner.
  * If the object encounters a pixel with a certain value, it moves in a specific direction (left, right, up, down).
  * If the object reaches the edge of the grid, it wraps around and continues moving in the opposite direction.
  * If the object hits any other object while moving, it stops and stays in place until the other object is removed.

Based on these rules, we can create a function that takes in the input grid and returns the output grid. Here's an implementation in Python:
```python
def move_objects(grid):
    # Define constants
    LEFT = -1
    RIGHT = 1
    UP = -1
    DOWN = 1

    # Create a dictionary to store the objects
    objects = {}

    # Iterate over each row and column
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0:
                # Find the current object
                obj = objects.get((i, j), None)
                if obj is None:
                    # Create a new object
                    obj = {
                        'start': (i, j),
                        'end': (i, j),
                        'direction': LEFT,
                        'value': grid[i][j],
                        'objects': []
                    }
                    objects[(i, j)] = obj
                else:
                    # Check if the object has reached the end
                    if obj['end'][0] == len(grid)-1 and obj['end'][1] == len(grid[0])-1:
                        break
                    elif obj['end'][0] < 0 or obj['end'][0] >= len(grid) or obj['end'][1] < 0 or obj['end'][1] >= len(grid[0]):
                        obj['direction'] *= -1
                    # Move the object according to its direction
                    obj['end'] += obj['direction']
                    if obj['end'][0] > 0 and grid[obj['end'][0]-1][obj['end'][1]] == obj['value']:
                        obj['direction'] = LEFT
                    elif obj['end'][0] < len(grid)-1 and grid[obj['end'][0]+1][obj['end'][1]] == obj['value']:
                        obj['direction'] = RIGHT
                    elif obj['end'][1] > 0 and grid[obj['end'][0]][obj['end'][1]-1] == obj['value']:
                        obj['direction'] = UP
                    elif obj['end'][1] < len(grid[0])-1 and grid[obj['end'][0]][obj['end'][1]+1] == obj['value']:
                        obj['direction'] = DOWN
                    # Add the new location to the object's history
                    obj['history'].append(obj['end'])
                    # Remove the object if it hits another object
                    for other_obj in objects.values():
                        if other_obj != obj and \
                           other_obj['start'] == obj['end'] or \
                           other_obj['end'] == obj['start']:
                            del objects[(other_obj['start'][0], other_obj['start'][1])]
                            break

    # Create a new grid to store the final result
    output = [[0 for _ in range(len(grid))]

```

This function creates a dictionary to store the objects in the input grid. It then iterates over each row and column, checking if there are any non-zero pixels. If there are, it finds the current object and checks if it has reached the end. If it has, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates the object's direction and moves it accordingly. If the object hits another object, it removes the other object from the dictionary. Finally, it creates a new grid to store the final result. Note that this implementation assumes that the input grid is square and has a height and width of at least two.
