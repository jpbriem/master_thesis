            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9], [3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0], [3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nThe three examples provided demonstrate a consistent pattern where each pair of input/output arrays has the same structure but the content differs based on certain conditions. In this case, the condition appears to be the presence or absence of specific objects in the input grid.\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the objects in the input grid and determine how they change across the input/output pairs. Once we understand the rules governing these transformations, we can apply them to new input grids to generate their corresponding output grids.\nLet's break down the steps needed to approach this problem:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input grid: We can do this by looking for regions in the grid that contain only a single color and no other objects. These regions correspond to individual objects in the grid.\n  2. Determine the transformation rules: For each object identified in step 1, we need to determine how it transforms across the input/output pairs. This may involve examining the positions of the object in both the input and output grids and determining if there are any movements or rotations involved.\n  3. Apply the transformation rules: Using the information gathered in steps 1 and 2, we can apply the transformation rules to new input grids to generate their corresponding output grids.\n\nOnce we've completed these steps, we will have a set of instructions that can be used to transform any given input grid into its corresponding output grid using the same transformation rules applied to the input/output pairs provided."
