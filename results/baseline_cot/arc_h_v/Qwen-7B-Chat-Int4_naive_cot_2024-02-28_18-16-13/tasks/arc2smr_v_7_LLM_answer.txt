prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the given transformation rules:

  * Each pixel in the input grid can be either 0 or 6 (black or white).
  * There is no change in the number of pixels per row or column.
  * Each object is represented by a group of connected pixels that have the same value (either 0 or 6) and have a minimum area of 3x3 pixels.
  * An object can touch another object if they share a border (i.e., have a non-zero distance of less than 2 pixels).

Based on these rules, here's an algorithm to solve the problem:

  1. Define a function called `find_objects` that takes the input grid as input and returns a list of objects. This function will iterate through each pixel in the grid and check if it belongs to an existing object or creates a new object.
    * If the current pixel has the same value as the previous pixel, it means that the pixel is part of an existing object. In this case, increment the count of the object.
    * If the current pixel has a different value than the previous pixel, it means that a new object needs to be created. Create a new object with the current pixel as its center.
  2. Define a function called `transform` that takes the input grid and the desired output grid as inputs and applies the transformation rules to the input grid to obtain the output grid. This function will apply the following steps:
    * Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
      * For each pixel, call the `find_objects` function to find any objects that overlap with the current pixel.
        * If there are objects that overlap with the current pixel, update their positions according to the transformation rules.
        * If there are no objects that overlap with the current pixel, create a new object with the current pixel as its center.
      * Apply the appropriate transformation rule to the current pixel depending on whether it belongs to an existing object or a new object.
        * If the current pixel belongs to an existing object, set its value to the average of the neighboring pixels' values.
        * If the current pixel belongs to a new object, set its value to the maximum of the neighboring pixels' values.
  3. Call the `transform` function on the input grid and print the resulting output grid.

Here's the Python code implementation of the above algorithm:

```python
def find_objects(grid):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store objects
    objects = {}
    
    # Iterate through each pixel in the grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            # Check if the current pixel belongs to an existing object
            if (i, j) in objects:
                # Increment the count of the object
                objects[(i, j)].count += 1
                
            # Check if the current pixel creates a new object
            else:
                # Create a new object with the current pixel as its center
                objects[(i, j)] = {"center": (i, j), "count": 1}
                
    return objects

def transform(input_grid, output_grid):
    # Iterate through each pixel in the input grid
    for i in range(len(input_grid)):
        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):
            
            # Find any objects that overlap with the current pixel
            objects_in_pixel = []
            for obj in find_objects(input_grid):
                if (obj["center"][0] == i and obj["center"][1] == j):
                    objects_in_pixel.append(obj)
                    
            # Update the position of overlapping objects
            for obj in objects_in_pixel:
                if obj["count"] > 1:
                    # Apply the translation rule
                    obj["center"] = (
                        obj["center"][0] + (output_grid[i][j] - input_grid[obj["center"][0]][obj["center"][1]])
                        % 2,
                        obj["center"][1]
                    )
                    
                elif obj["count"] == 1:
                    # Apply the reflection rule
                    obj["center"] = (
                        obj["center"][0],
                        obj["center"][1] + len(output_grid[0]) - obj["center"][1] % 2
                    )
                    
            # Set the value of the current pixel to the average of the neighboring pixels' values
            if objects_in_pixel:
                neighbors = [
                    (i - 1, j),
                    (i + 1, j),
                    (i, j - 1),
                    (i, j + 1)
                ]
                avg_value = sum(
                    [input_grid[x][y] for x, y in neighbors]
                    / max(1, len(neighbors))
                )
                output_grid[i][j] = avg_value
    
    return output_grid

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(transform(input_grid, output_grid))  # Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

In this implementation, we define two functions: `find_objects` and `transform`. The `find_objects` function iterates through each pixel in the input grid and checks if it belongs to an existing object or creates a new object. It stores the information about objects in a dictionary where keys are tuples representing the center of the object and values are dictionaries containing information about the object's count and position. The `transform` function iterates through each pixel in the input grid and updates the position of overlapping objects using the translation and reflection rules. Finally, it sets the value of the current pixel to the average of the neighboring pixels' values.
