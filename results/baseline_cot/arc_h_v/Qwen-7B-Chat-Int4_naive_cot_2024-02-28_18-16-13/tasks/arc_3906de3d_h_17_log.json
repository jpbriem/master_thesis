            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern that connects the pixels and groups them together into objects. We will look at each pair of images and analyze the differences between them to identify the pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nIn Example 1, the input grid has 5 rows and 5 columns. The output grid also has 5 rows and 5 columns but with some differences. In the first row, there are two objects - a blue square and a yellow triangle. In the second row, there is only a blue square. In the third row, there is only a yellow triangle. In the fourth row, there is no object present. And finally, in the fifth row, there is again only a blue square. \n\nFrom this example, we can see that the pattern involves the presence and absence of objects in specific positions. The order of the objects may change, but their position relative to each other remains constant.\n\nExample 2:\nIn Example 2, the input grid has 6 rows and 8 columns. The output grid also has 6 rows and 8 columns but with some differences. In the first row, there are four objects - a green circle, a red rectangle, a blue diamond, and an orange pentagon. In the second row, there are three objects - a green circle, a red rectangle, and a blue diamond. In the third row, there are two objects - a green circle and a red rectangle. In the fourth row, there is only a green circle. And finally, in the fifth row, there is again only a green circle. \n\nFrom this example, we can see that the pattern involves the presence and absence of objects in specific positions, but also their relative sizes and orientations. The order of the objects may change, and their size and orientation may vary.\n\nOverall Pattern:\nBased on these examples, we can say that the overall pattern involves the presence and absence of objects in specific positions, with the order of the objects, their size, orientation, and color changing over time. \n\nInstructions:\nTo transform the input grid into the output grid, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the objects in the input grid using the provided guidelines.\n  2. Determine the new position and size of each object in the output grid.\n  3. Create the output grid with the new positions and sizes of the objects.\n\nTest Case Input:\nHere is the test case input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n\nTest Case Output:\nHere is the expected output:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[7, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```"
