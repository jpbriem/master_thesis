prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 5], [6, 8, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [6, 8, 0, 9, 5], [6, 8, 0, 9, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 6]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [1, 8, 2, 6]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7]]



Test case:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [7, 0, 3, 5], [7, 2, 0, 5]]

Sample Outputs:
The provided examples demonstrate three different types of pattern transformations:

  * Example 1 involves a translation and scaling operation, where the entire grid is shifted and scaled horizontally by 6 units and vertically by 5 units. In this case, the new output grid has no change in terms of pattern compared to the original input grid.
  * Example 2 involves a rotation operation around the center point (at coordinate (0, 0)) by 90 degrees clockwise. As a result, the grid is flipped horizontally and vertically. The new output grid shows two objects, each consisting of four connected pixels. The objects' positions and sizes remain unchanged after the transformation.
  * Example 3 involves an erosion operation, where small white pixels are removed from the corners of the input grid. This results in a smaller grid that contains fewer objects than the original input grid. The new output grid consists of six objects, arranged in a line from left to right. The objects' positions and sizes remain unchanged after the transformation.

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern observed in these examples is that each input grid is transformed into a corresponding output grid through a combination of translation, rotation, scaling, erosion, and other operations. These operations may involve changing the position, size, shape, or color of individual objects within the grid, or altering the larger patterns present in the grid.

Instructions:
To transform the given input grid into its corresponding output grid, follow these steps:

  1. Translate the grid horizontally and vertically by the specified amounts using the `numpy.translate()` function.
  2. Scale the grid horizontally and vertically by the specified factors using the `numpy.resize()` function.
  3. Rotate the grid around the center point using the `numpy.rotate()` function.
  4. Remove any small white pixels from the corners of the grid using the `numpy.delete()` function.
  5. Arrange the remaining objects in the grid according to their colors and positions using appropriate mathematical operations.

Note that these steps are just suggestions and may need to be modified depending on the specific requirements of the problem. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the final output grid is still consistent with the underlying pattern transformations described above.
