prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that each input corresponds to an image where each pixel value represents a specific color. Our goal is to transform these images so that they match the output described in the problem statement.
We can see that there are several examples provided, and each example has a different transformation pattern. Let's look at each example separately:

  * Example 1: This example shows a square grid with four identical objects arranged in a line. We can transform this example by simply moving each object one position to the right, effectively creating a new object in its place. The output will be the same grid but with two objects arranged in a line instead of one.
  * Example 2: In this example, the grid consists of a square and a circle. We can transform this example by rotating the square clockwise by 90 degrees and then translating it up by 1 unit. The output will be a square rotated 90 degrees and translated up by 1 unit.
  * Example 3: In this example, the grid consists of a rectangle and a triangle. We can transform this example by reflecting the rectangle horizontally and vertically, and then translating it up by 1 unit. The output will be a rectangle reflected both horizontally and vertically and translated up by 1 unit.

Based on these examples, we can conclude that the overall pattern is about transforming objects within the grid using various geometric operations such as translation, rotation, reflection, and mirroring. These transformations can be applied individually to each object or combined to create more complex patterns.
Now let's move on to the instructions section:

Instructions:
1. Start by understanding the input grid and identifying the objects within it.
2. Determine the desired transformation pattern based on the examples provided.
3. Apply the appropriate geometric operation(s) to each object to achieve the desired outcome.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have achieved the desired output.

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern for solving this problem is to apply geometric operations to objects within a grid to achieve the desired output. The specific operations used will depend on the desired outcome and the properties of the input grid and objects.
In summary, to solve this problem, you need to understand the input grid and identify the objects within it. Based on the examples provided, determine the desired transformation pattern and apply the appropriate geometric operations to achieve the desired outcome. Repeat these steps until you have achieved the desired output.
