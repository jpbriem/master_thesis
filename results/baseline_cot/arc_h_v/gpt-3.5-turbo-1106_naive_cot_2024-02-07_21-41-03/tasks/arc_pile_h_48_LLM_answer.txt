You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 1, 1], [9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 1, 1, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 3], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[3, 3, 3, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]]

Sample Outputs:
{
  "example_1_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "The input pixels with the color 3 and 4 are shifted to the right, and the zeros are shifted to the left in the output grid.",
    "object_changes": "The size of the object with color 3 decreases as some of its pixels are shifted to the right. The object with color 4 is also affected similarly."
  },
  "example_2_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "The input pixels with the color 1, 4, and 2 are shifted to the left, and the zeros are shifted to the right in the output grid.",
    "object_changes": "The size of the object with color 1 decreases as some of its pixels are shifted to the left. The object with color 4 is also affected similarly."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "In each example, the non-zero pixels are shifted either to the left or right, while the zeros are shifted in the opposite direction. The size of the objects with non-zero colors may change due to the shifting.",
  "instructions": "For each input grid, shift the non-zero pixels to the left and the zeros to the right. Update the object information accordingly if the shifting affects the size or position of the objects.",
  "test_case_input_copy": [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 8]],
  "test_case_grid_view": "In the test input grid, there are several objects of different colors, with some zeros scattered throughout the grid.",
  "test_case_object_view": "The test input contains objects with colors 7, 9, 1, 5, and 8, each with a specific size and position.",
  "test_case_transformation": "Shift the non-zero pixels to the left and the zeros to the right, updating the object information if necessary due to the shifting.",
  "test_case_output": [[7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]
