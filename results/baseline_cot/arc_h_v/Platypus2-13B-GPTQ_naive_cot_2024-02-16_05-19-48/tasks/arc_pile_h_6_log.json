            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n\n### Instruction:\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 5, 5, 0]]\noutput: [[4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]\n\n\n### Response:\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n\n{\n  \"example_1_description\": {\n    \"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, the pixels change as follows:\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe second row has been flipped.\\n\",\n    \"object_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, the objects do not change.\"\n  },\n  \"example_2_description\": {\n    \"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the second example, the pixels change as follows:\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe third column has been shifted upwards by two rows.\\n\",\n    \"object_changes\": \"Regarding the second example, the objects change as follows:\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe fourth object has changed color from 4 to 5.\",\n  },\n  \"example_3_description\": {\n    \"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the third example, the pixels change as follows:\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe second column has been shifted rightwards by three columns.\\n\",\n    \"object_changes\": \"Regarding the third example, the objects change as follows:\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe second object has changed color from 0 to 4.\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe third object has changed color from 0 to 5.\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe fourth object has changed color from 0 to 6.\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe fifth object has changed color from 0 to 7.\\n\" +\n      \"\\tThe sixth object has changed color from 0 to 9.\",\n  },\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Regarding the given examples, the input-output relationship is that each row is shifted leftwards by one column, while each column is shifted upwards by one row.\",\n  \"instructions\": \"To perform the transformation, we need to move each row leftwards by one column and each column upwards by one row.

This means that the topmost pixel in each column will become the bottom-right pixel in the next column, and so on. For example, the topmost pixel in the first column (row 0) becomes the bottom-right pixel in the second column (row 1). Similarly, the topmost pixel in the second column (row 1) becomes the bottom-right pixel in the third column (row 2), and so on. In addition, we need to update the colors of the objects accordingly. For example, the first object's color changes from 4 to 9, since it moves from the first row to the second row. Similarly, the second object's color changes from 9 to 4, since it moves from the second row to the first row. The third object's color remains unchanged, since it stays in the same row. The fourth object's color changes from 9 to 4, since it moves from the second row to the first row.
