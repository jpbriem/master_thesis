[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Example 1:

Input: [[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]]
Output: [[5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Description:
The input grid contains six objects - five squares and one rectangle. The objects are arranged in a 2x3 grid, with the top row containing two squares, the middle row containing a square and a rectangle, and the bottom row containing three squares. The output grid is obtained by applying a series of transformations to the input grid, including:

* Mirroring: The top row is mirrored horizontally to create the second row.
* Rotation: The middle row is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to create the third row.
* Scaling: The bottom row is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions to create the fourth row.
* Translation: The entire grid is translated 1 unit to the right and 1 unit down to create the final output grid.

Example 2:

Input: [[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]
Output: [[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Description:
The input grid contains six objects - five squares and one hexagon.

Output: [[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Description:
The input grid contains six objects - five squares and one octagon. The objects are arranged in a 2x3 grid, with the top row containing two squares, the middle row containing a square and an octagon, and the bottom row containing three squares. The output grid is obtained by applying a series of transformations to the input grid, including:

* Mirroring: The top row is mirrored horizontally to create the second row.
* Rotation: The middle row is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to create the third row.
* Scaling: The bottom row is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions to create the fourth row.
* Translation: The entire grid is translated 1 unit to the right and 1 unit down to create the final output grid.

Test Case:

Input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]]

Description:
The input grid contains six objects - five squares and one hexagon. The objects are arranged in a 2x3 grid, with the top row containing two squares, the middle row containing a square and a hexagon, and the bottom row containing three squares. The output grid is obtained by applying a series of transformations to the input grid, including:

* Mirroring: The top row is mirrored horizontally to create the second row.
* Rotation: The middle row is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to create the third row.
* Scaling: The bottom row is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions to create the fourth row.
* Translation: The entire grid is translated 1 unit to the right and 1 unit down to create the final output grid.

The transformations applied to the input grid result in a new arrangement of objects in the output grid, while preserving the spatial relationships between the objects.
