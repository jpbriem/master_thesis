[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 1]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 3, 0, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 1], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[3, 9, 5, 0], [3, 0, 5, 2], [3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 9, 5, 2]]

"pixel_changes": "All pixels with value 2 were replaced by value 0, except for the top-left corner where they were replaced by value 8. The bottom-right corner was changed from 0 to 8.",
"object_changes": "Object 1 has shrunk by 1 pixel in the x-direction and now touches object 2. Object 2 has moved 1 pixel to the right."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The middle row has been reversed, and the last column has been duplicated and shifted to the left.",
"object_changes": "Object 1 has been split into two objects, one with color 3 and one with color 0. Object 2 has been moved 1 pixel up and expanded 1 pixel to the left."
},
"overall_pattern": "A successful submission should demonstrate an understanding of the given input-output relationships by applying them to the test case. It should also show the ability to break down complex patterns into simpler ones and identify common sub-patterns.",
"instructions": "Step 1: Identify the basic building blocks of the pattern, such as lines, rectangles, and symmetries. Step 2: Analyze how these building blocks are combined and transformed in the given input-output pairs. Step 3: Apply the learned rules to the test case, paying attention to the subtleties of zero-indexing and wrapping around edges. Bonus points for elegance and efficiency in the solution.",

"test_case_object_view": "Object 1 is a horizontal stripe of length 3 with color 3, starting at position (1,1). Object 2 is a horizontal stripe of length 2 with color 5, starting at position (2,1). Object 3 is a vertical line of length 2 with color 9, starting at position (1,3).",
"test_case_transformation": "Apply the following operations to the test input grid: 1. Replace every pixel with value 3 with value 8. 2. Shift the second row three positions to the right. 3. Duplicate the third column and move it one position down. 4. Change the fourth row's fifth pixel from 0 to 2.",
