You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  The given input-output pairs exhibit a common pattern, suggesting a specific transformation rule. Based on this relationship, we can create an algorithm to convert a new input grid into its corresponding output grid. To better understand the problem, let's analyze the input-output pairs and their commonalities.

Firstly, we notice that each input grid has a unique shape, with some pixels having a value of 4, while others are 0. The output grids maintain the same shape but have different pixel values. This suggests that the transformation focuses on altering pixel values rather than changing the grid's overall structure.

Next, we observe that each row of the input grid contains a sequence of 0s and 4s. The transformation appears to operate on these sequences, modifying their contents and order. Additionally, there are no isolated pixels with a value of 4; all 4-valued pixels are connected to other 4-valued pixels either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This implies that the transformation may involve operations like shifting, rotation, or reflection.

Now, let's examine the differences between the three input-output pairs. In Example 1, the top-left quadrant remains unchanged, while the bottom-right quadrant is modified. Example 2 introduces a vertical shift, swapping the positions of two rows. Lastly, Example 3 combines both techniques, applying a vertical shift and altering the bottom-right quadrant.

Based on these observations, we can postulate the general transformation rule as follows:

1. Initialize an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. Apply a vertical shift to the input grid, potentially moving rows up or down.
3. Update the values in each row of the input grid by cyclically shifting the sequence of 0s and 4s. The shift amount will depend on the row index and the grid size.
4. For every non-zero element in the input grid, find its position in the grid and set the corresponding output grid cell to its original value.
5. If necessary, reflect the output grid along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) or rotate it by 180 degrees around the center, depending on the parity of the number of rows.
6. Return the resulting output grid.

To implement this algorithm, you can write a function accepting a NumPy array representing the input grid and returning the corresponding output grid. You can use NumPy's advanced indexing features, such as integer arrays for row and column indexing, to efficiently perform the operations described above.
