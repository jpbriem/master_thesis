[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

Firstly, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.
* There are objects in the grid that are defined by their color and coordinates.
* The task is to transform the input grid into an output grid using a set of rules that are based on geometric and topological concepts.
* The output grid will also have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Now, let's try to identify the underlying pattern in the input-output pairs you provided. It seems like the tasks involve performing basic geometric operations such as line connections, rectangle formation, and symmetry. Additionally, there may be some noise pixels present in the grid that need to be ignored.

Based on this information, I would suggest the following approach to solve the problem:

1. Preprocessing: Clean up the input grid by removing any noise pixels and filling in any gaps that may exist in the objects. This can be done by iterating through each pixel in the grid and applying a series of logical operations based on the surrounding pixels. For example, if a pixel has a value of 0 and its neighbors all have values greater than 0, then change its value to match the color of its neighbors.
2. Object recognition: Identify the objects in the grid by finding contiguous regions of identical color. You can use a simple algorithm like flood fill or breadth-first search to accomplish this. Once the objects are identified, extract their coordinates and sizes.
3. Application of geometric and topological rules: Apply the given rules to the recognized objects, taking into account their coordinates and sizes. For instance, if two objects are touching, combine them into a single object. If an object has a certain symmetry, replicate it accordingly.
4. Creation of the output grid: Based on the transformed objects, create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. Assign a unique color to each transformed object and place it in the corresponding position in the output grid.
5. Post-processing: Iterate through the output grid and apply any remaining rules that may affect the final result. For example, if there are any isolated pixels of a certain color, change their value to match the color of neighboring pixels.

I hope this helps you get started on solving the problem! Let me know if you have any further questions or require more guidance.
