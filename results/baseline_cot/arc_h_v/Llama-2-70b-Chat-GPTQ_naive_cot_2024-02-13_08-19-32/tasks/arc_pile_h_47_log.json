The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]]\noutput: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  {\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"The first example demonstrates a simple translation of a rectangle.

The input grid contains three objects - a horizontal red line, a vertical green line, and a yellow rectangle. The output grid features the same objects, but with altered positions and sizes. The red line has been translated upwards, the green line has been reflected around the y-axis, and the yellow rectangle has been scaled up and rotated clockwise.\",\n\"object_changes\": \"The red line's coordinates have changed from (0,1) to (1,1), while maintaining its original length. The green line's coordinates have changed from (1,0) to (1,-1), with a reflection around the y-axis. The yellow rectangle has expanded from a 2x2 square to a 3x3 square, rotating 45 degrees clockwise around its center (coordinates changing from (2,2) to (3,1)).\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Both examples demonstrate geometric transformations such as translations, reflections, and scaling. These transformations affect both individual pixels and objects as a whole. The first example focuses on a single object, while the second combines several objects with distinct transformations.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Identify the underlying pattern connecting input and output grids in each example.

The blue and red squares occupy the top row, while the yellow and green squares share the bottom row.\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"Each object has a unique color and maintains its original size throughout the transformation process.\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"Apply a combination of translations, reflections, and scaling to create the output grid. Specifically, the blue rectangle should move two positions right and one position down, the red square should reflect around the x-axis, the yellow square should expand to a 3x3 square while rotating 45 degrees clockwise, and the green square should translate two positions left and one position up.\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"[[8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\"\n}"
