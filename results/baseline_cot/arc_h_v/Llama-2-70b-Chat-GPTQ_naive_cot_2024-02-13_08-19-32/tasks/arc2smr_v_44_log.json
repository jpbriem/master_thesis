The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.\n\nFirstly, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.\n* There are objects in the grid that are defined by their color and shape.\n* Some objects may touch each other, but they don't overlap.\n* The task is to transform the input grid into an output grid using a set of rules that we need to infer.\n\nBased on the examples provided, here are some observations and deductions:\n\n* The input grid has a size of 6x6, while the output grid has a size of 7x7.\n* In the output grid, there are two additional rows and columns compared to the input grid.\n* The objects in the input grid are transformed into larger objects in the output grid, with the same shape and color.\n* The objects are moved or rotated in the output grid, possibly due to symmetry or mirroring.\n* The output grid contains more objects than the input grid, with new objects appearing in the added rows and columns.\n\nNow, let's try to formalize the rules for transforming the input grid into the output grid. Here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input grid and determine their properties, such as color, shape, and size.\n2. Apply transformations to the objects, such as rotation, mirroring, or scaling, potentially based on symmetries or patterns in the grid.\n3. Move the objects to new positions in the output grid, taking into account the additional rows and columns.\n4. Ensure that the objects in the output grid do not overlap and maintain the same color and shape as in the input grid.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all objects in the input grid until the output grid is complete.\n\nOf course, this is just one possible approach, and there may be variations or additional rules depending on the specific instances. But hopefully, this gives us a good starting point for solving the problem!"
