[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 6, 3, 0, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 0, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6, 9, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first example has a horizontal line of three pixels (3, 0, 0) that is shifted two positions to the right, resulting in a new row of three pixels (0, 0, 3). Additionally, there is a single pixel (1) that moves diagonally from the top left to bottom right, changing color from white to black.",
"object_changes": "There are two objects in the input grid: a horizontal line of three pixels (3, 0, 0) and a single pixel (1). In the output grid, these objects have changed as follows: the horizontal line has moved two positions to the right and become a row of three pixels (0, 0, 3), while the single pixel (1) has moved diagonally from the top left to bottom right and changed color from white to black."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The second example has a single pixel (2) that is duplicated three times horizontally, resulting in four identical pixels (2, 2, 2, 2).",
"object_changes": "There is only one object in the input grid - a single pixel (2). In the output grid, this object has been duplicated three times horizontally, resulting in four identical pixels (2, 2, 2, 2)."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs is that objects in the input grid are transformed into new objects in the output grid through a combination of shifting, scaling, and color changes. Pixels that are not part of any object remain unchanged.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, you must identify the specific transformation pattern applied to each input-output pair and apply it to the test case input grid. Pay attention to the changes in pixel values, object sizes, coordinates, shapes, and colors between the input and output grids. Use these clues to determine the required transformation actions and apply them step by step to obtain the test case output grid.",
"test_case_input_copy": "Copy the test case input grid from the task: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "Describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns: The grid consists of five rows and five columns. There are nine pixels with values ranging from 0 to 9, with most pixels having the value 0. There are four objects in the grid - three horizontal lines of three pixels each (8, 0, 0; 0, 2, 7; 8, 0, 7) and a single pixel (1) located in the center of the grid. The objects are arranged in a diagonal pattern, with the top left corner of the grid containing the highest concentration of non-zero pixels.",
"test_case_object_view": "Describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number: There are four objects in the grid - three horizontal lines of three pixels each (8, 0, 0; 0, 2, 7; 8, 0, 7) and a single pixel (1) located in the center of the grid. Each object has a unique color - three objects have the color 8, one object has the color 2, and one object has the color 1. The three horizontal lines have a length of three pixels each, while the single pixel has a size of one pixel. The coordinates of the objects range from (0, 0) to (2, 7) and (8, 9). The shape of the objects is either a horizontal line or a single pixel. There are four objects in total.",
"test_case_transformation": "Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed: To transform the test case input grid, apply the following steps: 1. Shift the grid diagonally by two positions to the right and upward. 2. Scale the grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. 3. Change the color of every other pixel (starting from the top left) to the next color in the cycle (8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 1 -> 8). 4. Add a new object consisting of a single pixel (9) located at the center of the grid. 5. Remove the top left corner pixel (8) and replace it with a copy of the pixel to its right (0).",
"test_case_output": "Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
