[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.
* There are objects in the grid that are defined by their color and coordinates.
* The task is to transform the input grid into an output grid using a specific set of rules.
* The output grid will also have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Now, let's talk about the rules for transforming the grid. From what I understand, we need to apply a series of operations to the grid, such as:

* Mirroring: Reflecting the grid vertically or horizontally around a certain axis.
* Rotating: Turning the grid by a certain angle clockwise or counterclockwise.
* Scaling: Increasing or decreasing the size of the grid by a certain factor.
* Translating: Moving the grid by a certain amount in the x or y direction.
* Elastic deformation: Stretching or shrinking parts of the grid in a non-uniform way.
* Copying and pasting: Duplicating part of the grid and placing it elsewhere.

These operations can be combined in various ways to create complex transformations. For example, we could reflect the grid vertically, then rotate it by 90 degrees, and finally scale it up by a factor of 2.

To apply these operations to the grid, we'll need to use some mathematical formulas. For instance, if we want to reflect the grid vertically, we can simply flip the values of every other row. If we want to rotate the grid by 90 degrees, we can use trigonometric functions like sin() and cos() to calculate the new values of each pixel.

Once we have applied all the necessary operations, we'll have our output grid! But before that, there's one more thing we need to take care of...

Ah, yes! The test cases! We need to make sure that our algorithm works correctly for all possible input grids. That means we'll have to run it through a bunch of test cases to ensure that it produces the correct output for each one.

Let's start with the first test case. We have an input grid with a few objects in it, and we need to apply the appropriate transformations to get the output grid. Based on the given description, it seems like we need to mirror the grid vertically, rotate it by 90 degrees, and then scale it up by a factor of 2.

Here's what the input grid looks like:
