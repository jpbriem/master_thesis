[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[6, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

"pixel_changes": "The second example has several lines of pixels with various values that are modified in the output. Specifically, there are four rows with values 5, 7, 4, and 9, respectively, which are changed to four rows with values 5, 7, 4, and 8, respectively, in the output.",
"object_changes": "There are six objects in the input grid, colored 5, 7, 4, 9, 0, and 2, respectively. In the output, these objects are modified such that the objects colored 5, 7, 4, and 9 remain unchanged, while the object colored 0 is removed, and the object colored 2 is transformed into an object with color 8."

"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve modifying certain lines or blocks of pixels while maintaining the overall structure of the grid. This includes changing some pixels' values while leaving others intact, as well as altering the color of specific objects while keeping their size and position relatively consistent.",

"instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps:

1. Identify lines or blocks of pixels with the same value in the input grid.
2. Modify the values of these lines or blocks according to the given pattern, while leaving the remaining pixels unchanged.
3. Update the colors of certain objects while preserving their size and position.
