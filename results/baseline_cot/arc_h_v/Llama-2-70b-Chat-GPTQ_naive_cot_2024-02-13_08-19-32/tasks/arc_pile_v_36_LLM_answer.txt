[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 6, 3, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 8, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0], [7, 5, 8, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first row has been inverted, with the first three pixels set to 0 and the last two pixels set to 6 and 3, respectively. The second row remains unchanged. The third row has been shifted one pixel to the right, with the first three pixels set to 0, the fourth pixel set to 3, and the fifth pixel set to 9. The fourth row has been inverted, with the first three pixels set to 0 and the last two pixels set to 3 and 9, respectively. The fifth row remains unchanged.",
"object_changes": "There are three objects in the input grid: a vertical line of length 3 in the first row, a horizontal line of length 3 in the second row, and a rectangle of size 2x2 in the third row. In the output grid, these objects have been transformed into a single object - a rectangle of size 2x3 in the third row."

"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first column has been inverted, with the first three pixels set to 0 and the last two pixels set to 7 and 5, respectively. The second column remains unchanged. The third column has been shifted one pixel to the left, with the first three pixels set to 0, the fourth pixel set to 5, and the fifth pixel set to 8. The fourth column has been inverted, with the first three pixels set to 0 and the last two pixels set to 5 and 8, respectively. The fifth column remains unchanged.",
"object_changes": "There are four objects in the input grid: a horizontal line of length 3 in the first column, a vertical line of length 3 in the second column, a rectangle of size 2x2 in the third column, and a rectangle of size 2x2 in the fourth column. In the output grid, these objects have been transformed into a single object - a rectangle of size 2x4 in the third column."
},
"overall_pattern": "Both examples follow a similar pattern of inverting rows and columns, shifting objects, and combining them into a single object. It appears that the goal is to create a single object from multiple smaller objects, while also changing the layout of the grid.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, you must identify the rules governing the transformation of the input grid into the output grid. These rules may involve inverting rows and columns, shifting objects, and combining them into a single object. You must then apply these rules to the test input grid to produce the test output grid.",
