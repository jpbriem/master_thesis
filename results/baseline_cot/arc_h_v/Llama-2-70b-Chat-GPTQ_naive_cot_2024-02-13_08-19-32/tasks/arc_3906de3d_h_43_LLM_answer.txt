You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.
* There are objects in the grid that are defined by their color and shape.
* Some objects may touch each other, but they don't overlap.
* The task is to transform the input grid into an output grid using a set of rules that we need to figure out.

Based on the examples provided, here are some observations and hypotheses:

* The input grid has a size of 3x5, while the output grid has a size of 4x4.
* Each row of the input grid is transformed into a row of the output grid, with some pixels possibly changing color or moving position.
* The objects in the input grid seem to be preserved in the output grid, but their positions and sizes may change.
* There are some empty spaces in the output grid that were not present in the input grid.
* The color 9 appears to play a special role in the transformation, as it is often found in the output grid even though it is not present in the input grid.

Now, let's try to formalize the rules for the transformation. Here's a possible approach:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary called `transform` that will map each pixel in the input grid to its corresponding pixel in the output grid.
2. For each row of the input grid, apply the following operations:
a. If the current row contains only zeros, leave the corresponding row in the output grid unchanged.
b. Otherwise, find the leftmost non-zero pixel in the current row and move it to the rightmost position in the corresponding row of the output grid.
c. If there are multiple non-zero pixels in the current row, separate them by a distance of at least two pixels in the output grid.
d. Fill any remaining empty spaces in the output grid with the color 9.
3. After applying steps 2a-d to all rows of the input grid, fill any remaining empty spaces in the output grid with the color 4.
4. Return the completed output grid.

Here's an example of how this algorithm would work for the first input grid:

Input Grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

Output Grid:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 9]

As you can see, the algorithm starts by filling the first row of the output grid with the values from the first row of the input grid, since all pixels in the first row are zero. In the second row, the algorithm moves the leftmost non-zero pixel (which is the only non-zero pixel in the row) to the rightmost position in the corresponding row of the output grid. This creates a gap of two pixels between the moved pixel and the next non-zero pixel, which is filled with the color 9. The algorithm repeats this process for the remaining rows of the input grid, always leaving a gap of at least two pixels between non-zero pixels in the output grid. Finally, the algorithm fills any remaining empty spaces in the output grid with the color 4.

I hope this helps you get started on solving the problem! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
