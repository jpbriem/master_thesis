The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

I'll do my best to help you solve it.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.\n* There are also pixels with a value of 0, which represent the background color.\n* The task is to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid, based on a set of rules that we need to infer.\n* The input and output grids have the same size, and the transformation should be done in a way that preserves the overall pattern of the grid.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at the input grid:\n\n* The first row consists entirely of 8s, except for a single 0 in the last column.\n* The second row has a similar pattern, with 8s in every position except for two 0s in the last two columns.\n* The third row has a similar pattern again, with 8s in every position except for three 0s in the last three columns.\n* The fourth row is similar to the first row, with 8s in every position except for a single 0 in the last column.\n* The fifth row is similar to the second row, with 8s in every position except for two 0s in the last two columns.\n* The sixth row is similar to the third row, with 8s in every position except for three 0s in the last three columns.\n* The seventh row is similar to the first row, with 8s in every position except for a single 0 in the last column.\n* The eighth row is similar to the second row, with 8s in every position except for two 0s in the last two columns.\n* The ninth row is similar to the third row, with 8s in every position except for three 0s in the last three columns.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems like the pattern in the input grid is created by alternating between rows of 8s and rows of 0s, with a single 0 or groups of 0s appearing in specific positions in each row.\n\nNow, let's look at the output grid:\n\n* The first row consists entirely of 8s, except for a single 0 in the last column.\n* The second row has a similar pattern, with 8s in every position except for two 0s in the last two columns.\n* The third row has a similar pattern again, with 8s in every position except for three 0s in the last three columns.\n* The fourth row is similar to the first row, with 8s in every position except for a single 0 in the last column.\n* The fifth row is similar to the second row, with 8s in every position except for two 0s in the last two columns.\n* The sixth row is similar to the third row, with 8s in every position except for three 0s in the last three columns.\n* The seventh row is similar to the first row, with 8s in every position except for a single 0 in the last column.\n* The eighth row is similar to the second row, with 8s in every position except for two 0s in the last two columns.\n* The ninth row is similar to the third row, with 8s in every position except for three 0s in the last three columns.\n\nIt appears that the output grid is simply a rotation of the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise. In other words, each row of the input grid becomes a column of the output grid, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the transformation rule can be described as follows:\n\n* For each row of the input grid, rotate the elements 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the corresponding row of the output grid.\n* For each column of the input grid, rotate the elements 90 degrees counterclockwise to obtain the corresponding column of the output grid.\n\nHere's an example of how this transformation would work for the first few rows of the input grid:\n\nInput Grid:\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0]\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0]\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0]\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n\nOutput Grid:\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0]\n[8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0]\n[8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n[8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional clarification."
