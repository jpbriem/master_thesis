The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

I'll do my best to help you solve it.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.\n* There are also pixels with a value of 0, which represent the background color.\n* The task is to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid, based on a set of rules that we need to infer.\n* The input and output grids have the same size, and the transformation should be done in a way that preserves the overall pattern of the grid.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at the input grid:\n\n* The first row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by four pixels with a value of 0.\n* The second row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by three pixels with a value of 0.\n* The third row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by two pixels with a value of 0.\n* The fourth row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The fifth row has four pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The sixth row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The seventh row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The eighth row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The ninth row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n\nBased on this observation, it seems like the pattern in the input grid is a repeated sequence of five pixels with a value of 5, followed by a varying number of pixels with a value of 0.\n\nNow, let's look at the output grid:\n\n* The first row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by four pixels with a value of 0.\n* The second row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by three pixels with a value of 0.\n* The third row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by two pixels with a value of 0.\n* The fourth row has five pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The fifth row has four pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The sixth row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The seventh row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The eighth row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n* The ninth row has three pixels with a value of 5, followed by one pixel with a value of 0.\n\nIt looks like the output grid is simply a shifted version of the input grid, with the same pattern repeated nine times.\n\nSo, the rule for transforming the input grid into the output grid seems to be:\n\n* For each row, repeat the pattern of five pixels with a value of 5, followed by a varying number of pixels with a value of 0, until the end of the row is reached.\n\nHere's a summary of the steps to apply this rule:\n\n1. Initialize an empty output grid with the same size as the input grid.\n2. Set the first five pixels in the first row of the output grid to 5.\n3. Set the next pixel in the first row of the output grid to 0.\n4. For each subsequent row in the input grid, repeat steps 2-3 until the end of the row is reached.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the output grid is reached.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."
