You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  The given input-output pairs represent a pattern recognition problem. The task is to identify the underlying transformation that maps the input grid to the corresponding output grid. The transformation appears to be a combination of geometric and topological operations, such as line connections, rectangle formation, symmetry, and scaling.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the input-output pairs and identify the common features and patterns shared by each pair. We can then use these features to infer the transformation rules and create a general solution that can be applied to any input grid.

Here's a possible approach to solving this problem:

1. Analyze the input-output pairs:
* Example 1:
	+ Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
	+ Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
* Example 2:
	+ Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
	+ Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
* Example 3:
	+ Input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
	+ Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
2. Identify common features and patterns:
* All inputs have a rectangular shape with a height of 5 rows and a width of 5 columns.
* Each row and column has a repeating pattern of 0s and 1s.
* There are no duplicate pixels with the same color in the input grid.
* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
* Each output pixel has a unique color, either 0, 5, or 7.
* Adjacent pixels in the output grid have the same color.
* There are no isolated pixels in the output grid.
3. Infer transformation rules:
* Rule 1: If a pixel in the input grid has a color of 0, it becomes a pixel with color 5 in the output grid.
* Rule 2: If a pixel in the input grid has a color of 1, it remains unchanged in the output grid.
* Rule 3: If a pixel in the input grid has a color of 5, it becomes a pixel with color 7 in the output grid.
4. Apply transformation rules to create the output grid:
* Starting from the top-left corner, iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
* For each pixel, apply the corresponding transformation rule to update the output grid.
5. Return the output grid.

Note: This is a simplified explanation of the transformation rules. The actual rules may be more complex, considering factors like symmetry, rotation, and combinations of colors.
