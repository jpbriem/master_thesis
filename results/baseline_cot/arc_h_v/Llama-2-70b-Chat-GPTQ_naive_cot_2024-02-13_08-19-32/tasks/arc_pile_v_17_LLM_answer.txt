[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 5, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 0], [0, 8, 0, 5, 9, 0], [6, 8, 2, 5, 9, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 6, 2, 0, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 8, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 2, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 2, 8, 9, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[7, 1, 5, 2], [0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {

"pixel_changes": "The first example has a horizontal line of pixels with values 0, 8, and 9, which remains unchanged in the output. There are two objects in the input - a rectangle with color 8 and a small square with color 9. The rectangle expands horizontally, absorbing the small square, and its color changes to match the surrounding pixels. The output has a single object - a large rectangle with color 8.",

"pixel_changes": "The second example has a vertical line of pixels with values 0, 6, and 9, which remains unchanged in the output. There are three objects in the input - two rectangles with colors 6 and 9, and a small square with color 1. The rectangles move upwards, and their colors change to match the surrounding pixels. The small square moves downwards and changes color to match the surrounding pixels.",
"object_changes": "There are three objects in the input - two rectangles with colors 6 and 9, and a small square with color 1. The rectangles move upwards, and their colors change to match the surrounding pixels. The small square moves downwards and changes color to match the surrounding pixels."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship is based on geometric transformations such as expansion, contraction, rotation, translation, and reflection. The objects in the input grid are modified by these transformations while maintaining their original shape and color. The output grid reflects the transformed objects, preserving the spatial relationships between them.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, follow these steps:

1. Identify the type of transformation in each example, such as expansion, contraction, rotation, translation, or reflection.
2. Analyze the affected areas of the grid due to the transformation.
3. Update the pixel values accordingly, considering the new positions and colors of the objects.
4. Repeat the process for all input-output pairs, ensuring consistent application of the transformation rules.",
