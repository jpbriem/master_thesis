You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1], [5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 7, 0, 1], [5, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 4, 1], [5, 9, 0, 7, 4, 1], [5, 9, 0, 7, 4, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 8, 0, 0, 1, 7]]



Test case:
input: [[6, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0], [0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! After analyzing the input-output pairs, I have identified the following pattern:

* The transformation applies to the entire grid, not just individual objects.
* The grid is stretched or compressed in the x-axis and y-axis directions, possibly with different scaling factors for each axis.
* Pixels with value 0 remain unchanged, while pixels with value 1 change to 0 and vice versa.
* Pixels with value 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 change to a specific target value based on their original value. It seems that these values are shifted by some amount, possibly wrapping around the range (e.g., 2 becomes 6, 3 becomes 7, etc.).
* There may be additional rules for handling objects that touch the boundary of the grid.

Based on this analysis, here's my attempt at describing the relation between the input and output grids:

Let G be the input grid, and H be the output grid. Let N be the number of rows in G, and M be the number of columns in G.

1. First, apply a scaling factor to G to make it larger or smaller. Specifically, double the dimensions of G in both the x and y directions, so that each pixel (i, j) in G becomes four pixels (2i, 2j, 2i+1, 2j+1) in H.
2. Next, iterate through each pixel (i, j) in H, applying the following transformations:
* If H(i, j) = 0, leave it unchanged.
* If H(i, j) = 1, set H(i, j) = 0.
* Otherwise, if H(i, j) belongs to the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, map it to a new value based on the following table:
{
2 -> 6,
3 -> 7,
4 -> 8,
5 -> 9,
6 -> 2,
7 -> 3,
8 -> 4,
9 -> 5
}.
Wrap around the range, so that if the mapped value would exceed 9, subtract 9 from it instead.
* If H(i, j) = 0, and there exists a pixel k in G such that k!= 0 and k == H(i-1, j-1) or k == H(i-1, j) or k == H(i-1, j+1) or k == H(i, j-1) or k == H(i, j+1) or k == H(i+1, j-1) or k == H(i+1, j) or k == H(i+1, j+1), then set H(i, j) = 1.
3. Finally, compress the dimensions of H back down to the original size of G, so that each 2x2 block of pixels in H becomes a single pixel in the output grid.

I hope this description helps you understand the pattern and create the desired output grid!
