[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 5], [4, 0, 6, 1, 5], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 2, 6, 1, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0, 7], [0, 0, 6, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 7], [2, 1, 6, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 6], [2, 9, 0, 4, 6], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 6], [2, 9, 1, 4, 6]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 4], [8, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first row has been duplicated, and the last column has been copied three times. There is a new object of color 5 in the third row, fifth column. The second object has moved to the right and down.",
"object_changes": "Object 1 has changed color from 2 to 0 and has been resized from 3x3 to 4x4. Object 2 has moved from (0,1) to (1,2) and has changed color from 2 to 5."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first two rows have been swapped. The third row has been shifted two positions to the left. The fourth row has been duplicated.",
"object_changes": "Object 1 has moved from (0,0) to (1,1) and has changed color from 2 to 0. Object 2 has moved from (2,1) to (1,1) and has changed color from 1 to 7. Object 3 has moved from (2,0) to (1,7) and has changed color from 6 to 7."
},
"overall_pattern": "It appears that the input grid is being modified by a series of row and column operations, including duplication, shifting, and swapping. Additionally, objects are being transformed by changing their color, size, and position.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, you must identify the specific operations being applied to the input grid and replicate them to create the output grid. Pay close attention to the changes made to both pixels and objects between each input-output pair, and note any patterns or relationships that emerge.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[8, 0, 0, 1, 4], [8, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The input grid consists of five rows and five columns, with values ranging from 0 to 9. There are four objects in the grid - two yellow objects (color 8) and two red objects (color 2). One yellow object is located in the top-left corner, while the other is situated in the middle row. The red objects are placed in the bottom-right corner and in the middle column.",
"test_case_object_view": "The objects in the grid have various sizes, coordinates, and movements. Yellow objects have a size of 2x2, while red objects have a size of 1x1. One yellow object has moved down and right, while the other remains stationary. Both red objects have moved up and left.",
"test_case_transformation": "To transform the input grid into the output grid, apply the following steps:

1. Duplicate the first row twice.
2. Swap the second and third rows.
3. Shift the fourth row two positions to the left.
4. Copy the last column three times.
5. Modify the color, size, and position of objects according to the given descriptions.",
