[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 5]]
output: [[3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has six rows and five columns. The top row and leftmost column are entirely zeroes except for a lone 5 in the second position of the second row. The rest of the grid consists of a 2x2 block of twos surrounded by zeros, with a single three in the bottom-left corner. The output grid maintains the same structure but with all pixels set to their respective objects' representative colors.",
"object_changes": "There are two objects in the input grid - a 2x2 block of color 2 (represented by white) surrounded by color 0 (represented by black) and a single color 3 (represented by green) in the bottom-left corner. In the output grid, these objects remain unchanged."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has four rows and four columns. All pixels are either zero or one, with the exception of a 2x2 block of twos in the top-right quadrant. The output grid maintains the same structure but with all pixels set to their respective objects' representative colors.",
"object_changes": "There are four objects in the input grid - three 1x1 blocks of color 1 (represented by red) and a 2x2 block of color 2 (represented by blue). In the output grid, these objects remain unchanged."
},
"overall_pattern": "Both input-output pairs exhibit a similarity in structure, suggesting that the transformation applies to the entire grid rather than individual objects. It appears that pixels are replaced by their respective object's representative color, indicating an arithmetical operation based on objects.",
"instructions": "To perform the transformation, follow these steps:
1. Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
3. If the current pixel belongs to an object (i.e., it is not zero), replace it with the representative color of that object in the output grid.
4. Repeat step 3 for every pixel in the input grid.
5. Return the resulting output grid.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[9, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid has five rows and five columns. The top row and leftmost column are entirely zeroes except for a lone 5 in the second position of the second row. The rest of the grid consists of a 2x2 block of twos surrounded by zeros, with a single three in the bottom-left corner. There are five objects in the grid - four 1x1 blocks of color 1 (represented by red) and a 2x2 block of color 2 (represented by blue).",

2. A 1x1 block of color 1 located at (1,0).
3. A 1x1 block of color 1 located at (1,1).
