prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]]
output: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [9, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 9, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]
output: [[9, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 9, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "All pixels remain unchanged except for the top-left corner which changes from 0 to 8.",
"object_changes": "There is one new object created in the top-left corner with color 8 and size 1x1."
},

"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The middle row switches from 0 to 1, while the bottom row switches from 0 to 9.",
"object_changes": "Two new objects are created - one with color 1 and size 1x3 in the middle row, and another with color 9 and size 1x3 in the bottom row."
},

"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship is that each row is transformed independently, either by changing all pixels to a single value (as in Example 1) or by creating/modifying objects (as in Examples 2 and 3).",

"instructions": "For each row, identify the number of pixels that need to change and their corresponding output values. Create/modify objects accordingly. The transformation applies to the entire grid, without affecting the background color (value 0).",

"test_case_input_copy": "[[0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 9, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]",

"test_case_grid_view": "The input grid has five rows and six columns, with values ranging from 0 to 9. There are four objects - two horizontal stripes of color 6 and 8, and two vertical lines of color 1 and 2.",

"test_case_object_view": "Each object has a unique color and size. The top-left object is 1x1 with color 8, the middle object is 3x1 with color 6, the bottom-left object is 1x3 with color 1, and the rightmost object is 1x3 with color 2.",

"test_case_transformation": "Apply the following operations to each row:

* Row 1: Replace all pixels with 8.
* Row 2: Replace all pixels with 0.
* Row 3: Split the row into two parts - the left three pixels remain unchanged (color 9), and the right two pixels change to 1.
* Row 4: Replace all pixels with 2.
* Row 5: Replace all pixels with 0.",

"test_case_output": "[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 1, 1, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
