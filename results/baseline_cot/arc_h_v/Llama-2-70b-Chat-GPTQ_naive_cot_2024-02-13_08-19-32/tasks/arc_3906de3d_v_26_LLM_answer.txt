[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color.
* There are objects in the grid that are defined by connected pixels of the same color.
* The task is to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid using a specific transformation pattern.
* The transformation pattern involves changing the color of certain pixels, moving some pixels around, and possibly creating new objects or merging existing ones.
* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

Now, let's analyze the input-output pairs you provided:

1. Example 1:
Input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]

From this example, we can observe the following patterns:

* The objects in the grid are rectangles with a height of 3 pixels.
* The objects are arranged horizontally, with a gap of 1 pixel between them.
* The color of the objects alternates between 8 and 0.
* The top-left corner of each object is always colored 8.
* The bottom-right corner of each object is always colored 0.
* There are no objects that touch each other vertically.
* There are no objects that touch each other horizontally.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rules for the transformation pattern:

1. The transformation pattern involves flipping the colors of the pixels in each object.
2. The top-left corner of each object remains unchanged.
3. The bottom-right corner of each object becomes the opposite color.
4. The remaining pixels in each object alternate their colors.
5. No two objects can touch each other either horizontally or vertically.
6. The objects maintain their original shape and size.
7. The background color remains unchanged.

Now, let's apply these rules to the test input grid you provided:

Input: [[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]]

Using the rules we deduced earlier, we can apply the transformation pattern to the test input grid:

1. Flip the colors of the pixels in each object.
2. Keep the top-left corner of each object unchanged.
3. Change the bottom-right corner of each object to the opposite color.
4. Alternate the colors of the remaining pixels in each object.
5. Ensure that no two objects touch each other either horizontally or vertically.
6. Maintain the original shape and size of each object.
7. Leave the background color unchanged.

After applying the transformation pattern, the output grid would look like this:

Output: [[0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

I hope this helps you get started with solving the problem! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
