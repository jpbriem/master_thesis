[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0]]
output: [[7, 7, 7, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]]

  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "All pixels remain unchanged except for the top-left corner which is modified from 0 to 9, and the bottom-right corner which is modified from 0 to 6.",
"object_changes": "There is one new object created in the top-left corner with color 9, size 3, and coordinates (0,1) and (0,2). The original object in the bottom-right corner with color 6 has been resized to twice its original size."
},

"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The top row remains unchanged while the second row is modified with a new object of color 3 and size 3, starting from the third pixel. The fourth row remains unchanged, while the bottom row is modified with a new object of color 4 and size 2, starting from the fifth pixel.",
"object_changes": "Two new objects are created - one in the second row with color 3, size 3, and coordinates (1,1) and (1,2), and another in the bottom row with color 4, size 2, and coordinates (4,1) and (5,1)."
},

"overall_pattern": "A consistent modification is applied to every nth pixel (where n is an integer greater than 1) in the grid, where each modified pixel takes on the value of the nearest object's color that lies within a certain distance (e.g., 1 pixel away). If there are no objects within the specified distance, then the pixel remains unchanged.",

"instructions": "For each input grid, find the nearest object(s) to each pixel, and assign the color of the closest object(s) to that pixel if it falls within a specified distance. If multiple objects are found within the distance, choose the object with the highest priority (based on size, coordinate, or other criteria).",

"test_case_input_copy": "[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]]"
"test_case_grid_view": "The input grid consists of six rows and five columns. The top-left corner contains the value 8, while the bottom-right corner contains the value 4. There are three objects present in the grid - two objects with values 7 and 3 in the second and fourth rows, respectively, and one object with value 5 in the fifth column.",

"test_case_object_view": "The three objects in the grid are - an object with color 7, size 2, and coordinates (0,1) and (0,2); an object with color 3, size 1, and coordinates (2,2); and an object with color 5, size 1, and coordinates (4,4).",

"test_case_transformation": "Apply the rule of modifying every nth pixel (where n > 1) based on the nearest object's color within a certain distance. For this specific input, consider objects within a 1-pixel distance. Modify the pixels in the grid such that each pixel takes on the value of the nearest object's color that lies within the specified distance. If there are no objects within the distance, leave the pixel unchanged.",

"test_case_output": "[[0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]"
