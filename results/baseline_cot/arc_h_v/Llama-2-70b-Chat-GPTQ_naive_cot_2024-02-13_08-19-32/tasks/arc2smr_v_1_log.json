The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, representing different colors.\n* Some pixels may have the value 0, which means they are background color.\n* Objects in the grid are defined as connected regions of pixels with the same color.\n* The task is to transform the input grid into a new grid, where the objects have changed in some way.\n* The output grid will also have the same structure as the input grid.\n\nNow, let's look at the examples provided:\n\nExample 1:\nThe input grid has a rectangular shape with a height of 7 and a width of 5. There are three objects in the grid: two objects with color 5 and one object with color 2. The objects are arranged vertically, with the top object (color 5) having a height of 3 and the bottom two objects (colors 5 and 2) having a height of 2 each.\n\nThe output grid is similar to the input grid, but with some changes:\n\n* The top object (color 5) has been shifted upwards by 2 rows.\n* The middle object (color 5) has been shifted downwards by 1 row.\n* The bottom object (color 2) has been shifted upwards by 1 row.\n* There are now five objects in total, including two new objects that were created by splitting the original objects.\n\nExample 2:\nThe input grid has a rectangular shape with a height of 8 and a width of 6. There are four objects in the grid: two objects with color 5 and two objects with color 6. The objects are arranged horizontally, with the left two objects (colors 5 and 6) having a width of 3 each, and the right two objects (colors 5 and 6) having a width of 2 each.\n\nThe output grid is similar to the input grid, but with some changes:\n\n* The leftmost object (color 5) has been stretched horizontally by a factor of 2.\n* The second object from the left (color 6) has been shrunk horizontally by a factor of 2.\n* The third object from the left (color 5) has been moved to the right by 2 positions.\n* The fourth object from the left (color 6) has been moved to the left by 2 positions.\n* There are still four objects in total, but their sizes and positions have changed.\n\nExample 3:\nThe input grid has a rectangular shape with a height of 6 and a width of 5. There are three objects in the grid: one object with color 5 and two objects with color 2. The objects are arranged vertically, with the top object (color 5) having a height of 3 and the bottom two objects (colors 2) having a height of 2 each.\n\nThe output grid is similar to the input grid, but with some changes:\n\n* The top object (color 5) has been shifted upwards by 1 row.\n* The middle object (color 2) has been shifted downwards by 1 row.\n* The bottom object (color 2) has been shifted upwards by 1 row.\n* There are still three objects in total, but their positions have changed.\n\nBased on these examples, it seems like the task is asking us to perform some basic geometric transformations on the objects in the grid, such as shifting, scaling, and flipping. However, there may be additional constraints or rules that we need to follow when applying these transformations.\n\nHere are some observations and thoughts about the problem:\n\n* The objects in the grid seem to be aligned with the grid lines, meaning that their edges are parallel to the grid lines.\n* The transformations applied to the objects in the examples are all symmetrical around either the x-axis, y-axis, or both.\n* In Example 1, the top object (color 5) was shifted upwards by 2 rows, which means that it now overlaps with the middle object (also color 5). It's possible that the task requires us to overlap objects in certain situations.\n* In Example 2, the leftmost object (color 5) was stretched horizontally by a factor of 2, which means that it now touches the second object (color 6) to its right. Again, this suggests that object overlap may be important in this task.\n* In Example 3, the top object (color 5) was shifted upwards by 1 row, which means that it no longer overlaps with the middle object (color 2). This suggests that preserving object overlap may not always be necessary.\n\nOverall, it seems like the task requires us to apply geometric transformations to objects in a grid while possibly taking into account factors such as object overlap and symmetry. However, without more information or examples, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer or solution strategy. Can you provide any further clarification or details?"
