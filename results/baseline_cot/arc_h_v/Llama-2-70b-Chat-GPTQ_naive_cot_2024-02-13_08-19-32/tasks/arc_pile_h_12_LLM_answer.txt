[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]
output: [[9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The first example has a horizontal line of three 9-valued pixels, followed by three 0-valued pixels, then a vertical line of three 8-valued pixels, and finally three more 0-valued pixels. The output grid has the top and bottom rows swapped, with the leftmost and rightmost columns inverted.",
"object_changes": "There are two objects in the input grid: a row of three 9-valued pixels and a column of three 8-valued pixels. In the output grid, these objects are swapped vertically."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The second example has a row of four 0-valued pixels, followed by a column of three 4-valued pixels, then another row of four 0-valued pixels, and finally a column of two 1-valued pixels. The output grid has the rows and columns permuted, with the 4-valued pixels moved to the top-left corner and the 1-valued pixels moved to the bottom-right corner.",
"object_changes": "There are three objects in the input grid: a row of four 0-valued pixels, a column of three 4-valued pixels, and a pair of diagonally adjacent 1-valued pixels. In the output grid, these objects are rearranged to form a 2x2 square of 4-valued pixels surrounded by a frame of 0-valued pixels, with the 1-valued pixels moved to the bottom-right corner."
},
"overall_pattern": "It appears that the input-output relationship involves reflecting the input grid around either the x-axis, y-axis, or both, while also permuting the rows and columns. Additionally, objects in the grid may be transformed by moving them to different locations, changing their size, or altering their orientation.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, we need to write a program that takes an input grid as a 2D NumPy array and applies the necessary transformations to produce the corresponding output grid. We can use NumPy's reshape() and transpose() methods to manipulate the grid's dimensions, and its indexing and slicing capabilities to access and modify specific regions of the grid. We may also need to use logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT to create masks for selecting certain pixels or objects in the grid.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid has six rows and five columns, with values ranging from 0 to 9. There are several objects in the grid, including a horizontal line of three 3-valued pixels, a vertical line of three 9-valued pixels, a 2x2 square of four 4-valued pixels, and a pair of diagonally adjacent 5-valued pixels.",
"test_case_object_view": "The objects in the grid include a row of three 3-valued pixels, a column of three 9-valued pixels, a 2x2 square of four 4-valued pixels, and a pair of diagonally adjacent 5-valued pixels. These objects have various sizes, shapes, and colors, and some of them overlap or touch each other.",
"test_case_transformation": "To transform the test input grid, we need to reflect it around the x-axis and y-axis, permute the rows and columns, and move or resize certain objects. Specifically, we need to swap the top and bottom rows, swap the left and right halves of the grid, move the 4-valued pixels to the top-left corner and the 1-valued pixels to the bottom-right corner, and rotate the 3-valued pixels clockwise by 90 degrees.",
"test_case_output": "The resulting output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid, but with the specified transformations applied to the pixels and objects. The output grid will contain the same values as the input grid, but with potentially different positions, sizes, and orientations of the objects." }
