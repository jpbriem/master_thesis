You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  The given input-output pairs exhibit a common pattern, suggesting a specific transformation rule. The task is to identify this rule and apply it to a new test case.

Analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can observe that:

* Each input grid has a rectangular shape with a height of 3 rows and a width of 5 columns.
* Each output grid also has a rectangular shape with a height of 3 rows and a width of 5 columns.
* In each input-output pair, there are two types of pixels: 0 and 1. Pixels with value 0 are transformed into pixels with value 2 in the output grid, while pixels with value 1 are transformed into pixels with value 1 in the output grid.
* There are no isolated pixels with value 1 in the input grid. All pixels with value 1 are connected to each other through their edges (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
* The transformation preserves the connectivity of pixels with value 1. For each connected component in the input grid, there corresponds a connected component in the output grid, containing the transformed pixels.
* The number of connected components in the input grid equals the number of connected components in the output grid.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rules for the transformation:

1. If a pixel with value 0 is surrounded by pixels with value 1, it becomes a pixel with value 2 in the output grid.
2. If a pixel with value 1 is surrounded by pixels with value 0, it remains unchanged in the output grid.
3. The connectivity of pixels with value 1 is preserved in the transformation.

Now, let's apply these rules to the test case input grid:

input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Applying the rules:

1. Pixels with value 0 surrounded by pixels with value 1 will become pixels with value 2 in the output grid. There are such pixels in the third row (position [1, 1]) and fifth column (positions [1, 3], [1, 4], and [1, 5]).
2. Pixels with value 1 surrounded by pixels with value 0 will remain unchanged in the output grid. These pixels are located in the second row (positions [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], and [1, 5]) and fourth row (positions [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], and [1, 5]).
3. Preserve the connectivity of pixels with value 1. This means that the connected components in the input grid must correspond to connected components in the output grid. We can see that there are three connected components in the input grid: two horizontal stripes (rows 1 and 3) and a vertical strip (column 1). These components must be transformed into three corresponding connected components in the output grid.

Using these rules, we can create the test output grid:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

The resulting output grid fulfills all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.
