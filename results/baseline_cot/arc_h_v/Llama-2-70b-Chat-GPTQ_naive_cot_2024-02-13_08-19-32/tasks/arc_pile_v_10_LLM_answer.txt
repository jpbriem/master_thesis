[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7], [8, 4, 1, 3, 2, 7]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4], [0, 9, 0, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 8, 7, 0], [0, 6, 8, 7, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 9, 8, 4], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]

Sample Outputs:
  {
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has a vertical line of color 4, surrounded by color 0. The output grid maintains this structure but shifts the line upwards and adds a new row of color 4 at the bottom.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 4, with a size of 3x2 pixels. In the output grid, it is transformed into two objects - a 2x2 square in the top-left corner and a 2x3 rectangle in the bottom-right corner, both still colored 4."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid contains a 2x2 block of color 9 in the middle, surrounded by color 0. The output grid keeps the same structure but replaces the central 2x2 block with color 4.",
"object_changes": "There is one object in the input grid, colored 9, with a size of 2x2 pixels. In the output grid, it is transformed into an object of the same size and position, but now colored 4."
},
"overall_pattern": "The input-output relationship appears to involve transforming objects while preserving their original position and size, but changing their color. Additionally, there may be some translation or rotation involved in the transformation process.",
"instructions": "To solve this task, we need to identify the objects in the input grid, determine their properties such as color, size, and position, and then apply the appropriate transformation rules to create the output grid. We should pay attention to the way objects are arranged in the grid, including any symmetries or patterns, and ensure that the output grid maintains the same structure but with the specified changes.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[[7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 9, 8, 4], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The test input grid consists of six rows and five columns, with values ranging from 0 to 9. There are three objects in the grid - two horizontal stripes of color 7, a vertical stripe of color 2, and a small 2x2 block of color 3 in the bottom-left corner. The rest of the grid is filled with color 0.",
"test_case_object_view": "The three objects in the grid are:

1. A horizontal stripe of color 7, spanning rows 1-3 and columns 1-2. It has a size of 3x2 pixels and coordinates (1,1) to (3,2).
2. Another horizontal stripe of color 7, spanning rows 4-6 and columns 1-2. It has the same size and coordinates as the first stripe.
3. A 2x2 block of color 3, located at coordinates (4,1) to (5,2).",
"test_case_transformation": "Applying the transformation rules to the objects in the test input grid, we get:

1. The first horizontal stripe of color 7 remains unchanged.
2. The second horizontal stripe of color 7 is translated upwards by 2 rows and becomes a 3x2 rectangle, with coordinates (1,3) to (3,5).
3. The 2x2 block of color 3 is replaced by a 2x3 rectangle of color 4, with coordinates (4,1) to (6,4).",
"test_case_output": "The resulting output grid is:

[[7, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 9, 8, 4], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]"
