You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.
* There are also pixels with a value of 0, which represent the background color.
* The task is to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid, using a set of rules that we need to infer from the given examples.
* The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid.
* Objects are defined as connected pixels of the same color, and can be adjacent or non-adjacent.
* The transformation can involve copying, repeating, scaling, rotating, translating, or combining objects, as well as creating new objects or removing existing ones.

Based on the given examples, here are some observations and deductions:

* In all three examples, the input grid has a rectangular shape with a 3x3 square of objects in the center.
* Each object in the input grid is transformed into a corresponding object in the output grid, with the same position and size.
* The objects in the output grid are always arranged in a 3x3 square, regardless of their positions in the input grid.
* The background color (represented by a value of 0) is preserved in the output grid.
* The transformation seems to preserve the overall structure of the input grid, while changing the positions and sizes of the objects.

From these observations, we can make some educated guesses about the rules governing the transformation:

1. Objects in the input grid are transformed into corresponding objects in the output grid, preserving their positions and sizes.
2. The background color is preserved in the output grid.
3. The transformation preserves the overall structure of the input grid, including the positions and sizes of the objects.
4. The transformation can involve copying, repeating, scaling, rotating, translating, or combining objects, as well as creating new objects or removing existing ones.

Now, let's try to apply these rules to the test input grid you provided:

input: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]]

Using the rules we inferred earlier, we can create a possible output grid as follows:

output: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]]

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid ways to transform the input grid based on the given rules.
