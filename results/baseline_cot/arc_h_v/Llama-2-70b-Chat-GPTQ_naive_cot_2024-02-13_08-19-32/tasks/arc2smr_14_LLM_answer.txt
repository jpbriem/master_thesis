[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  The given input-output pairs represent a pattern recognition problem. The task is to identify the underlying pattern in the input-output pairs and apply it to a new input grid to produce an output grid.

From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the pattern involves replacing certain blocks of pixels with other blocks. Specifically, the pattern recognizes certain shapes made up of connected pixels of the same color, and replaces them with a different shape made up of connected pixels of a different color. The replaced shapes are always surrounded by a border of zero-valued pixels.

To formalize this pattern, we can define a few concepts:

* A "shape" is a set of connected pixels of the same color.
* A "border" is a set of pixels surrounding a shape, such that every pixel in the border is zero-valued.
* A "replacement" is a new shape that is placed in the position of the original shape, with a different color.

Using these concepts, we can describe the pattern as follows:

1. Find all shapes in the input grid.
2. For each shape, find the border pixels surrounding it.
3. Replace the shape and its border with a new shape and border, respectively, using a different color.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more shapes can be found.

Based on this pattern, we can create a algorithm to generate the output grid for a given input grid. Here's an outline of the algorithm:

1. Initialize the output grid with zeros.
2. Iterate over the pixels in the input grid.
3. If a pixel has a non-zero value, mark it and its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonally) as "visited".
4. Starting from the top-left corner, iterate over the rows and columns of the input grid, looking for sequences of visited pixels that form shapes.
5. For each shape, find the border pixels surrounding it, and replace the shape and its border with a new shape and border, respectively, using a different color.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until no more shapes can be found.
7. Return the output grid.

Here's an example of how the algorithm would work for the first input-output pair:
