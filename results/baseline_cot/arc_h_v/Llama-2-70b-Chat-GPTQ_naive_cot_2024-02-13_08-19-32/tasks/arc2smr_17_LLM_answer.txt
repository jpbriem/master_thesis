You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.
* There are also pixels with a value of 0, which represent the background color.
* The task is to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid, based on a set of rules that we need to infer.
* The input and output grids have the same size, and the transformation should be done in a way that preserves the overall pattern of the grid.

Now, let's take a closer look at the input grid. We can see that there are several objects in the grid, each represented by a contiguous set of pixels with the same color. The objects seem to be arranged in a random manner, and they vary in size and shape. Some objects touch each other, while others are separated by empty spaces.

Based on this observation, we can make some educated guesses about the rules that govern the transformation of the grid. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Color-based transformation: The transformation could be based on the colors of the objects in the grid. For example, the output grid could have the same objects, but with different colors. Alternatively, the transformation could create new objects or modify existing ones based on their colors.
2. Shape-based transformation: The transformation could be based on the shapes of the objects in the grid. For example, the output grid could have objects with different shapes, sizes, or orientations.
3. Position-based transformation: The transformation could be based on the positions of the objects in the grid. For example, the output grid could have the same objects, but shifted or rotated relative to the input grid.
4. Combinatorial transformation: The transformation could combine elements from different objects in the grid to create new objects or patterns.

These are just a few ideas, and there may be many other possible approaches to solving this problem. To determine the correct approach, we need more information about the desired output grid.

Can you provide any additional details or constraints about the output grid? For example, are there any specific objects or patterns that should be preserved or created in the output grid? Are there any restrictions on the colors or shapes of the objects in the output grid? Any additional information will help us narrow down the possible solutions and find the correct approach.
