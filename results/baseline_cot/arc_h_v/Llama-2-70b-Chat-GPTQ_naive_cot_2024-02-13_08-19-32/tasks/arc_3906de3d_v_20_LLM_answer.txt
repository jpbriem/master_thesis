[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  This is an interesting problem! I'll do my best to help you solve it.

First, let's summarize what we know so far:

* We have a 2D grid of pixels with values from 1 to 9, where each value corresponds to a specific color.
* There are also pixels with a value of 0, which represent the background color.
* The task is to transform the input grid into a corresponding output grid, based on a set of rules that we need to infer.
* The input and output grids have the same size, and the transformation should be done in a way that preserves the overall pattern of the grid.

Now, let's take a closer look at the input grid:

* The first row has values 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0.
* The second row has values 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0.
* The third row has values 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0.
* The fourth row has values 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0.
* The fifth row has values 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0.
* The sixth row has values 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0.
* The seventh row has values 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0.
* The eighth row has values 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0.
* The ninth row has values 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0.

Based on this input grid, we can observe some patterns:

* There are three rows with identical values (rows 1-3).
* There are three columns with identical values (columns 1-3).
* There is a diagonal pattern of values from top-left to bottom-right (values 3, 3, 3, 3, 3).
* There is a horizontal pattern of values from left to right (values 0, 3, 3, 3, 3).
* There is a vertical pattern of values from top to bottom (values 0, 0, 0, 3, 3).

Now, let's try to infer the rule for transforming the input grid into the output grid. Based on the patterns we observed, it seems like the transformation involves copying certain parts of the grid and shifting them around. Specifically:

* Row 1 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 2.
* Row 2 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 3.
* Row 3 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 4.
* Row 4 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 5.
* Row 5 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 6.
* Row 6 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 7.
* Row 7 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 8.
* Row 8 is copied and shifted upwards to become row 9.

Using this rule, we can create the output grid by applying the transformation to each row of the input grid. Here's the resulting output grid:
