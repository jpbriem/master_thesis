The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

You've provided us with an interesting challenge. Based on the given examples and the requirements you've described, we can infer that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid while preserving certain properties.\n\nTo approach this problem, we can break it down into several steps:\n\n1. Understanding the input data: We need to analyze the structure of the input grid, including the number of rows and columns, the range of pixel values (e.g., 0, 1, 2,..., 9), and any additional constraints such as symmetry or repetition.\n2. Identifying the transformation rules: Based on the examples provided, we can identify some common transformation patterns, such as shifting, scaling, rotation, and more complex operations like ellipse fitting or touching objects.\n3. Developing a transformation algorithm: We can design an algorithm that takes the input grid as input and applies the identified transformation rules to produce the corresponding output grid. This may involve iterating over each pixel in the input grid, applying the appropriate transformation operation, and updating the corresponding pixel in the output grid accordingly.\n4. Testing and refining the algorithm: To ensure that the algorithm produces accurate results, we can create test cases by providing additional inputs and checking the output grid, and comparing the algorithm's predictions to the actual output.\n\nSome possible transformation rules include:\n\n* Shift(x, y): Move x, 0 copies of the input pixel by y-coordinates.\n* Scale(x, y): Resize the input grid horizontally by a factor of 2, keeping objects.\n* Rotate(x, y): Rotate the input grid by angle.\n* Mirror(x, y): Mirror the input grid horizontally.\n* Ellipse(x, y): Fit an ellipse.\n\nWe can also consider the geometric and topological structure of the input grid of pixels of the output grid, we can be transformed into a new coordinate system, and topological structure of the output grid, and preserve their original grid, and keep track, and preserve the output grid, and keep track, and preserve the output grid, and track, and keep the output grid, and track, and preserve the output grid, and keep the output grid, and track, and keep the output grid, and the same structure of the track, and keep the grid, and keep the track, and preserve the output, \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand keep track,
