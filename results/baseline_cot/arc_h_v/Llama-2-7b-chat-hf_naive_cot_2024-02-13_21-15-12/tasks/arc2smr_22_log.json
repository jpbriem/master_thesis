The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

Based on the provided examples and test cases, I will now explain the transformation pattern and provide the required transformations for each input grid.\n\nInput-Output Pattern:\nThe given tasks involve transforming an input grid of pixels into an output grid of pixels, where each pixel value corresponds to a specific color or object category. The transformation can include various geometric and topological operations, such as line segments, rectangle resizing, touching objects, noise pixels, and more. Additionally, there may be conditional transformations based on the input values themselves, like counting, sorting, or mirroring.\n\nRequired Transformations:\n\nFor each input grid, please perform the following transformations:\n\n1. **Geometric and Topological Operations**:\na. Apply the specified transformations to each line segment in the input grid:\ni. For each line segment, add a random offset (uniformly distributed between -1 and 1) to both ends of the segment.\nii. For each line segment, rotate it by a randomly generated angle (uniformly distributed between 0 and 360 degrees).\niii. For each line segment, reflect it vertically or horizontally once.\niv. For each line segment, stretch it by a randomly generated factor (between 0.8 and 1.2).\nv. For each line segment, flip it horizontally or vertically once.\nb. Apply the same operations to each rectangle in the input grid:\ni. For each rectangle, add a random offset (uniformly distributed between -1 and 1) to its center coordinate.\nii. For each rectangle, rotate it by a randomly generated angle (uniformly distributed between 0 and 360 degrees).\niii. For each rectangle, reflect it vertically or horizontally once.\niv. For each rectangle, stretch it by a randomly generated factor (between 0.8 and 1.2).\nv. For each rectangle, flip it horizontally or vertically once.\n2. **Color Categories**:\na. Assign a unique color to each object in the input grid based on the following rules:\ni. If the object has exactly 3 neighboring pixels of the same color, assign it that color.\nii. Otherwise, generate a new color using the HSL color model (Hue = 0\u00b0, Saturation = 0.5, Lightness = 0.5).\nb. For each object, adjust its color intensity according to the following probability distribution:\ni. If the object's color is red, increase its intensity by a randomly generated factor (between 0.8 and 1.2).\nii. If the object's color is green, decrease its intensity by a randomly generated factor (between 0.8 and 1.2).\niii. If the object's color is blue, keep its intensity unchanged.\n3. **Noise Pixels**:\na. Add noise pixels to the input grid according to the following rules:\ni. Generate a random grayscale value between 0 and 1.\nii. Set the noise pixel's color to the generated value.\niii. Place the noise pixel at a random location within the input grid's boundaries.\n4. **Conditional Transformations**:\na. Apply the following transformations conditionally based on the input values:\ni. If the input value is greater than 0.5, apply the following transformation:\n(x, y) -> (x + 1, y + 1).\nii. If the input value is less than or equal to 0, apply the following transformation:\n(x, y) -> (x + 1, y + 1).\n\nPlease implement these transformations on the given input grid, and output a transformed grid.\n\nIn summary, the task involves applying various geometric and topological operations to the input grid, followed by assigning unique color categories, and conditional transformations based on the values."
