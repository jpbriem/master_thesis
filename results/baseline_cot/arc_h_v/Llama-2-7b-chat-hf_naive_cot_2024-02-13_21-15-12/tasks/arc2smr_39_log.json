The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0,

grids as follows:\n\nInput Grid:\n\n* Each row represents an object, where each column corresponds to a pixel value.\n* The pixel values range from 1 to 9, representing different colors and shades.\n* There are no noise pixels.\n\nOutput Grid:\n\n* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n* For each pixel in the input grid, there exists a corresponding pixel in the output grid with the same color and shade.\n* The output grid may contain additional features such as lines, rectangles, or other shapes that do not exist in the input grid.\n\nIn terms of the logical pattern, I can identify the following concepts:\n\n* Geometry and topology:\n\t+ Lines: Connecting pixels of the same color or shade.\n\t+ Rectangles: Enclosing groups of pixels with the same color or shade.\n\t+ Symmetry: Reflecting objects or shapes around vertical or horizontal axes.\n\t+ Mirroring: Flipping objects or shapes over a vertical or horizontal axis.\n\t+ Rotation: Turning objects or shapes around a central point.\n\t+ Translation: Moving objects or shapes along a straight line or distance.\n* Objects:\n\t+ Pixels are grouped together based on their color or shade to form objects.\n\t+ Objects are connected by shared edges or corners.\n\t+ Objects may overlap or touch each other.\n* Arithmetic operations:\n\t+ Counting: Determining the number of pixels with a specific color or shade.\n\t+ Sorting: Organizing pixels or objects based on their color or shade.\n\nBased on these concepts, I can provide the following descriptions for the input and output grids:\n\nInput Grid Description:\n\n* Pixels are arranged in rows and columns, with each pixel having a unique color or shade value ranging from 1 to 9.\n* Some pixels form lines, rectangles, or other shapes based on their color or shade similarity.\n* Noise pixels do not exist in the input grid.\n\nOutput Grid Description:\n\n* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with each pixel corresponding to a specific color or shade value.\n* Additional features such as lines, rectangles, or other shapes may appear in the output grid, which do not exist in the input grid.\n* The output grid preserves the overall structure and layout of the input grid while introducing new elements and patterns.\n\nFor the test cases, I can provide the following descriptions:\n\nTest Case 1 Input Grid:\n\n* A grid of white pixels with some black pixels scattered throughout.\n* Some white pixels form lines or rectangles based on their color similarity.\n\nTest Case 1 Output Grid:\n\n* A grid of white pixels with some black pixels scattered throughout, but with additional lines, rectangles, or other shapes appearing in the output grid.\n\nTest Case 2 Input Grid:\n\n* A grid of blue pixels with some red pixels scattered throughout.\n* Some blue pixels form lines or rectangles based on their color similarity.\n\nTest Case 2 Output Grid:\n\n* A grid of blue pixels with some red pixels scattered throughout, but with additional lines, rectangles, or other shapes appearing in the output grid.\n\nTest Case 3 Input Grid:\n\n* A grid of green pixels with some yellow pixels scattered throughout.\n* Some green pixels form lines or rectangles based on their color similarity.\n\nTest Case 3 Output Grid:\n\n* A grid of green pixels with some yellow pixels scattered throughout, but with additional lines, rectangles, or other shapes appearing in the output grid."
