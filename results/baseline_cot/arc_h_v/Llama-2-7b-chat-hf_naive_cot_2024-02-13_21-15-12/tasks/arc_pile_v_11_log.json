The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [8, 0, 9, 3, 0, 7], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [8, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0], [8, 6, 9, 3, 0, 7]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 6]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 5, 6]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 3, 8, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 9, 7, 4], [0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4], [0, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4], [0, 3, 8, 9, 7, 4]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the description of the transformation pattern, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids. Then, I will transform the test input grid into its test output grid using the inference.\n\nFor the test input grid provided, the relation between the input and output grids can be described as follows:\n\n* The input grid has a total of 5 rows and 4 columns, while the output grid has a total of 5 rows and 4 columns as well.\n* Each pixel value in the input grid corresponds to a specific color or object in the output grid, where 0 represents the background color.\n* The objects in the output grid are formed by connecting neighboring pixels of the same color, and their sizes and positions are preserved in the transformation.\n* The transformation also involves some noise pixels that do not affect the overall pattern but may change the color of nearby pixels slightly.\n\nUsing these observations, I will now transform the test input grid into its test output grid as follows:\n\nInput grid: [[2, 0, 1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 1, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5]]\n\nOutput grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 4, 1, 9, 5], [2, 0, 1, 9, 5]]\n\nAs requested, I will provide the descriptions of the input-output relationships for each example pair, as well as the instructions for the transformation actions.\n\nExample 1:\nInput-output relationship: The input grid is transformed into an output grid where each pixel value is shifted by one unit in either the horizontal or vertical direction. The objects in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, but their positions may be affected by the shifting.\n\nInstructions: Perform a series of horizontal and vertical shifts on the input grid, such that each pixel value is moved by one unit in either the horizontal or vertical direction.\n\nExample 2:\nInput-output relationship: The input grid is transformed into an output grid where each pixel value is multiplied by a constant factor. The objects in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, but their sizes may be affected by the scaling.\n\nInstructions: Apply a series of constant factors to each pixel value in the input grid, such that the resulting pixel values in the output grid are proportional to the original pixel values in the input grid.\n\nExample 3:\nInput-output relationship: The input grid is transformed into an output grid where each pixel value is replaced by a new color based on a specified rule. The objects in the input grid are not preserved in the output grid, as they are broken up and reassembled according to the specified rule.\n\nInstructions: Define a rule that specifies the new color of each pixel value in the input grid based on the surrounding pixel values. For example, you could use a simple algorithm that assigns each pixel value to one of three colors based on the colors of the nearest neighbors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
