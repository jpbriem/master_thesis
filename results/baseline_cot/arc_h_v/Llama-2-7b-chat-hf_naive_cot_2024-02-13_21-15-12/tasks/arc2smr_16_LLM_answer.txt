[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the requirements you've described, we can infer that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid while preserving certain properties.

To solve this problem, we can employ various techniques such as geometric transformations, color manipulation, and pattern recognition. Here's a high-level approach to tackle this challenge:

1. **Geometric transformations**: Since the input and output grids have values from 0 to 9, we can apply basic geometric transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to the input grid. These operations will help us understand the relationships between the pixels and their neighbors.
2. **Color manipulation**: We need to preserve the color distribution in the output grid. To do so, we can use techniques like histogram equalization, which redistributes the pixel values to create a more uniform color palette. This step will help us identify the dominant colors in the input grid and ensure they are preserved in the output grid.
3. **Pattern recognition**: The input grid may contain various patterns, such as lines, curves, or shapes. By analyzing these patterns, we can determine how to transform the input grid to produce the desired output. For instance, if the input grid contains a line, we can translate it horizontally or vertically to create a similar pattern in the output grid.
4. **Object detection**: The input grid may contain objects, represented by clusters of neighboring pixels with specific colors. We can detect these objects by identifying connected components and counting the number of pixels in each component. Once we identify the objects, we can transform them accordingly.
5. **Shape upscaling or instance**: If the input grid has a non-uniform scale factor, we can apply a geometric transformation to the output grid.
6. **Copying**: If the input grid has a copy of a specific object, we can copy the object.
7. **Sorting**: We can sort the pixels in the input grid based on their colors.
8. **Transforming arithmethods**: We can apply a series of transformations to the input grid.

Based on the above steps, we can develop a sequence of transformations to create the output grid.

Now, let's required transformation.
