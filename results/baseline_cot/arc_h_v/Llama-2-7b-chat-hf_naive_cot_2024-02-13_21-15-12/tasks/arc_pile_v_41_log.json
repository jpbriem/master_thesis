The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

The transformation can involve various geometric and topological operations, including lines, rectangles, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, and more. Additionally, there may be conditional transformations based on the specific input and output pairs.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the input grid: I will carefully examine the input grid and identify the objects, their sizes, colors, and positions. I will also note any other relevant features, such as noise pixels or edges.\n2. Determine the transformation pattern: Based on the examples provided, I will look for common patterns in the input and output grids. These patterns could include repeated shapes, mirrored objects, translated structures, or other geometric transformations.\n3. Apply the transformation: Using the identified patterns, I will apply the appropriate transformations to the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid. This may involve using mathematical operations, such as scaling, shifting, or rotating, or combining multiple transformations to achieve the desired result.\n4. Validate the output: Once I have generated the output grid, I will compare it to the expected output to ensure that it matches the described pattern. If necessary, I will refine my transformation approach until the output accurately reflects the desired pattern.\n\nFor the given test case, the input grid is:\n```json\n[[7, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2], [7, 0, 3, 0]]\n```\nBased on the examples provided, I expect the output grid to have the following changes:\n\n* Objects: The two objects in the input grid (represented by the numbers 2 and 3) will be transformed into larger versions of themselves, maintaining their original colors and positions.\n* Shapes: The rectangular shapes formed by the objects will be preserved, but may experience some stretching or shrinking due to the transformation.\n* Colors: The colors of the objects and surrounding pixels will remain consistent, with no significant changes.\n\nTo implement these transformations, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input grid: In this case, there are two objects, each represented by a unique number (2 and 3).\n2. Determine the transformation parameters: Based on the examples provided, I will scale both objects by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions. This means that each object will be twice as large as it was in the input grid.\n3. Apply the transformation: Using the transformed object coordinates and sizes, I will update the corresponding pixels in the output grid. For instance, the top-left corner of the first object (coordinates [0, 0]) will become [0, 0 + 2 * 2 = 4], and so on.\n4. Refine the transformation as needed: Depending on the specific implementation, additional adjustments may be necessary to ensure that the output grid matches the expected pattern.\n\nHere is the resulting output grid for the given test case:\n```json\n[[0, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 3, 0], [7, 0, 0, 2], [7, 0, 3, 0]]\n```\nIn summary, the transformation pattern for this test case involves scaling both objects by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, while preserving their original colors and positions."
