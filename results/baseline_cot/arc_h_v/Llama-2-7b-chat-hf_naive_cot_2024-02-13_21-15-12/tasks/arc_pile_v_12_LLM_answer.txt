You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.

Based on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, I understand that the task is to transform a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while applying certain geometric and topological transformations. These transformations include:

* Lines, rectangular shapes, and orthogonal projections
* Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, and translations
* Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions
* Containing or being contained within a perimeter
* Copying and repeating patterns

To solve this problem, I will need to perform the following steps:

Step 1: Understand the Input Grid
I will carefully examine the input grid and identify the objects present in it. Based on the given examples, I understand that objects are defined as adjacent pixels of the same color. I will also note the size, coordinate, and shape of each object.

Step 2: Apply Transformations
Using the given transformations, I will apply them to the input grid. This may involve stretching, shrinking, flipping, rotating, or moving the grid elements. I will ensure that these transformations are consistent across the entire grid and that they result in a valid output.

Step 3: Observe Changes
After applying the transformations, I will observe the changes in the output grid compared to the input grid. I will pay particular attention to any patterns that emerge or change during the transformation process.

Step 4: Describe Transformation Steps
For each input-output pair, I will provide detailed steps explaining how the transformation was applied. These steps will outline the specific geometric and topological operations performed on the input grid to produce the corresponding output.

Step 5: Test Cases
I will create test cases for the input-output pairs provided in the problem statement. For each test case, I will apply the transformations described above and verify that the resulting output matches the expected output.

Here are the test cases and their corresponding outputs:

Test Case 1:
Input: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8]]

Test Case 2:
Input: [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 0], [8, 0, 1, 4, 0]]

Test Case 3:
Input: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [8, 0, 1, 4, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0]]

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern observed in the input-output pairs is that the transformations tend to preserve the overall structure of the grid while introducing new patterns through the application of geometric and topological operations.

Instructions:
Given an input grid of pixels, transform it into an equivalent output grid using the specified transformations. Output the resulting grid as a NumPy array.

Test Case Input Copy:
Copy the input grid provided in the problem statement.

Test Case Grid View:
Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.

Test Case Object View:
Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.

Transformations:

* Line: Draw lines connecting adjacent pixels of the same color.
* Rectangular Shapes: Draw rectangles around groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.
* Orthogonal Projections: Project the grid onto a plane passing through the origin, preserving the relative positions of the pixels.
* Symmetries: Reflect the grid about horizontal, vertical, or diagonal axes.
* Mirroring: Flip the grid over a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal axis.
* Rotations: Rotate the grid about the origin by a fixed angle.
* Translations: Move the grid by a fixed amount in the x, y, or z direction.
* Containing / Being Contained: Check if a given pixel is contained within a larger rectangle formed by adjacent pixels of the same color.
* Copying: Create a copy of the grid with the same layout but with all pixels set to the same value.
* Repeating: Repeat the grid pattern a fixed number of times in both the x and y directions.

Arithmetic Operations:
Perform arithmetic operations on the grid, such as counting the number of pixels of each color, sorting the pixels by color, or copying the grid and adding noise to it.

In summary, the goal is to transform an input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid using various geometric and topological transformations, while paying close attention to the formation of patterns and the properties of objects within the grid.
