The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 5, 5, 0]]\noutput: [[4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given examples and instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then transform the test input grid into its corresponding output grid.\n\nThe relation between the input and output grids seems to be based on geometric transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and translation. These transformations are applied to individual objects or groups of objects in the grid, resulting in changed patterns and shapes. Additionally, there may be conditional transformations based on the colors of the pixels or objects.\n\nFor the test input grid provided, I will describe the changes between the input and output pixels, objects, and overall patterns.\n\nInput Grid:\n\n| 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 7 |\n| 9 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 9 |\n| 0 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 0 |\n\nOutput Grid:\n\n| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 |\n\nChanges between Input and Output Pixels:\n\n* All pixels in the output grid have a different color than their corresponding pixel in the input grid.\n* Some pixels in the output grid have a new color that is not present in the input grid (e.g., pixel at position (2, 3) in the output grid has color 7).\n* Some pixels in the output grid have a different shade or hue than their corresponding pixel in the input grid (e.g., pixel at position (1, 2) in the output grid has a darker shade of blue than its corresponding pixel in the input grid).\n\nChanges between Input and Output Objects:\n\n* There are four objects in the input grid, each consisting of three or more adjacent pixels with the same color. In the output grid, these objects have been transformed and resized, but their overall shape and color remain the same.\n* The objects in the output grid are slightly shifted and rotated compared to their counterparts in the input grid.\n* The size of some objects in the output grid is larger or smaller than their counterparts in the input grid.\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern of the input and output grids is similar, with a grid structure and alternating light and dark colors. However, the output grid exhibits some distortion and transformation of the original patterns, particularly around the edges and corners of the grid.\n\nInstructions:\nTo transform the input grid into the output grid, you must apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Scale the input grid by a factor of 1.5 in both dimensions.\nStep 2: Rotate the scaled grid by 45 degrees clockwise around the origin.\nStep 3: Translate the rotated grid by 2 units in the x-direction and 3 units in the y-direction.\nStep 4: Apply a random noise perturbation to the translated grid.\nStep 5: Resize the perturbed grid by a factor of 0.8 in both dimensions.\nStep 6: Repeat Steps 1-5 multiple times to create additional iterations of the transformation.\n\nTest Case Output:\nThe resulting output grid after applying the above transformation steps is:\n\n| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 |\n\nNote that this is just one possible output for the given input grid, and the actual output may vary depending on the specific implementation of the transformation algorithm."
