The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[7, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 9], [7, 0, 2, 9]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 4], [8, 0, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[7, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the test input grid accordingly.\n\nThe transformation pattern appears to involve geometric and topological operations such as lines, rectangles, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, upscaling, and elastic distortions. Additionally, there are arithmetical operations based on objects or shapes, including counting, sorting, and touching objects.\n\nFor the test input grid, I will describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes, and the movements and transformations of objects.\n\nInput Grid:\n```json\n[[7, 0, 2, 5, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 4, 2, 0, 6],\n [0, 0, 0, 5, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]]\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 2, 5, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 5, 6],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nRegarding the first example, the input grid has four objects: two rectangles of size (2, 2) and (2, 1), and two squares of side length 2. The output grid also contains four objects, but their sizes and positions have changed due to the transformation. Specifically, the rectangle of size (2, 2) has moved upwards and rightwards, while the square of side length 2 has been stretched horizontally and vertically.\n\nFor the second example, the input grid consists of a single rectangle of size (4, 4). The output grid also contains a single rectangle of the same size, but it has been rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nFor the third example, the input grid has five objects: two rectangles of size (2, 2), two squares of side length 2, and one rectangle of size (3, 2). The output grid also contains five objects, but their positions and sizes have changed due to the transformation. Specifically, the two rectangles of size (2, 2) have moved towards the top-left corner and expanded horizontally, while the two squares of side length 2 have been stretched horizontally and vertically. The remaining rectangle of size (3, 2) has been rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees.\n\nBased on these observations, I will transform the test input grid according to the given instruction:\n\n* Upscale the grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n* Apply an elastic distortion to the grid, stretching it by a factor of 1.5 in the x direction and shrinking it by a factor of 1.2 in the y direction.\n* Rotate the grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees around the origin.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 2, 5, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 5, 6],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance."
