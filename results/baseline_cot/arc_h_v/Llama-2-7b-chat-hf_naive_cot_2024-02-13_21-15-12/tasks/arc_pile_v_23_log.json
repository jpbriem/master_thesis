The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 1]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 3, 0, 1]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 1], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[3, 9, 5, 0], [3, 0, 5, 2], [3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 9, 5, 2]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given examples and instructions, I understand that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while preserving certain properties such as color, shape, and object structure. The transformation can involve various geometric and topological operations, including lines, rectangles, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, upscaling, downscaling, elastic distortions, containing, being contained, and touching objects. Additionally, there may be noise pixels and arithmetical operations based on objects or shapes.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the Input Grid\nI will carefully examine the input grid and identify the objects present in it. I will also note the color palette used in the grid, including the background color and the colors used for each object.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Transformation Pattern\nBased on the examples provided, I will look for common patterns in the input and output grids. For instance, in Example 1, both grids have a repeating pattern of alternating colors, with each row having two colors repeated twice. In Example 2, the input grid has a simple symmetry about the vertical axis, while the output grid has a more complex symmetry involving rotation and reflection. In Example 3, the input grid has multiple connected objects, while the output grid has larger versions of those objects.\n\nStep 3: Develop a Transformation Plan\nUsing the observed patterns and the given instructions, I will create a plan for transforming the input grid into the desired output grid. This plan may involve a combination of geometric and topological operations, such as stretching, shrinking, flipping, rotating, and moving objects around. I will also consider the noise pixels and their impact on the overall transformation.\n\nStep 4: Apply the Transformation\nUsing the developed plan, I will apply the transformation to the input grid, element by element. I will ensure that the colors, shapes, and object structures are preserved during the transformation process. If necessary, I will adjust the transformation parameters to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nStep 5: Validate the Output\nAfter applying the transformation, I will validate the output grid against the expected result. I will check if the colors, shapes, and object structures match the expected output, and make any necessary adjustments to the transformation plan.\n\nHere are the descriptions of the input and output grids for the given test case:\n\nTest Case Input Grid:\n[[3, 9, 5, 0], [3, 0, 5, 2], [3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 9, 5, 2]]\n\nTest Case Output Grid:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [0, 3, 4, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nIn this test case, the input grid has four objects: two rectangles and two squares. The output grid has the same objects, but with slightly different sizes and positions due to the transformation applied. The colors remain unchanged throughout the process."
