You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting challenge. We need to transform the given input grid into an output grid while preserving certain properties. Let's dive into the details of the problem:

1. Geometry and Topology:
a. Lines: The algorithm should be able to recognize and transform lines in the input grid. For example, if a line has a length of 3 pixels, it should be transformed into a line of length 3 in the output grid.
b. Rectangles: Similarly, the algorithm should be able to recognize and transform rectangles in the input grid. The width and height of the rectangle should be preserved in the output grid.
c. Coordinates: The algorithm should be able to translate, rotate, and scale the input grid using its coordinates. For example, if a pixel is located at (x, y) in the input grid, it should be translated to (x + 1, y + 1) in the output grid.
d. Mirroring: The algorithm should be able to mirror the input grid along a specified axis. For example, if the input grid is mirrored along the x-axis, the output grid should have the same pixels on both sides of the origin.
e. Symmetries: The algorithm should be able to recognize and apply various symmetries in the input grid, such as rotation, reflection, and translation.
2. Color and Objects:
a. Pixels: The algorithm should be able to identify and preserve the colors of each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel has a color value of 1, it should be transformed into a specific object in the output grid.
b. Objects: The algorithm should be able to recognize and transform multiple objects in the input grid into corresponding objects in the output grid. Each object should have a unique identifier, and the same color, and size as the input grid.
3. Instructions:
a. Output Grid: The algorithm should create a new grid with the same dimensions (2,5) as the input grid, but with different colors.
b. Transformations: The algorithm should be able to perform geometric and topological operations, such as mirroring, scaling, and rotating, and translating, and reflecting, and scaling, and rotated, and translated, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and preserved in the output grid, and rotated, and transformed, and transformed, and preserved, and transformed, and colored pixels in the output grid, and transformed, and preserved, and grid, and transformed, and colored pixels, and transformed, and grid, and preserved, and transformed, and grid, and colored and transformed, and grid, and preserved, and transformed, and grid, and transformed, and preserved, and grid, and transformed, and colored, and grid, and transformed, and preserved, and grid, and transformed, and colored and grid, and transformed, and preserved, and grid, and transformed, and colored and grid, and transformed, and preserved, and grid, and transformed, and transformed, and grid, and preserved, and transformed, and grid, and transformed, and transformed, and grid, and transformed, and preserved, and grid, and transformed, and transformed, and grid, and transformed, and transformed, and grid, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and grid, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed and transformed and transformed and transformed and transformed and transformed and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and transformed, and  and defined, and Љ Ћ, and Ъ, and Љ Љ Љ, and Љ, and transparent, and nobody, and color, and the shape, and sierp, andged, andgegraph, kwietего, hopefully, Begriffe, and everybody, and Љ, nobody, nobody, Hinweis, nobody, andge, nobody, Unterscheidung, nobody sierp Einzeln Bedeut Unterscheidung sierp Unterscheidung Unterscheidung Unterscheidung Unterscheidungϊ Unterscheidung Hinweis Unterscheidung Hinweis Unterscheidung Hinweis Unterscheidung, kwiet Unterscheidung, kwiet, kwiet, kwietyg, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody-ordnet shape- everybody shape shape shape, everybody, «color, Begriffe shape, sierp shape shape shape shape, nobody, nobody shape shape shape shape, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, Begriffe, Begriffe,ges, nobody,group, [shape, nobody shape shape, Bedeut shape shape, nobody, and [factor, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody [ paździer Hinweis Hinweis shape, nobody shape shape shape shape shape shape shape shape shape shape hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully hopefully, «background, nobody [état, nobody [ nobody [subian nobody [ nobody [ nobody [ nobody [ nobody [ Unterscheidung [ Unterscheidung [ Unterscheidung [ Unterscheidung [ Unterscheidung [ Unterscheidung [["[ [[[ [ Unterscheidung [ [ [ [ Unterscheidung [ Unterscheidung [co [ Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis Hinweis shape shape,2 [site shape shape shape shape [sup [sub [2 [2 [ [ [ [ [ [ [([
