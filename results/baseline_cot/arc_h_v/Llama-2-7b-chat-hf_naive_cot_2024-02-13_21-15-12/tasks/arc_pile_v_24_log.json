The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 1, 8, 0], [4, 0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 8, 3], [0, 1, 8, 3]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 3], [4, 1, 8, 3], [4, 1, 8, 3]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 8, 0, 3, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 3, 7], [0, 8, 0, 3, 7]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 7], [2, 6, 0, 0, 7], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 7], [2, 6, 0, 0, 7]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 9, 4, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the description of the transformation pattern, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids. Then, I will transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nFor the test input grid, I will describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes. I will also describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n{\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes\",\n\"object_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"[Copy the test case input grid from the task]\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"Transform the grid or objects according to the given transformation pattern\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"Create the resulting output grid as NumPy array.\"\n}\n\nFor the test input grid, the changes between the input and output pixels can be observed as follows:\n\n* In the first row, the second column has changed from 0 to 9, indicating that all pixels in this column have been replaced by the color 9.\n* In the third row, the second column has changed from 0 to 5, indicating that all pixels in this column have been replaced by the color 5.\n* In the fourth row, the second column has changed from 0 to 8, indicating that all pixels in this column have been replaced by the color 8.\n* In the fifth row, the second column has changed from 0 to 7, indicating that all pixels in this column have been replaced by the color 7.\n\nFor the test input grid, the changes between the input and output objects can be observed as follows:\n\n* Object 1 has changed from having a size of 3 to having a size of 7, indicating that it has grown in size.\n* Object 2 has changed from having a size of 1 to having a size of 5, indicating that it has shrunk in size.\n* Object 3 has changed from having a size of 4 to having a size of 8, indicating that it has grown in size.\n\nBased on these observations, the required transformation actions can be described as follows:\n\n1. For each pixel in the input grid, replace the color value with the corresponding value from the transformation pattern.\n2. For each object in the input grid, apply the appropriate scaling factor to its size based on the transformation pattern.\n3. For each object in the input grid, rotate it counterclockwise by an angle equal to the modulo of its x-coordinate and the width of the grid.\n4. For each object in the input grid, translate it by an amount equal to the sum of its y-coordinate and the width of the grid.\n\nBy applying these transformation actions, the input grid can be transformed into the corresponding output grid."
