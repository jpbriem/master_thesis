The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the requirements you've described, we can infer that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid while preserving certain properties.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can employ various techniques such as geometric transformations, color manipulation, and pattern recognition. Here's a high-level approach to tackle this challenge:\n\n1. **Geometric transformations**: Apply transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the input grid to ensure that the output grid has the same overall structure as the input grid. These transformations will help maintain the spatial relationships between neighboring pixels.\n2. **Color manipulation**: Modify the color values of each pixel in the input grid according to a set of rules. For instance, you could assign a new color to pixels based on their original color value or the distance between them. This step will allow you to create distinct patterns in the output grid.\n3. **Pattern recognition**: Identify recurring patterns in the input grid, such as lines, curves, or shapes. By recognizing these patterns, you can apply appropriate transformations to preserve them in the output grid.\n4. **Object detection**: Detect small clusters of connected pixels in the input grid that represent individual objects. You can use algorithms like the Hough transform or the Canny edge detector to identify edges and then group pixels into objects based on their connectivity.\n5. **Shape upscaling or downscaling**: If necessary, scale up or down the shapes in the output grid to match the input grid. This step ensures that the output grid has the correct resolution as the input grid.\n6. **Copying, regarding the input grid**: Create a copy of the input grid and perform operations on it. This step allows you to manipulate the input grid and 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0, [0, [0, [0, [0, [0, [0, [0, [0, [0, [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, and  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \u0409, \u040b, and,0, andgt, \ncolor, 0, \ng, \nged, \u042a, kwietyn, sierp, kwietyg, nobody, hopefully, nobody, \u00abarray, 0-ordnet, everybody,0x shape, Begriffe shape shape shape,ordnet,ordnet,\u0435\u0433\u043e,0,0, nobody shape shape shape, nobody, Hinweis shape, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody,0,\nwell,0,0,0,ge,ges,grth, [shape, shape, [in, [ordnung, Bedeut,\n [zeich, Unterscheidung, Einzeln, [connect,us, [sub,\n\n [ordnet,\n\n\n\n\n pa\u017adzier shape shape, nobody,ordnet shape,2,\nordnet,ordnet, [[distribution,{\\\u00e9tat,\nbackground,\n [2,2,2,2, [site,2,2,2,2,2,2, [2,}} [[[[[[[[[[[[ [[ [[[ [co [ [[ [ [[ [factor, [to [work [br [sup [by [factor,\n [percent [eth [pro [process,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [ [[ Hinweis Hinweis [ger [gar [\n\n\n\n\n [ground [tasks\n([ [[\" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the the [the [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [the [the [the the [mov the [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [value [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [[ [[ [ [logic [ [god [file [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [the [the [the [dep the [the the the the [re the [g [re [the [gr [g [gr [g [gr [ge [gr the [gr the [blue the [system the [the [in [in [array [ [factor [imp [name [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [[ [[ [[array [[array [[ [con [fi [graph [the [the [the the [the [the [the [the [the [the [the [the [fe [cases [array [array [the [the [the [the [the [the [the [the [the the the the the the [the [from the [array [array [array [array [array [prec [for [jes [prob [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [array [related [array [gr [array [array [[\\['[array [array [}[[array [[] [array [products [ [ [ [in [in [in [[[[[[array [front [array [array [array [array [array [gre [with [green [[[[[[[[[[[[ [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ [[ [[[ [[ [[ [[ [[[[[[[[[[[[ [[ [[[ [[ [[[[[[[[[\u0409 [[[[[[ [[ [stat [array [ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[[[[[ [[ [[ [[ [[\n\n[\n[\n[ [[ [[[[[[[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ [ [\n\n\n[ [ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[[[[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [you [[[ [[ [ [ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[ [[[ [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[['[['[[[[[[[[ [[ [[ [[ [\n [\n\n\n"
