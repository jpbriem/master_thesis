The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 2, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 2, 1]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 1, 5, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.\n\nBased on the given information, it seems that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while applying certain rules and constraints. The input and output grids have values ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents a specific pixel color. The transformation can involve changing the entire grid or individual objects within the grid.\n\nFrom the examples provided, we can see that the transformation pattern involves copying and moving objects around, while also changing their colors and sizes. For instance, in Example_1, the top-left object is copied and moved to the bottom-right corner, while its color is changed to blue. In Example_2, no objects are moved or copied, but their colors are changed randomly. In Example_3, an additional object is added to the grid, and its color is changed to green.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will need to understand the rules and constraints involved in the transformation. Based on the given information, here are some possible steps that could be involved in the transformation process:\n\n1. Identify the objects in the input grid: Based on the given examples, objects are defined as groups of adjacent pixels of the same color. In the input grid, there may be multiple objects, each with its own set of adjacent pixels.\n2. Determine the transformation pattern: From the examples provided, it appears that the transformation pattern involves copying and moving objects around, while also changing their colors and sizes. However, there may be other transformation patterns involved depending on the specific input and output grids.\n3. Apply the transformation pattern to the input grid: Using the identified objects and the determined transformation pattern, apply the transformation to the input grid. This may involve copying and moving objects, changing their colors and sizes, and possibly adding new objects to the grid.\n4. Output the transformed grid: Once the transformation has been applied, output the resulting grid as a JSON object.\n\nHere is an example of how the transformation could be applied to the input grid:\n```json\n{\n  \"example_1_description\": {\n    \"pixel_changes\": \"copied and moved objects, changed colors\",\n    \"object_changes\": \"top-left object copied and moved to bottom-right corner, color changed to blue\"\n  },\n  \"example_2_description\": {},\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"copy and move objects, change colors and sizes\",\n  \"instructions\": \"identify objects in input grid, determine transformation pattern, apply transformation pattern to input grid\",\n  \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]\",\n  \"test_case_grid_view\": \"[[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\",\n  \"test_case_object_view\": \"objects: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3]], touched objects: none\",\n  \"test_case_transformation\": \"copy top-left object and move to bottom-right corner, change color to blue\",\n  \"test_case_output\": \"[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [0, 6, 5, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```\nNote that this is just one possible way to apply the transformation, and there may be other valid ways to achieve the desired result."
