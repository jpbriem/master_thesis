[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 6, 5, 7, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 5], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 3, 0, 5], [0, 3, 2, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 5], [4, 3, 0, 5], [4, 3, 2, 5]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5], [9, 6, 0, 0, 2, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 7, 2], [9, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 6, 4, 0, 0], [0, 6, 4, 7, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I understand that you want me to infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then transform the input grid into its corresponding output grid. Here's my answer:

Input Grid: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 7, 2], [9, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 6, 4, 0, 0], [0, 6, 4, 7, 2]]

Output Grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 2], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 6, 4, 0, 0], [0, 6, 4, 7, 2]]

Explanation:

* The input grid has a total of 5 objects, each consisting of a sequence of pixels with the same color.
* Each object is surrounded by a border of pixels of the same color.
* The objects are arranged in a rectangular shape, with some objects overlapping.
* The distance between each pair of adjacent objects is constant.
* The color distribution of the input grid is uniform, with each color occurring once.

Based on these observations, I will perform the following transformation steps:

Step 1: Eliminate noise pixels.

* Identify pixels with a value of 0 as noise pixels.
* Replace these pixels with a value of 0.

Step 2: Group pixels by color.

* Divide the grid into regions based on the color of each pixel.
* For each region, count the number of pixels with the same color.
* If the number of pixels is greater than or equal to 3, consider it a single object.
* Otherwise, consider it a noise pixel.

Step 3: Detect and remove redundant objects.

* Check if two adjacent objects have the same color.
* If they do, merge them into a single object.

Step 4: Scale and rotate objects.

* Apply a scaling factor to each object based on its size.
* Rotate each object by a random angle between 0 and 360 degrees.

Step 5: Upscale or downscale the grid.

* If the grid has more than 5 objects, randomly select an object and replace it with a copy of itself scaled up or down by a factor of 2.

Step 6: Refine the grid boundaries.

* Check if any object touches the boundary of the grid.
* If it does, move the object slightly away from the boundary.

After applying these transformation steps, the resulting output grid will be:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 2], [0, 6, 0, 7, 0], [0, 6, 4, 0, 0], [0, 6, 4, 7, 2]]

Note that the exact transformation may vary depending on the specific input grid provided.
