The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 8, 0]]\noutput: [[7, 7, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given examples and instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\n\nInput Grid:\n```markdown\n[[0, 7, 0, 7, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 9, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 0, 4, 0]]\n```\nOutput Grid:\n```markdown\n[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 9, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nExplanation of the Transformation:\n\nThe transformation involves applying geometric and topological operations to the input grid, such as connecting points, orthogonal projections, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, and upscaling or downscaling. These operations result in changing the shape and color distribution of the grid.\n\n1. Connecting Points: Connect the top-left corner of each pixel to its horizontal and vertical neighbors. This creates lines and rectangles in the grid.\n2. Orthogonal Projections: Project each pixel onto the xy-plane and calculate the distance from the origin. This results in a new set of pixels with different colors based on their distances.\n3. Symmetries: Apply line symmetries to the grid by reflecting it across the y-axis or x-axis. This creates new shapes and patterns in the grid.\n4. Mirroring: Reflect the grid horizontally or vertically to create new shapes and patterns.\n5. Rotations: Rotate the grid clockwise or counterclockwise to change its orientation and shape.\n6. Translations: Move the grid by a certain amount in the x or y direction to shift its position.\n7. Upscaling or Downscaling: Increase or decrease the resolution of the grid by duplicating or deleting pixels.\n\nBased on these operations, the input grid is transformed into the output grid, where the colors and shapes have changed due to the applied transformations.\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Copy the test input grid from the task.\n* Describe the changes between the input and output pixels regarding pattern changes.\n* Describe the changes between the input and output objects regarding color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n* Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.\n* Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array."
