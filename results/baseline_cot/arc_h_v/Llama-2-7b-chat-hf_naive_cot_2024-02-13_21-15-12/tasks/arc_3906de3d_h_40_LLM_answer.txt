[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I will provide you with the required information.

'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'Some pixels changed color from 0 to 8', 'object_changes': 'Object 1 grew by 2 pixels horizontally and vertically','shape_upscaling': 'The overall shape of the grid was upscaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions'}

'example_2_description': {'Ellipsis'}

'overall_pattern': 'The input and output grids exhibit similar patterns, with some differences in color distribution and object movements. The objects in the output grid are larger than their counterparts in the input grid, indicating a scaling effect.'

'instructions': 'Transform the input grid into the output grid by applying the following steps:

1. For each pixel in the input grid, check if it has a neighbor with a color value of 8. If it does, set the color of the current pixel to 8. Otherwise, keep the original color.
2. For each object in the input grid, find its center coordinates using the minimum distance algorithm. Then, scale the object by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. Move the scaled object to its new position while maintaining its original orientation.
3. Check if there are any remaining pixels that do not belong to any object. If so, add a new object to the grid with a random color value. Place the new object at a random location within the grid boundaries.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no more modifications are needed.

'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task'

'test_case_grid_view': 'Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns. The grid consists of alternating dark and light squares, with some slight variations in color distribution. There are also small, irregularly shaped objects scattered throughout the grid.'

'test_case_object_view': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number. Object 1 is a large, irregularly shaped object with a dark color, located in the top left corner of the grid. Object 2 is a smaller, circular object with a light color, located near the center of the grid. Object 3 is a long, thin object with a dark color, located towards the bottom of the grid.'

'test_case_transformation': 'Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed. The grid should be resized by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, while preserving the aspect ratio. The objects should be scaled by a factor of 2 in both dimensions as well, but their centers should be shifted randomly to create new positions within the grid boundaries.'

'test_case_output': 'Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.'

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
