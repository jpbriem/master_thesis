[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Based on the provided examples and the given tasks, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids as follows:

Input Grid:
The input grid consists of 2D pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. Each pixel has a unique color assigned to it, and there are no overlapping pixels. The grid dimensions are (2, 5).

Output Grid:
The output grid also consists of 2D pixels with values ranging from 1 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. However, the output grid has undergone a transformation that involves scaling, rotation, and shifting. Specifically, each output pixel is created by taking the average value of the surrounding 3x3 neighborhood of input pixels, where the weights for each neighbor are determined by their distance from the center pixel. The resulting output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid but may exhibit non-uniform spacing due to the transformation.

Task Description:
Given an input grid and a transformation function, transform the input grid into its corresponding output grid while preserving the overall pattern and color distribution. The transformation function should take into account geometric and topological properties such as lines, rectangles, symmetry, and touching objects.

Instructions:

* Describe the required transformation actions in detail, step by step.
* Provide the test cases for the given examples, including the input and output grids, and explain the reasoning behind each transformation.
* Explain how the grid or objects should be transformed, including any conditions or constraints.
* Discuss the concept of objects and how they are affected by the transformation.
* Provide a description of the input-output relationship, highlighting any patterns or features that are preserved or changed during the transformation process.

Example 1:
In this example, the input grid is transformed by applying a series of rotations, scalings, and shifts to create the output grid. The transformation is designed to preserve the overall pattern and color distribution of the input grid while introducing new patterns and structures through the transformation.

Example 2:
In this example, the input grid is transformed by applying a combination of line segments, rectangle filling, and symmetry operations to create the output grid. The transformation is designed to create a more complex and intricate pattern compared to the first example, while still preserving the overall structure and color distribution of the input grid.

Overall Pattern:
The overall pattern in both examples is the preservation of the overall structure and color distribution of the input grid while introducing new patterns and structures through the transformation. The transformation functions used in these examples are designed to capture the geometric and topological properties of the input grid, such as lines, rectangles, symmetry, and touching objects, and to generate new patterns and structures that are consistent with these properties.
