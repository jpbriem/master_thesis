You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the instructions you've provided, we can infer that the task requires us to transform an input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid while applying certain geometric and topological transformations.

To begin with, let's analyze the examples you've provided. In each example, the input and output grids consist of pixels represented by numbers from 0 to 9, where 0 represents the background color. The transformations involve copying, moving, and scaling objects (based on their color) within the grid. These operations follow specific rules, such as connecting adjacent pixels of the same color, maintaining the overall symmetry of the grid, and respecting the boundaries of the grid.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following steps to solve the task:

1. Preprocessing:
a. Convert the input grid to a binary representation, where pixels with value 0 represent the background color, and pixels with non-zero values represent objects.
b. Threshold the binary image to separate the objects from the background.
c. Perform morphological operations (e.g., erosion, dilation) to refine the object boundaries and remove noise.
2. Transformation planning:
a. Identify the objects in the input grid based on their color and spatial properties.
b. Determine the desired transformations for each object, such as translation, rotation, scaling, or flipping.
c. Plan the sequence of transformations to apply to each object while ensuring that the overall symmetry and boundary conditions are maintained.
3. Transformation application:
a. Apply the planned transformations to each object in the input grid.
b. Update the positions, sizes, and colors of the objects accordingly.
4. Output generation:
a. Generate the final output grid by converting the transformed objects back to their original pixel values.
b. Add any additional features or patterns to the output grid, if required.

To validate our approach, we can create a set of test cases based on the examples you've provided. For each test case, we can apply the proposed steps to transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid and evaluate the results against the expected output.

Please provide us with the next input grid, and we will start implementing the solution.
