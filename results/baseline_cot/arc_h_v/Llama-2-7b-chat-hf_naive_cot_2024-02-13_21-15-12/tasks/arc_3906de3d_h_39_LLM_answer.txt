prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I will provide you with the required information.

'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes':'some pixels changed color', 'object_changes': 'objects were created or destroyed' },
'example_2_description': {'Ellipsis'},
'overall_pattern': 'the input and output grids share the same underlying transformation pattern, where each object in the input grid is transformed into an equivalent object in the output grid, while maintaining their original color and position',
'instructions': 'transform the input grid according to the given pattern, using the provided arithmetical operations to modify the objects and create new ones if necessary',
'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task',
'test_case_grid_view': 'the input grid consists of 9x9=81 pixels, with 0 representing the background color and 1-8 representing different object colors. Each object has a unique color and size, and some objects touch or overlap others.',
'test_case_object_view':'regarding the first example, there are 6 distinct objects in the input grid, each with a unique color and size. Some objects touch or overlap others, and some objects are larger than others.',
'test_case_transformation': 'apply the given transformation pattern to the input grid, creating the corresponding output grid. Use the provided arithmetical operations to modify the objects and create new ones if necessary.',
'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.'

For the given input grid, the transformation pattern would involve applying a series of geometric and topological transformations to each object in the grid, such as rotation, scaling, and shifting. These transformations would result in the creation of new objects and the modification of existing ones, while maintaining their original color and position. The overall pattern would be that the input and output grids share the same underlying transformation pattern, where each object in the input grid is transformed into an equivalent object in the output grid, while maintaining their original color and position.
