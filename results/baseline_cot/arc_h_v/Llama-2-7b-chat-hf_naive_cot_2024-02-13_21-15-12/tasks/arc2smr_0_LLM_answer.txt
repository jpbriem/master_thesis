[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Based on the provided examples and the given tasks, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids as follows:

Input Grid:

* Each row represents an object, where each column corresponds to a pixel value.
* The pixel values range from 1 to 9, representing different colors and shades.
* There are no noise pixels.

Output Grid:

* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
* For each pixel in the input grid, there exists a corresponding pixel in the output grid with the same color and shade.
* The output grid may contain additional features such as lines, rectangles, or other shapes that do not exist in the input grid.

In terms of the logical pattern, I can identify the following concepts:

* Geometry and topology:
	+ Lines: Connecting pixels of the same color or shade.
	+ Rectangles: Enclosing multiple connected pixels of the same color or shade.
	+ Symmetry: Reflecting objects or shapes around a central axis.
	+ Mirroring: Flipping objects or shapes over a central axis.
	+ Rotation: Turning objects or shapes around a central axis.
	+ Translation: Moving objects or shapes along a straight line or distance.
* Objects:
	+ Pixels are grouped into objects based on their spatial proximity and similarity in color or shade.
	+ Objects may touch or overlap each other.
	+ Objects may have varying sizes and shapes.
* Arithmetic operations:
	+ Counting: Determining the total number of pixels or objects in the grid.
	+ Sorting: Organizing pixels or objects based on their color or shade.

Based on these concepts, I can provide the following descriptions for the input and output grids:

Input Grid Description:

* Pixels are arranged in rows and columns, with each pixel having a unique color or shade value ranging from 1 to 9.
* The grid contains various shapes and objects, including lines, rectangles, and other geometric forms.
* Some pixels form clusters or groups based on their color or shade, while others are isolated or scattered throughout the grid.
* There are no noise pixels or random patterns in the input grid.

Output Grid Description:

* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with each pixel corresponding to a specific location in the input grid.
* The output grid contains enhanced versions of the input grid's shapes and objects, including more detailed and refined lines, rectangles, and other geometric forms.
* Additional features may appear in the output grid, such as new shapes or objects created through mathematical operations like rotation, translation, or scaling.
* The output grid maintains the overall structure and organization of the input grid but adds new details and features.

To transform the input grid into the output grid, I would apply the following steps:

Step 1: Identify and group pixels based on their color or shade values.
Step 2: Analyze the relationships between pixels and objects in the input grid.
Step 3: Apply mathematical operations to enhance and refine the shapes and objects in the input grid.
Step 4: Translate the modified grid into the output grid, ensuring accurate correspondence between pixels and locations.

By following these steps, I can create the desired output grid based on the given input grid, incorporating the specified transformations and arithmetical operations.
