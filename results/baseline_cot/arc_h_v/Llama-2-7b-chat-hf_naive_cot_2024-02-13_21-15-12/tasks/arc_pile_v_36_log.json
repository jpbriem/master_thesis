The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 6, 3, 9]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 8, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0], [7, 5, 8, 4]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given examples and instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then transform the test input grid into its corresponding output grid.\n\nInput Grid:\n[[1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]\n\nOutput Grid:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The transformation pattern involves copying and shifting objects horizontally and vertically while maintainingly their color and size.\n* In this case, there are four objects in the input grid, each consisting of three pixels with the same color. These objects are shifted horizontally and vertically to create the output grid.\n* The zero-indexing for the coordinates refers to the top-left corner of each pixel, where (0,0) corresponds to the upper-left corner of the input grid.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Copy the input grid and shift it horizontally and vertically to create the output grid.\n2. For each object in the input grid, copy it horizontally and vertically to create an identical object in the output grid.\n3. Adjust the position of each object in the output grid to match its corresponding position in the input grid.\n4. Maintain the color and size of each object in the output grid.\n\nTest Case Input Grid View:\n\nThe input grid consists of 16 pixels arranged in a 4x4 grid. The pixels are represented by numbers from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents the darkest color.\n\nPixels:\n\nTop Row:\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n[1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nMiddle Row:\n[1, 0, 4, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 7, 4, 6]\n[0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nBottom Row:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 4, 0]\n[0, 7, 4, 6]\n[0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nTest Case Output Grid View:\n\nThe output grid also consists of 16 pixels arranged in a 4x4 grid. The pixels are represented by numbers from 1 to 9, where 1 represents the background color and 9 represents the darkest color.\n\nPixels:\n\nTop Row:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 4, 0]\n[0, 7, 4, 6]\n[0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nMiddle Row:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 4, 0]\n[0, 7, 4, 6]\n[0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nBottom Row:\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[1, 0, 4, 0]\n[0, 7, 4, 6]\n[0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nTest Case Transformation:\n\nThe transformation involves copying the input grid and shifting it horizontally and vertically to create the output grid. Each object in the input grid is copied horizontally and vertically to create an identical object in the output grid. The position of each object in the output grid is adjusted to match its corresponding position in the input grid.\n\nTest Case Output:\n\nThe output grid is created by applying the transformation described above to the input grid. The resulting output grid has the same structure and color distribution as the input grid, but with some slight variations due to the shifting and copying of objects."
