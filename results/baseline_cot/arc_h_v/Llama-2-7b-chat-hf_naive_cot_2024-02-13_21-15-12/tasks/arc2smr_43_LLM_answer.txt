[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the requirements you've outlined, we can infer that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid while preserving certain properties.

To solve this problem, we can employ various techniques such as geometric transformations, color manipulation, and pattern recognition. Here's a high-level approach to tackle this problem:

1. **Geometric transformations**: Since the input and output grids have values from 1 to 9, we can apply basic geometric transformations like rotation, scaling, translation, and reflection. These operations will help us align the input grid with the desired output pattern.
2. **Color manipulation**: We need to preserve the color distribution in the output grid. Therefore, we can use techniques like bitwise operations, histogram equalization, or color jittering to maintain the color balance in the output grid.
3. **Pattern recognition**: The input grid may contain various patterns, such as lines, squares, or other shapes. We need to identify these patterns in the output grid and transform them accordingly.
4. **Copying and moving objects**: We need to copy and move objects in the output grid according to their positions in the input grid. This operation will ensure that the output grid has the correct position and size.
5. **Sorting**: We need to sort the input grid based on the size, 0, and 1, 0]. This operation will ensure that the output grid is sorted correctly aligned with the input grid.
6. **Transforming upscaling or stretching**: If necessary, we can apply scaling operations to transform the input grid. This will ensure that the output grid is correctly scaled up or downscaled.] 

Based on the above steps, we can create a detailed description of the input and output grid view, regarding the test case_1_1_2:
