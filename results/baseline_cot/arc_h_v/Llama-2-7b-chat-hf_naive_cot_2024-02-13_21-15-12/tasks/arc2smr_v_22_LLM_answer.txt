[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! Based on the provided examples and instructions, I will now infer the relationship between the input and output grids and transform the test input grid accordingly.

Input Grid:
----------------

The input grid has a size of (2, 8). Each pixel value ranges from 0 to 9, representing different colors and shades. The grid contains several objects, including lines, rectangles, and other shapes.

Output Grid:
--------------

Based on the given examples, I will transform the input grid into an output grid with the same dimensions (2, 8). The output grid will contain the following features:

1. **Color**: Each pixel value will represent the average color of the surrounding pixels within a fixed radius (e.g., 1 pixel).
2. **Shapes**: The grid will contain various shapes, such as lines, rectangles, and other geometric figures, based on the connectivity of neighboring pixels. These shapes may overlap or touch each other.
3. **Mosaic**: The grid will display a mosaic pattern created by alternating dark and light areas, where the darkness corresponds to the density of the shapes.
4. **Noise**: Random noise will be added to some pixels to simulate errors or imperfections in the image.

Transformations:
-------------------

To achieve these outputs, I will apply the following transformations to the input grid:

1. **Pixel values**: For each pixel, I will calculate the average color of the surrounding pixels within a fixed radius (e.g., 1 pixel). This will result in a new pixel value that represents the overall color of the surrounding area.
2. **Shape creation**: For each object in the input grid, I will create a new shape based on the connectivity of neighboring pixels. The shape's properties (size, orientation, etc.) will depend on the object's original properties and the surrounding environment.
3. **Touching objects**: When two or more objects touch each other, their boundaries will blend smoothly to form a continuous shape.
4. **Noise injection**: Random noise will be added to some pixels to simulate errors or imperfections in the image.

Description of the Transformations:
------------------------------------

1. Pixel values:
For each pixel (x, y) in the input grid, we calculate the average color of the surrounding pixels within a fixed radius (r). Specifically, we take the mean of the pixel values of all pixels within a circle centered at (x, y) and radius r. We denote this average color as C(x, y, r).
2. Shape creation:
Given an object O in the input grid, we create a new shape S based on the connectivity of neighboring pixels around O. The shape's properties (size, orientation, etc.) depend on the object's original properties and the surrounding environment.
3. Touching objects:
When two or more objects O1, O2 intersect, we blend their boundaries smoothly to form a continuous shape. Specifically, we linearly interpolate the color values of the adjacent pixels along the shared boundary to create a seamless transition between the shapes.
4. Noise injection:
We add random noise N to some pixels in the input grid according to a known probability distribution. The noise values range from -1 to 1, and they are independent of the original pixel values.

Expected Output:
-------------------------

After applying the above transformations, the expected output grid will look like this:
