The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 6, 3, 0, 2]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 0, 3]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6, 9, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the test input grid accordingly.\n\nThe relation between the input and output grids seems to be based on geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translation, as well as arithmetical operations involving objects or shapes. Specifically, the transformation appears to involve upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions, copying, repeating, and touching objects.\n\nBased on the given examples, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying a series of operations to each object in the input grid, resulting in a corresponding object in the output grid. These operations may include changing the color, size, coordinates, shape, and number of objects. Additionally, noise pixels may be introduced in the output grid.\n\nTo transform the test input grid, I will apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Upscale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n\nInput: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[16, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 4, 14, 0, 0], [16, 0, 14, 0, 18], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nStep 2: Rotate the output grid by 90 degrees clockwise around the origin.\n\nInput: [[16, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 4, 14, 0, 0], [16, 0, 14, 0, 18], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[0, 4, 14, 2, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 14, 0, 18], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nStep 3: Translate the output grid by 5 units in the x-direction.\n\nInput: [[0, 4, 14, 2, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 14, 0, 18], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[5, 4, 19, 2, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 4, 14, 0, 18], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nStep 4: Repeat the process of upscaling, rotating, and translating the output grid by 3 times.\n\nInput: [[5, 4, 19, 2, 0], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 4, 14, 0, 18], [16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[10, 8, 36, 4, 0], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 21, 0, 18], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nStep 5: Apply noise pixels to the output grid by randomly setting some of the pixels to random values between 0 and 9.\n\nInput: [[10, 8, 36, 4, 0], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 21, 0, 18], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[10, 8, 36, 4, 0], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 21, 0, 18], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 0, 0, 0], [random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9]]\n\nTherefore, the transformed output grid is:\n\nInput: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[10, 8, 36, 4, 0], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 21, 0, 18], [32, 0, 0, 0, 0], [10, 8, 0, 0, 0], [random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9, random value between 0 and 9]]"
