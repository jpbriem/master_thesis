The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 9, 4, 8, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 4, 8, 0], [0, 0, 9, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 9, 4, 8, 6]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 7, 6], [3, 0, 7, 6], [0, 0, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 6], [0, 0, 7, 6], [3, 0, 7, 6]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[1, 9, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 5, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 5, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [1, 0, 5, 0, 3], [1, 9, 5, 0, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [4, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 8, 0, 2, 0], [4, 8, 3, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 2, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the description of the transformation pattern, I believe the task is to perform a series of geometric transformations on the input grid, such as scaling, rotation, translation, and possibly some more complex operations like perspective projection or affine transformation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\n1. Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, so that each pixel becomes twice as large. This will result in an output grid with twice the number of pixels as the input grid.\n2. Rotate the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise around the origin. This will cause the grid to become oriented vertically instead of horizontally.\n3. Translate the input grid by 2 units in the x direction and 3 units in the y direction. This will move the grid 2 units to the right and 3 units up from its original position.\n4. Apply a perspective projection to the input grid, where the distance from the viewer is proportional to the distance on the screen. This will cause the grid to appear smaller towards the edges and larger in the center.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 multiple times, with increasing factors for each operation. For example, after scaling by a factor of 2, rotate by 90 degrees, translate by 4 units in the x direction and 6 units in the y direction, and then apply another perspective projection with a factor of 2, the resulting grid will have undergone significant changes in terms of size, orientation, and shape.\n\nBased on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation pattern involves applying a combination of these operations in a specific sequence to produce the desired output grid. However, without additional information or constraints, it's difficult to determine the exact sequence of operations needed to achieve the desired transformation.\n\nTherefore, I will provide two possible solutions for the given input grid, each representing a different sequence of transformations:\n\nSolution 1:\n\n1. Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n2. Rotate the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise around the origin.\n3. Translate the input grid by 2 units in the x direction and 3 units in the y direction.\n4. Apply a perspective projection to the input grid with a factor of 2.\n\nSolution 2:\n\n1. Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n2. Rotate the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise around the origin.\n3. Translate the input grid by 4 units in the x direction and 6 units in the y direction.\n4. Apply a perspective projection to the input grid with a factor of 2.\n\nPlease let me know which solution you prefer, or if you have any further instructions or constraints."
