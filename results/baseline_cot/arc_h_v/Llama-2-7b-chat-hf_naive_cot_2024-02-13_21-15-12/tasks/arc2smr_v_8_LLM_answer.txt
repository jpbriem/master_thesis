[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the requirements you've described, we can infer that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid while preserving certain properties.

To solve this problem, we can employ various techniques such as geometric transformations, color manipulation, and pattern recognition. Here's a high-level approach to tackle this challenge:

1. **Geometric transformations**: Since the input and output grids have values from 0 to 9, we can apply basic geometric transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to the input grid. These operations will likely affect the output grid as well, so we need to keep track of those transformations and adjust the output accordingly.
2. **Color manipulation**: We can manipulate the colors in the input grid to produce the desired output. For instance, if the input grid has a specific color distribution, we can replicate or invert those colors in the output grid. Additionally, we may need to adjust the brightness, contrast, or saturation of the colors to ensure consistency across the output grid.
3. **Pattern recognition**: The input grid may contain distinct patterns, such as lines, curves, or shapes. By recognizing these patterns, we can transform them appropriately in the output grid. For example, if the input grid contains a line segment, we can translate it horizontally or vertically in the output grid to maintain its integrity.
4. **Object detection and transformation**: If the input grid contains multiple objects, we need to identify and transform each object separately. This involves locating the objects in both the input and output grids, then applying the appropriate transformation (e.g., rotation, scaling, or flipping).
5. **Coordinate system**: To ensure consistent results, we must define a coordinate system for both the input and output grids. This includes defining the origin, spacing, and the dimensions of the grid.
6. **Output grid generation**: Once we have transformed the input grid, generate the output grid according to the rules defined in the output grid.
7. **Validation**: Finally, we must validate the transformation using the input and output grids using the specified rules.

Based on the above steps, we can develop a detailed description of the transformation.

Your task is to transform the input and output grids.

Please provide a detailed description of the following in json format as follows:
