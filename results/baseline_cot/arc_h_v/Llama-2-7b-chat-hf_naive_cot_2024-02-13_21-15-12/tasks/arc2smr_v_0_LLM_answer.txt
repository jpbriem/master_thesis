[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Based on the provided examples and the given requirements, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids and provide the necessary transformations.

Input Grid:
----------------

* Dimension: 2
* Number of pixels: 9
* Values: 0-8

Output Grid:
--------------

* Dimension: 2
* Number of pixels: 9
* Values: 0-8

Transformations:
-------------------

### Geometry and Topology

* Line: Preserve
* Rectangle: Preserve
* Connecting Points: Preserve
* Orthogonal Projections: Preserve
* Symmetries: None
* Mirroring: None
* Rotations: None
* Translations: Move each pixel by 1 unit in the x and y directions.

### Objects

* Identify objects based on their color distribution.
* Each object has a unique identifier (ID).
* Objects are represented as polygons in the grid.
* Objects are connected if they share a common edge or corner.
* Objects are separated if they do not touch any other object.

### Arithmetic Operations

* Counting: Perform a simple count operation on the number of non-zero pixels in each row and column.
* Sorting: Sort the pixels in each row and column based on their value.

Instructions:

1. Translate the input grid by 1 unit in both the x and y directions.
2. For each object, calculate its ID based on its color distribution.
3. Update the color values of each pixel based on its new position and object ID.
4. Apply the arithmetic operations to the updated grid.

Description of Pixels Changes:

* For each pixel, update its color value based on its new position and object ID.
* If a pixel is part of an object, update its color value based on the object's ID and color distribution.
* If a pixel is not part of any object, keep its original color value.

Expected Output:
------------------

* The output grid should have the same dimensions and number of pixels as the input grid.
* The output grid should contain the same information as the input grid, including the color values of each pixel.
* The output grid should reflect the transformations applied to the input grid, including the translation and arithmetic operations.

Note: This solution assumes that the input grid is represented as a 2D numpy array, and the transformations are applied element-wise.
