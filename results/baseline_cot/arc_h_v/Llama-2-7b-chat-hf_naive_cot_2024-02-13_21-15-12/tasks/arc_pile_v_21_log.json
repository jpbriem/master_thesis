The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 7, 0, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 4], [6, 5, 0, 0, 4], [6, 5, 7, 9, 4]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 9], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [3, 8, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [3, 8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [3, 8, 1, 7, 5, 9]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 7, 4, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [2, 0, 4, 0, 0], [2, 7, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [2, 7, 4, 0, 1], [2, 7, 4, 0, 1]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[3, 8, 5, 9, 2, 7], [0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 7], [0, 0, 5, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, I understand that the task is to transform a 2D input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid, while applying certain geometric and topological transformations. These transformations include:\n\n* Lines, rectangular shapes, and orthogonal projections\n* Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, and translations\n* Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions\n* Containing or being contained within a perimeter\n* Copying and repeating patterns or mosaics based on section\n\nTo solve this problem, I will need to perform the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the Input Grid\nI will carefully examine the input grid and identify the objects within it. Based on the given examples, objects are defined as adjacent pixels of the same color. I will also note the size, coordinate, and shape of each object.\n\nStep 2: Apply Transformations\nUsing the logical pattern provided, I will apply the necessary transformations to the input grid. This may involve lines, rectangles, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, elastic distortions, containing or being contained within a perimeter, copying, and repeating patterns or mosaics based on sections. I will ensure that these transformations are consistent across the entire grid and that they result in a valid output grid.\n\nStep 3: Describe Output Grid\nOnce the transformations have been applied, I will carefully examine the resulting output grid and describe any changes that occur regarding the input grid. This may include changes in pixel colors, object sizes, coordinates, shapes, and numbers.\n\nStep 4: Provide Instructions\nBased on the given examples and the logical pattern provided, I will provide detailed instructions on how to transform the input grid into the output grid. These instructions will outline the specific transformations to be applied and how they should be performed.\n\nStep 5: Test Case Input-Output Pairs\nI will verify that the proposed solution works correctly for the provided test case input-output pairs. This will involve comparing the output grid generated using the proposed solution with the expected output grid and ensuring that they match.\n\nHere is the requested JSON output for the given input grid:\n```json\n{\n  \"example_1_description\": {\n    \"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes\",\n    \"object_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number\"\n  },\n  \"example_2_description\": {},\n  \"overall_pattern\": \"Describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs\",\n  \"instructions\": \"Describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step\",\n  \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[3, 8, 5, 9, 2, 7]\",\n  \"test_case_grid_view\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns\",\n  \"test_case_object_view\": \"Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number\",\n  \"test_case_transformation\": \"Transform the input grid into the output grid by applying the logical pattern and instructions provided.\",\n  \"test_case_output\": \"[3, 0, 5, 9, 2, 7]\"\n}\n```\nPlease let me know if there are any further clarifications or details needed to complete this task."
