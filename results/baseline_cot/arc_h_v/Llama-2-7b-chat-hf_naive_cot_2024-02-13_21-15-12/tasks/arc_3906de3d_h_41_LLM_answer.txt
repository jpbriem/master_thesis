[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I will provide you with the required information.

'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'Some pixels changed color from 0 to 3', 'object_changes': 'Object 1 grew by 1 pixel in both x and y directions'}

'example_2_description': {'Ellipsis'}

'overall_pattern': 'The input and output grids exhibit similar patterns, with some differences in color distribution and object sizes.'

'instructions': 'Transform the input grid according to the given pattern. For each iteration, perform the following steps:

1. Check if there are any adjacent pixels of the same color as the current pixel. If yes, merge them into a single pixel of their combined color.
2. Check if there are any adjacent pixels of a different color than the current pixel. If yes, split the current pixel into two or more pixels of their respective colors.
3. Check if there are any empty pixels (i.e., pixels with no neighbor). If yes, fill them with the average color of their surrounding neighbors.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no further changes occur.

Note that the above instructions apply to both the entire grid and individual objects. Also, note that the transformation may result in some distortion or stretching of objects, but they should still maintain their overall shape and color distribution.'

'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task'

'test_case_grid_view': 'The input grid consists of 8 rows and 8 columns, with each pixel value ranging from 0 to 9. Some areas of the grid have a distinct pattern of alternating dark and light pixels, while others have a more random arrangement. There are also several larger objects scattered throughout the grid, each with a consistent color scheme.'

'test_case_object_view': 'Regarding the test input, there are three main objects:

Object 1: A large, irregularly shaped area with a bright yellow color. It spans across multiple rows and columns, with some parts overlapping with other objects.

Object 2: A smaller, circular object with a dark blue color. It is located in the top-left corner of the grid.

Object 3: Another small object with a light green color. It is situated in the bottom-right corner of the grid.'

'test_case_transformation': 'Transform the input grid according to the given pattern, preserving the overall shape and color distribution of the objects. However, feel free to adjust the size and position of the objects slightly to improve the overall aesthetic appeal of the transformation.'

'test_case_output': 'Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array, with each pixel value representing the new color distribution after applying the transformation.'
