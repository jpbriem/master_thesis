You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the instructions you've provided, we can infer that the task requires us to transform an input grid of pixels into an equivalent output grid while applying certain geometric and topological transformations.

To begin with, let's analyze the examples you've provided. In Example 1, the input grid consists of 8x8 pixels, and the output grid has the same dimensions but with each pixel value replaced by a new set of values (0, 2, 2, 0, 3). It seems that the transformation involves replacing each pixel value with a new value based on the original pixel color.

In Example 2, the input grid also consists of 8x8 pixels, but this time, the transformation involves copying and pasting parts of the grid while maintaining their original positions and colors. This suggests that the transformation may involve copy-and-paste operations along with some rotation or flipping of the copied regions.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following steps to solve the task:

1. Initialize an empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. Iterate through each row of the input grid, performing the following operations:
a. For each pixel in the current row, apply the appropriate transformation based on its color. This could involve replacing the pixel value with a new value based on the original pixel color, or it could involve copying and pasting a portion of the grid while maintaining its original position and color.
b. Update the corresponding pixel in the output grid with the transformed value.
3. Repeat step 2 for each row of the input grid until all rows have been processed.
4. Repeat the process for each column of the input grid, starting with the top-left corner and moving diagonally rightwards.

By following these steps, we should be able to transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid while applying the desired geometric and topological transformations. Please confirm if this approach makes sense, and we can proceed with implementing the solution.
