The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4], [0, 2, 2, 2]]\noutput: [[5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]]\noutput: [[3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 5, 5, 5, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the test input grid accordingly.\n\nInput Grid: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]\n\nObservations:\n\n* The input grid consists of 6 rows and 5 columns, with each pixel value ranging from 0 to 9.\n* There are no noise pixels in the input grid.\n* The objects in the input grid are defined as contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.\n* The objects in the input grid are touching each other in some cases.\n\nTransformations:\n\n* For each row in the input grid, perform the following operations:\n\t+ If the row contains any non-zero pixels, copy those pixels to the next row.\n\t+ Otherwise, repeat the last non-zero pixel value in the row.\n* For each column in the input grid, perform the following operations:\n\t+ If the column contains any non-zero pixels, copy those pixels to the next column.\n\t+ Otherwise, repeat the last non-zero pixel value in the column.\n* For each object in the input grid, perform the following operations:\n\t+ If the object spans more than one row or column, stretch it horizontally and vertically while maintaining its original color.\n\t+ If an object touches the boundary of the grid, reflect it around the boundary.\n\nOutput Grid: [[9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n* Each pixel value in the output grid is determined by the corresponding pixel value in the input grid, according to the transformations described above.\n* The objects in the output grid are the same as in the input grid, but may have been stretched or reflected due to the transformations.\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Copy the test input grid from the task.\n* Describe the changes between the input and output grids regarding pattern changes.\n* Describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n* Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.\n* Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array."
