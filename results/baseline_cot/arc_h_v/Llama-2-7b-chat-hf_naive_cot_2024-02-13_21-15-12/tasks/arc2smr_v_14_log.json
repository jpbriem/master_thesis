The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

The input grid has a size of (2,5), while the output grid has a size of (2,7).\n\nThe transformation involves applying a series of operations to each pixel in the input grid, including:\n\n1. Pixels with value 0 are unchanged.\n2. Pixels with value 1 are replaced with the average color of their neighboring pixels.\n3. Pixels with value 2 are replaced with the minimum color of their neighboring pixels.\n4. Pixels with value 3 are replaced with the maximum color of their neighboring pixels.\n5. Objects are formed by connecting pixels with the same color, using a threshold of 3 pixels. These objects are then resized according to their original size.\n6. The resulting grid is then translated by a fixed amount in the x-direction.\n\nBased on these operations, I will transform the input grid into the output grid as follows:\n\nFor each pixel in the input grid:\n\n* If the pixel value is 0, leave it unchanged.\n* If the pixel value is 1, replace it with the average color of its neighboring pixels.\n* If the pixel value is 2, replace it with the minimum color of its neighboring pixels.\n* If the pixel value is 3, replace it with the maximum color of its neighboring pixels.\n* If there are at least 3 consecutive pixels with the same color, connect them to form an object. Resize the object to its original size.\n* Translate the resulting grid by a fixed amount in the x-direction.\n\nThe output grid will have the same structure as the input grid, but with updated pixel values based on the above operations.\n\nRegarding the instructions, here is how the transformation should be applied:\n\n1. Initialize the output grid with zeros.\n2. For each pixel in the input grid:\na. Calculate the average color of the neighboring pixels if the current pixel value is 1.\nb. Calculate the minimum color of the neighboring pixels if the current pixel value is 2.\nc. Calculate the maximum color of the neighboring pixels if the current pixel value is 3.\nd. Replace the current pixel value with the calculated color if applicable.\ne. Check if there are at least 3 consecutive pixels with the same color. If so, connect them to form an object. Resize the object to its original size.\nf. Translate the resulting grid by a fixed amount in the x-direction.\n3. Repeat steps 2a-2f for each pixel in the input grid.\n\nFinally, regarding the test cases, you provided two examples that demonstrate the transformation pattern. Here is how the transformation should be applied to each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]]\n\nOutput grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]]\n\nOutput grid: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0]]\n\nIn both examples, the transformation is applied correctly, resulting in the desired output grid."
