The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6]]\noutput: [[3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 3]]\noutput: [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[4, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this problem.\n\nBased on the given input-output pairs and the description of the transformation pattern, I believe the task is to perform a series of geometric transformations on the input grid, such as scaling, rotation, translation, and possibly some more complex operations like perspective projection or affine transformation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how I would approach this problem:\n\n1. Scale the input grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions, so that each pixel value becomes twice as large. This will result in an output grid with twice the number of pixels as the input grid.\n2. Rotate the output grid by 90 degrees clockwise around the origin, so that the grid is now oriented vertically instead of horizontally.\n3. Translate the output grid by 2 pixels in the x direction, so that the origin of the grid is now located at (2, 0).\n4. For each pixel in the output grid, check if it has any neighboring pixels with the same color. If it does, replace the current pixel value with the average of the surrounding pixel values. Otherwise, keep the current pixel value unchanged.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each iteration of the input grid.\n\nHere's the code I would write to implement these transformations:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_grid(grid):\n    # Step 1: Scale the grid\n    scaled_grid = grid * 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Rotate the grid\n    rotated_grid = np.rot90(scaled_grid, k=2)\n    \n    # Step 3: Translate the grid\n    translated_grid = rotated_grid + np.array([2, 0])\n    \n    # Step 4: Apply neighborhood averaging\n    for i in range(len(translated_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(translated_grid[i])):\n            if len(set(translated_grid[i][j])) > 1:\n                translated_grid[i][j] = np.mean(translated_grid[i - 1][j - 1]:translated_grid[i + 1][j + 1])\n    \n    return translated_grid\n\n# Test the function\ninput_grid = np.array([[4, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]])\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\nThis code should produce the expected output for the given input grid. Note that the `np.rot90()` function performs a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation around the origin, while the `np.array()` function creates a NumPy array from the input grid. The `set()` function is used to count the number of unique pixel values in each row and column, and the `len()` function is used to determine the number of rows and columns in the grid. Finally, the `np.mean()` function calculates the average of the surrounding pixel values for each pixel in the output grid."
