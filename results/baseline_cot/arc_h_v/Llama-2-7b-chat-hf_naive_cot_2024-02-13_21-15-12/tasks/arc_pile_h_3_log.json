The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[2, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 5], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 3]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Based on the given input-output pairs and the provided instructions, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the test input grid accordingly.\n\nFor the test input grid `[8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]`, I will describe the changes between the input and output pixels, objects, and overall pattern.\n\nPixels:\nThe output grid has the same pattern as the input grid, but with some changes in the color distribution. In particular, there are more dark pixels (values close to 0) in the output grid compared to the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has 8 dark pixels out of a total of 16 pixels, while the input grid has 4 dark pixels out of a total of 16 pixels.\n\nObjects:\nThere are no new objects created or destroyed in the output grid compared to the input grid. However, some objects have undergone changes in terms of their size, shape, and color distribution. For instance, Object 1 in the input grid has expanded to cover more areas in the output grid, while Object 2 has shrunk significantly. Additionally, some objects in the output grid have acquired a different color distribution compared to the input grid.\n\nOverall Pattern:\nThe overall pattern of the output grid is the same as that of the input grid, but with some modifications in the color distribution and the size and shape of certain objects.\n\nTransformation Actions:\nTo transform the input grid into the output grid, I will apply the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Maintain the original pattern of the input grid.\nStep 2: Increase the darkness of some pixels in the input grid to create a more uniform color distribution in the output grid.\nStep 3: Expand Object 1 in the input grid to cover more areas in the output grid.\nStep 4: Shrink Object 2 in the input grid to a smaller size in the output grid.\nStep 5: Modify the color distribution of some objects in the input grid to match the desired pattern in the output grid.\n\nTest Case Output:\nThe resulting output grid will be:\n```json\n{\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"Increased darkness of some pixels to create a more uniform color distribution\",\n\"object_changes\": \"Expanded Object 1, shrunk Object 2\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"Preserve the original pattern\",\n\"instructions\": \"Maintain the original pattern of the input grid, increase darkness of some pixels, expand Object 1, shrink Object 2\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"[8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"[8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"[Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}]\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"Maintain the original pattern of the input grid, increase darkness of some pixels, expand Object 1, shrink Object 2\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"[8, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]\"\n}\n```"
