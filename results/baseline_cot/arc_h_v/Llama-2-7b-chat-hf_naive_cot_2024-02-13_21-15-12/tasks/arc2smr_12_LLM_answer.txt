[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Great! You've provided us with an interesting problem. Based on the given examples and the requirements you've described, we can infer that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid while preserving certain properties.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the conceptual relationships between the input and output grids. From the examples you've provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Geometry and topology: The input and output grids consist of lines, rectangles, and other geometric shapes. These shapes may be connected or disconnected, and their boundaries may follow specific rules.
2. Color distribution: The pixels in the input and output grids have values from 1 to 9, representing different colors. The colors may be distributed uniformly or non-uniformly across the grid.
3. Object recognition: The input grid contains objects that are defined by connecting pixels of similar colors. These objects may have well-defined boundaries or be more diffuse.
4. Transformation rules: The transformation relates to the entire grid or individual objects. It may involve scaling, rotation, flipping, or other operations.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Preprocessing: Normalize the input grid to ensure that all pixel values fall within a common range, e.g., [0, 255]. This will simplify the subsequent processing steps.
2. Segmentation: Divide the input grid into smaller regions or objects based on the connectivity of neighboring pixels. Each region or object may represent a distinct color or pattern.
3. Feature extraction: Extract features from each region or object, such as color histograms, gradient orientations, or edge maps. These features will help us understand the spatial arrangement and properties of the input grid.
4. Transformation planning: Based on the observed patterns and the desired output, plan the transformation operation(s) that will transform the input grid into the output grid. This may involve applying affine transformations, convolution filters, or other mathematical operations.
5. Transformation implementation: Implement the planned transformation(s) using appropriate algorithms, such as NumPy or scikit-image. Ensure that the transformation is consistent with the observed patterns and produces visually plausible results.
6. Postprocessing: Apply any additional postprocessing techniques to refine the output grid, e.g., noise removal, smoothing, or color adjustments.

By following these steps, we can develop a solution that effectively transforms the input grid into the desired output grid while preserving the relevant properties.
