prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

There are several small objects scattered throughout the grid, including two large objects located at (0,0) and (7,0). These objects have a distinctive shape and color, making them easy to identify.'

'test_case_object_view': 'Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number:

Object 1: Located at (0,0), this object has a size of 3x3 pixels and is colored blue. It has a distinctive shape, with four corners that are slightly rounded.

Object 2: Located at (7,0), this object has a size of 2x2 pixels and is colored red. It has a more irregular shape compared to Object 1, with no clear corners or edges.'

'test_case_transformation': 'Transform the grid or objects according to the given instructions:

For the input grid, apply the following steps:

1. Scale the grid by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
2. Move the grid by 2 pixels in the x-direction and 1 pixel in the y-direction.
3. Set all pixels with a value of 0 to 9.

For the objects, apply the following steps:

1. Calculate the center coordinates of each object using the average position of the surrounding pixels.
2. Scale each object by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
3. Move each object to the corresponding location in the output grid.
4. Set any remaining pixels without an object to 0.

Repeat these steps for each iteration of the input grid.'

'test_case_output': 'Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array:

The output grid consists of 8 rows and 6 columns, with each pixel having a value from 0 to 9. The grid shows a similar pattern to the input grid but with some differences in color distribution and object movements. The objects in the output grid are larger than their counterparts in the input grid, indicating a scaling effect. Some areas of the grid show a higher concentration of darker shades of blue, while others have a predominance of lighter shades. Overall, the output grid maintains the same overall structure and layout as the input grid, but with some noticeable changes in color and object size.'
