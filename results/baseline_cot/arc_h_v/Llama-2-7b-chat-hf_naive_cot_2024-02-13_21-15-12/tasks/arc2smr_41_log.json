The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

Based on the provided examples and the given requirements, I will infer the relation between the input and output grids and then transform the input grid into its corresponding output grid.\n\nInput Grid:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput Grid:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nTransformations:\n\n* Line: There are no lines in the input grid, so no line transformations are applied.\n* Rectangular shape: The input grid has a rectangular shape, so no rectangle transformations are applied.\n* Connecting points: The input grid has connecting points between neighboring pixels of the same color, indicating that there are connections between adjacent pixels. These connections are preserved in the output grid.\n* Orthogonal projections: The input grid does not have any orthogonal projections, so no transformations are applied.\n* Symmetries: The input grid does not have any symmetries, so no transformations are applied.\n* Mirroring: The input grid does not have any mirroring, so no transformations are applied.\n* Rotations: The input grid does not have any rotations, so no transformations are applied.\n* Translations: The input grid does not have any translations, so no transformations are applied.\n* Scaling: The input grid does not have any scaling, so no transformations are applied.\n* Elastic distortions: The input grid does not have any elastic distortions, so no transformations are applied.\n* Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter: The input grid does not contain any objects, so no transformations are applied.\n* Copying, repeating: The input grid does not have any copying or repeating, so no transformations are applied.\n\nBased on these observations, I will transform the input grid into its corresponding output grid without applying any additional transformations.
