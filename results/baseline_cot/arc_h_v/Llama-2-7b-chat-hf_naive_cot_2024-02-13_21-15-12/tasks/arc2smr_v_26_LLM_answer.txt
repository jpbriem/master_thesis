prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Based on the provided examples and the given transformation pattern, I will infer the required transformation rules for the given input grid.

1. Geometry and topology:
a. Line segments: Preserve their length and position.
b. Rectangles: Preserve their area and position.
c. Elongated rectangles: Stretch or shrink them while preserving their aspect ratio.
d. Circles: Preserve their radius and position.
e. Other shapes: Warp them according to a non-uniform scaling or translation.
2. Objects:
a. Identify connected pixels forming objects.
b. Group objects based on their spatial proximity or color similarity.
c. Perform topological operations like merging, splitting, or deleting objects.
d. Apply noise filters to objects based on their color distribution or texture features.
3. Arithmetic operations:
a. Basic arithmetic: Add, subtract, multiply, divide elements or objects.
b. Modular arithmetic: Perform arithmetic operations modulo an integer value.
c. Combinational arithmetic: Apply multiple arithmetic operations sequentially or simultaneously.
4. Instructions:
a. Describe the required transformation actions in detail, step by step.
b. Provide any specific constraints or requirements for each operation.

Based on the given examples, here are some potential transformation rules that could be applied to the input grid:

1. Example 1:
a. Increase the brightness or contrast of certain areas of the grid.
b. Warm up or cool down the color palette of specific regions.
c. Introduce random noise or artifacts to simulate camera exposure errors.
d. Distort the grid's geometry by applying affine transformations like rotation, scaling, shearing, or perspective projection.
2. Example 2:
a. Gradually change the color palette of the grid to create a gradient effect.
b. Introduce noise patterns or textures to simulate the appearance of clouds or mist.
c. Apply artistic styles like pointillustration or watercolor washes.
3. Example 3:
a. Gradually shift the positions of the grid to create a sense of depth.
b. Apply a. Perspective transformation.
c. Introduce noise or artifacts to simulate the appearance of lighting effects.

In general, these instructions can be used to guide the transformation:
a. Describe the required action in detail, step by step.
b. Provide any specific constraints or requirements for each operation.
c. Use appropriate terminology to describe the logic.
