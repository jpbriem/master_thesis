prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that for every pair of horizontally adjacent groups of non-zero pixels (i.e., connected components) with the same value, if there exists another group of non-zero pixels vertically between them, then a new group of pixels is created between them with a value equal to the sum of the two original groups' values plus one. This new group spans the vertical distance between the two original groups and has a width of one. If there are multiple such pairs of horizontal groups in the input grid, they are processed independently.

Here is the detailed description of each part of the output JSON:

* `example_1_description`:
	+ `pixel_changes`: In this example, the input and output grids differ only in the middle row, where some pixels change their value from 6 to 7 when there is an adjacent group of pixels with value 6 above or below them.
	+ `object_changes`: There are no changes in the number or position of objects; however, the color of some objects changes due to the pixel value changes mentioned above. Specifically, objects initially colored with 6 may now contain both 6 and 7 after the transformation.
* `example_2_description`: Same as `example_1_description`.
* `example_3_description`: Same as `example_1_description`.
* `overall_pattern`: As described earlier, the pattern involves creating new groups of pixels between any two horizontally adjacent groups with the same value if there is a third group of pixels vertically between them.
* `instructions`:
	1. Identify all pairs of horizontally adjacent groups of non-zero pixels with the same value.
	2. For each pair identified in step 1, check if there is another group of non-zero pixels vertically between them.
	3. If so, create a new group of pixels between the two original groups with a value equal to the sum of the two original groups' values plus one.
* `test_case_input_copy`: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
* `test_case_grid_view`: Not applicable since the question asks for a description of the test case input grid, which is provided directly in the prompt.
* `test_case_object_view`: Not applicable since the question does not ask for a specific description of the objects in the test case input grid.
* `test_case_transformation`: Apply the instructions mentioned above to identify and process the relevant pairs of horizontally adjacent groups of non-zero pixels.
* `test_case_output`: A numpy array representation of the output grid, e.g., `array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])`
