            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 5], [6, 8, 0, 9, 5], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [6, 8, 0, 9, 5], [6, 8, 0, 9, 5]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 6]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [1, 8, 2, 6]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [7, 0, 3, 5], [7, 2, 0, 5]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here's the solution for the given problem:\n\nThe overall pattern involves moving specific non-background objects towards the bottom right corner while preserving their relative positions. This pattern can be described as follows:\n\n- Identify connected components (objects) of certain colors that do not touch the bottom row or rightmost column.\n- Move these objects towards the bottom right corner by shifting them downwards and to the right until they reach the border.\n\nNow let's analyze each example and then provide the final JSON response.\n\nExample_1:\n\n- Pixel changes: In this example, two groups of connected pixels (colors 5 and 6) move towards the bottom right corner.\n- Object changes: Two objects change position; one moves from the left side to the right side, and another moves from the middle to the bottom right corner.\n\nExample_2:\n\n- Pixel changes: A group of connected pixels (color 1) moves towards the bottom right corner.\n- Object changes: One object changes position, moving from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.\n\nExample_3:\n\n- Pixel changes: Three groups of connected pixels (colors 4, 5, and 6) move towards the bottom right corner.\n- Object changes: Three objects change position; one moves from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, another moves from the center to the bottom right corner, and the last one grows in size while maintaining its original position relatively.\n\nTest case:\n\n- Test case input grid: `[[7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [7, 0, 3, 5], [7, 2, 0, 5]]`\n- Test case grid view: There are three distinct objects - two with color 7 and one with color 3. Color 7 objects occupy the corners, and color 3 is located near the center.\n- Test case object view: Regarding color 7 objects, there are no movements but an increase in size for the lower-right object. For color 3, we observe a shift towards the bottom right corner.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or flood fill algorithm to identify connected components (objects).\n2. Filter out objects touching the bottom row or rightmost column.\n3. Implement a priority queue to store the filtered objects based on their distance from the bottom right corner.\n4. Dequeue objects from the priority queue and shift them downwards and to the right until they reach the border.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the priority queue becomes empty.\n\nJSON response:\n```json\n{\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Move specific non-background objects towards the bottom right corner while preserving their relative positions.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or flood fill algorithm to identify connected components (objects), filter out objects touching the bottom row or rightmost column, implement a priority queue to store the filtered objects based on their distance from the bottom right corner, dequeue objects from the priority queue and shift them downwards and to the right until they reach the border, repeat steps 3 and 4 until the priority queue becomes empty.\",\n    \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[[7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [7, 0, 3, 5], [7, 2, 0, 5]]\",\n    \"test_case_grid_view\": \"There are three distinct objects - two with color 7 and one with color 3.
