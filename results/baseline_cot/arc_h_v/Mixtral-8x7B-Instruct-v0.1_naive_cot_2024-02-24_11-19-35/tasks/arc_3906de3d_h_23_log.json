            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that the function applies a series of transformations to each connected component (or object) of a certain color (in this case, 7 and 8). Here's a description of the observed pattern and instructions to apply the transformation:\n\n`overall_pattern`: For each connected component of a specific color, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from any non-background pixel belonging to the connected component. Label visited pixels using a separate label for each connected component.\n2. Assign new colors to the labeled pixels according to their position relative to the original seed pixel. In the examples provided, the assignment appears to follow this rule:\n   - If the BFS level is even, assign the color 7 if the original color was 8, and vice versa.\n   - Otherwise, keep the original color.\n\n`instructions`: To implement the described transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the connected components in the grid.\n2. When visiting a non-background pixel, check its current color and mark it as visited using another temporary color value.\n3. Keep track of the BFS level or DFS depth during traversal.\n4. Apply the color change rule mentioned above based on the BFS level or DFS depth.\n5. Repeat the process until all connected components have been processed.\n\n`test_case_input_copy`:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n```\n\n`test_case_grid_view`:\nStarting from the leftmost column, there are three horizontal lines of 7s followed by an isolated 8. Next, we see a large block of alternating 7s and 8s. Following this, there is a vertical line of 8s next to a diagonal staircase of 7s and 8s. Finally, there is a group of four horizontally aligned 8s surrounded by 7s.\n\n`test_case_object_view`:\nThere are several distinct objects in the grid:\n\n1. Three horizontal lines of 7s at the beginning of the grid.\n2. An isolated 8 at the end of the third row.\n3. A large block of alternating 7s and 8s occupying most of the middle section of the grid.\n4. A vertical line of 8s in the seventh column.\n5. A diagonal staircase consisting of alternating 7s and 8s.\n6. Four horizontally aligned 8s at the bottom right corner of the grid.\n\n`test_case_transformation`:\nApply the described transformation rules to each connected component of the grid. This will result in changing some of the 7s to 8s and vice versa while preserving the general structure of the objects.\n\n`test_case_output`:\n(Note: Since I cannot create a NumPy array directly here, I am providing the output as a nested list.)\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n```"
