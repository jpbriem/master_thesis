prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that for every pair of horizontally neighboring groups of six non-zero pixels (represented as '6'), a new group of two non-zero pixels (represented as '7') is inserted between them. This applies both when there is an existing group of non-zero pixels separating the two groups of six, and when there isn't. Here is the full description:

*Pixel changes:*
For each pair of horizontally neighboring groups of six non-zero pixels (represented as '6'):
- If there is no group of non-zero pixels between them, insert a group of two non-zero pixels (represented as '7') between them.
- If there is already a group of non-zero pixels between them, check if this middle group has less than six non-zero pixels. If so, replace it with a group of two non-zero pixels (represented as '7'). Otherwise, leave it unchanged.

*Object changes:*
No specific changes occur regarding the objects themselves, but rather regarding their arrangement and composition.

*Instructions:*
1. For each row, iterate through the elements from left to right.
2. When encountering a group of six non-zero pixels (represented as '6'), check if there is another such group to its right within the same row.
3. If yes, proceed; otherwise, move to the next element.
4. Check if there is a group of non-zero pixels between the current and subsequent groups of six.
5. If there is no such group, insert a group of two non-zero pixels (represented as '7') between them.
6. If there is already a group of non-zero pixels between them, check its size.
7. If the group has less than six non-zero pixels, replace it with a group of two non-zero pixels (represented as '7').
8. Repeat steps 2-7 until reaching the end of the row.
9. Move to the next row and repeat steps 2-8.

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

*Test case grid view:*
Initially, there are four horizontal pairs of groups of six non-zero pixels ('6'). Two of these pairs have a group of non-zero pixels between them, while the other two do not.

*Test case object view:*
There are three main objects - two large ones consisting of multiple groups of six non-zero pixels ('6'), and one smaller one composed of a single group of three non-zero pixels.

*Test case transformation:*
Insert a group of two non-zero pixels (represented as '7') between each pair of horizontally neighboring groups of six non-zero pixels ('6'). In cases where there was no group of non-zero pixels between them before, this will create a new object.

*Test case output:*
