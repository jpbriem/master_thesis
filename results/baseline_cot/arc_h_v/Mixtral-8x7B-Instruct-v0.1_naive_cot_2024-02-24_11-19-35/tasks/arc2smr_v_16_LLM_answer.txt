prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that each connected group of threes (3's) in the input grid is replaced with a larger connected group of sevens (7's) in the output grid, where the new group has the same shape as the original but is shifted and expanded. Specifically, each connected group of threes in the input grid is replaced with a group of sevens in the output grid such that:

* For each connected group of threes, there is a corresponding connected group of sevens in the output grid with the same center point.
* Each connected group of sevens in the output grid contains twice as many pixels as the corresponding connected group of threes in the input grid.
* Each connected group of sevens in the output grid is horizontally and vertically translated so that its top left corner is located two pixels to the right and two pixels below the top left corner of the corresponding connected group of threes in the input grid.

To perform this transformation, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all connected groups of threes in the input grid. This can be done using a depth-first search algorithm or a flood fill algorithm.
2. For each connected group of threes, create a corresponding connected group of sevens in the output grid with the same shape but shifted and expanded as described above.
3. Replace the connected group of threes in the input grid with the corresponding connected group of sevens in the output grid.

Here is an example of how this would work for the given test case:

Input grid:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
 [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Step 1: Identify connected groups of threes. In this case, there are two connected groups of threes.

Group 1:
```css
[[3, 0, 3],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 3]]
```
Group 2:
```css
[[0, 0, 3],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 3]]
```
Step 2: Create corresponding connected groups of sevens.

Group 1:
```css
[[7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
```
Group 2:
```css
[[0, 0, 7],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 7]]
```
Step 3: Replace connected groups of threes with corresponding connected groups of sevens.

Output grid:
```css
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Therefore, the output for the test case is:
```json
