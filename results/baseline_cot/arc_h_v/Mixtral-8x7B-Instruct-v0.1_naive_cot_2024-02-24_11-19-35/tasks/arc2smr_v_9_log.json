            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0], [4, 0, 4, 8, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 8, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that each connected group of 4's expands outwards by adding new 4's around the original group. Specifically, for each connected group of 4's, two new layers of 4's are added such that the first layer has twice the radius of the original group and the second layer has three times the radius. Here is the detailed description of the required steps:\n\n1. Identify all connected groups of 4's in the input grid. A connected group of 4's is defined as a set of adjacent non-zero elements surrounded by zeros.\n2. For each connected group of 4's, calculate the radius of the group as the maximum distance from any element in the group to the center of mass of the group.\n3. Add two new layers of 4's around each connected group of 4's. The first layer should have twice the radius of the original group and the second layer should have three times the radius.\n4. Place the new 4's in the empty spaces surrounding the original group, ensuring that they do not overlap with other existing 4's.\n\nHere is the JSON format response:\n```json\n{\n    \"example_1_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"For each connected group of 4's, two new layers of 4's are added such that the first layer has twice the radius of the original group and the second layer has three times the radius.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Each connected group of 4's expands outwards by adding new 4's around the original group.\"\n    },\n    \"example_2_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"For each connected group of 4's, two new layers of 4's are added such that the first layer has twice the radius of the original group and the second layer has three times the radius.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Each connected group of 4's expands outwards by adding new 4's around the original group.\"\n    },\n    \"example_3_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"For each connected group of 4's, two new layers of 4's are added such that the first layer has twice the radius of the original group and the second layer has three times the radius.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Each connected group of 4's expands outwards by adding new 4's around the original group.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"For each connected group of 4's, two new layers of 4's are added such that the first layer has twice the radius of the original group and the second layer has three times the radius.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"Identify all connected groups of 4's in the input grid.
