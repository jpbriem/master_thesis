            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that any non-zero value (representing a pixel color) that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to a group of four or more identical non-zero values will change to become part of that group. Specifically, if there is a group of four or more identical non-zero values in a row or column, then any non-zero value that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to this group will also become part of the group and take on the same value. This process is repeated until no further changes occur.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the required transformation actions:\n\n1. For each non-zero value in the input grid, check whether it is horizontally or vertically adjacent to a group of four or more identical non-zero values. If so, the non-zero value becomes part of the group and takes on the same value as the group.\n2. Repeat step 1 until no further changes occur.\n\nTo apply this transformation to the test case, we start with the given input grid and perform the above steps. Here is the result:\n\nInput grid:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n\nFirst iteration:\n- Change the 9 at position (7,6) to 4 because it is horizontally adjacent to the group of four 4's at positions (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), and (7,11).\n- Change the 9 at position (8,6) to 4 because it is horizontally adjacent to the group of four 4's at positions (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), and (7,11).\n- Change the 9 at position (9,6) to 4 because it is horizontally adjacent to the group of four 4's at positions (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), and (7,11).\n\nSecond iteration:\n- No changes because all non-zero values are either part of a group of four or more identical non-zero values or are not adjacent to such a group.\n\nOutput grid:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\nRegarding the test input, here is the description of the pixels of the entire grid:\n- There are two groups of nine 9's in the top left corner and bottom right corner of the grid.\n- There is a horizontal line of nine 9's in the third row.\n- There is a vertical line of nine 9's in the fourth column.\n- There is a group of three 4's in the bottom right corner of the grid.\n- All other positions in the grid contain zeros.\n\nRegarding the test input, here is the description of the objects:\n- Object 1 consists of the group of nine 9's in the top left corner of the grid. It has a color of 9, a size of 9, and coordinates of (0,0) to (2,2).\n- Object 2 consists of the group of nine 9's in the third row of the grid. It has a color of 9, a size of 9, and coordinates of (3,0) to (11,0).\n- Object 3 consists of the group of nine 9's in the fourth column of the grid. It has a color of 9, a size of 9, and coordinates of (0,3) to (0,11).\n- Object 4 consists of the group of three 4's in the bottom right corner of the grid. It has a color of 4, a size of 3, and coordinates of (7,7) to (9,9).\n\nRegarding the test input, here is the description of the transformation:\n- The 9 at position (7,6) becomes part of Object 4 because it is horizontally adjacent to the group of four 4's at positions (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), and (7,11).\n- The 9 at position (8,6) becomes part of Object 4 because it is horizontally adjacent to the group of four 4's at positions (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), and (7,11).\n- The 9 at position (9,6) becomes part of Object 4 because it is horizontally adjacent to the group of four 4's at positions (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), and (7,11).\n\nTest case output:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 4, 4, 4],\n[9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]"
