            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 7, 7], [8, 0, 8, 0]]\noutput: [[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3]]\noutput: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 7, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [0, 6, 0, 0]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here's the solution for the given problem:\n\nThe overall pattern involves moving the largest colored block (with no zeros) to the rightmost side of the grid while preserving its relative position within that section of the grid. If there are multiple blocks of the same size, then move the bottommost one. This pattern can be observed in all three examples provided.\n\nNow let's break down each part of the requested information:\n\n1. **example\\_1\\_description**:\n   - pixel\\_changes: Pixels in the largest non-zero block remain unchanged except those at the very end of the row, which become zeros.\n   - object\\_changes: The largest non-zero block moves to the rightmost side of the grid without changing its internal structure.\n\n2. **example\\_2\\_description** (similar to example\\_1\\_description):\n   - pixel\\_changes: Same as example\\_1\\_description.\n   - object\\_changes: Same as example\\_1\\_description.\n\n3. **example\\_3\\_description** (similar to example\\_1\\_description):\n   - pixel\\_changes: Same as example\\_1\\_description.\n   - object\\_changes: Same as example\\_1\\_description.\n\n4. **overall\\_pattern**: Move the largest non-zero block to the rightmost side of the grid while maintaining its internal structure.\n\n5. **instructions**:\n   - Identify the largest non-zero block in the grid.\n   - Cut out the identified block along with any zeros below or above it.\n   - Find the correct position for this block on the rightmost side of the grid.\n   - Insert the cutout back into the original grid at the new position.\n\n6. **test\\_case\\_input\\_copy**: `[[5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 7, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [0, 6, 0, 0]]`\n\n7. **test\\_case\\_grid\\_view**: There are four separate colored regions: two 5's, one 7, and one 6. Each region has other zeros around them.\n\n8. **test\\_case\\_object\\_view**: Two objects with value 5, one object with value 7, and one object with value 6. All objects touch the border of the grid.\n\n9. **test\\_case\\_transformation**: Move the largest non-zero block (in this case, either the 5's or 7) to the rightmost side of the grid while keeping their relative positions intact.\n\n10. **test\\_case\\_output**: Since we don't know whether the largest block consists of 5's or 7's, I will provide both possibilities:\n    - Option A: `[[5, 0, 0, 5], [7, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4], [6, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    - Option B: `[[5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7], [4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0]]`"
