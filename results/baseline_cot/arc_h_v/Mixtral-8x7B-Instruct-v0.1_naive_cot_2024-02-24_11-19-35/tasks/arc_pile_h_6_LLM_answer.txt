prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0]]
output: [[6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 4, 4]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 5, 5, 0]]
output: [[4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the solution in JSON format:

```json
{
  "example_1_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "In the output grid, each non-zero pixel moves one position to the left if there is no other non-zero pixel to its left.",
    "object_changes": "Objects do not change their color but may change their size due to merging and their coordinates due to shifting."
  },
  "example_2_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "Non-zero pixels move to the rightmost position in their row, leaving zeros behind.",
    "object_changes": "Objects maintain their color and merge with other objects in the same row while moving to the rightmost position."
  },
  "example_3_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "Similar to example 2, non-zero pixels move to the rightmost position in their column, leaving zeros behind.",
    "object_changes": "Objects maintain their color and merge with other objects in the same column while moving to the rightmost position."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "For each connected component (group of adjacent non-zero pixels) in the input grid, find the rightmost position in its row (examples 1 & 2) or column (example 3) where it can be placed without overlapping with other components. Place the component in that position, maintaining its original color and merging with any existing components in that position.",
  "instructions": "1. For each connected component in the input grid, determine its bounding box (minimum and maximum x and y coordinates).\n2. Find the rightmost empty column (x coordinate) within the bounding box.\n3. Move the whole connected component to the rightmost empty column found.\n4. Merge the moved component with any existing components in the destination column.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all connected components.",
  "test_case_input_copy": "[[0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 8, 0]]",
  "test_case_grid_view": "There are several groups of non-zero pixels scattered throughout the grid. Some columns contain multiple groups, while others don't have any non-zero pixels.",
  "test_case_object_view": "Four main objects exist in this grid: two red objects (color 4), one blue object (color 6), one green object (color 7), and two yellow objects (color 9). Each object has a unique set of coordinates and occupies a distinct area in the grid.",
  "test_case_transformation": "Move each group of non-zero pixels to the rightmost empty column within its bounding box, merging them with any existing groups in that column.",
  "test_case_output": [[0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0]]
