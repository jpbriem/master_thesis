prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the JSON format output for the given problem:

```json
{
  "example_1_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "In the input grid, there are two regions of color 2 that are initially separated but become connected in the output grid. This connection is made through the region of color 7, which remains unchanged.",
    "object_changes": "There are two objects of color 2 in the input grid, each represented as a set of adjacent pixels. In the output grid, these two objects merge into a single object due to the new connections formed."
  },
  "example_2_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "Similar to the previous example, there are two separate regions of color 2 in the input grid that become connected in the output grid through a region of color 7. However, this time the region of color 7 also gets modified in the process.",
    "object_changes": "Again, we start with two objects of color 2 that merge into one in the output grid. Additionally, the object of color 7 undergoes a change as well, growing larger and connecting the two regions of color 2."
  },
  "example_3_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "This example features an interesting twist where the initial region of color 2 does not directly connect to the final region of color 2. Instead, they are linked through multiple intermediate steps involving other colors.",
    "object_changes": "Starting with a single object of color 2, it gradually expands and contracts while changing its position in the grid during the transformation process. Eventually, it reaches its final form in the output grid."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "The underlying pattern involves identifying and merging separate regions of a specific color (in this case, color 2) by creating temporary paths using other colors (color 7). These paths may involve various intermediate steps, including expanding, contracting, and repositioning the target color's region before ultimately merging them together.",
  "instructions": "To perform the desired transformation, follow these steps:
  1. Identify separate regions of the target color (color 2).
  2. Create temporary paths using another color (color 7) to connect these regions.
  3. Merge the regions by adjusting their positions and sizes accordingly.
  4. Remove any unnecessary parts of the temporary path color (color 7), leaving only the merged regions of the target color.",

  "test_case_object_view": "There are four distinct objects in the grid: one large object consisting of sevens, and three smaller objects â€“ two groups of twos and one isolated seven. The two groups of twos are horizontally separated by a row of sevens, while the isolated seven is vertically separated from both groups of twos.",
  "test_case_transformation": "Merge the two groups of twos by creating a temporary path using the surrounding sevens. After merging, remove any excess sevens, leaving only the merged group of twos.",
