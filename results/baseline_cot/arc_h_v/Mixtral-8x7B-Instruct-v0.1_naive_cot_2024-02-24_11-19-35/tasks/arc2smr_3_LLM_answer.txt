prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Based on the given examples, the overall pattern seems to be that for every group of three non-zero numbers (representing pixels) in a row, if there is an empty space (represented by a zero) before the group, then a new object is created with the middle number of the group becoming the center of the new object. If there is already an existing object in the position where the new object would be created, then the two objects merge together. Here's the full description:

* Overall pattern: For each group of three non-zero numbers in a row, if there is an empty space before the group, create a new object with the middle number of the group becoming the center of the new object. If there is already an existing object in the position where the new object would be created, then the two objects merge together.
* Pixel changes: In the merged object, the center pixel remains unchanged while the other pixels take on the value of 1.
* Object changes: When two objects merge, they become a single object with the center pixel taking on the value of the original center pixel of the first object and the other pixels taking on the value of 1.
* Instructions: For each group of three non-zero numbers in a row, starting from the leftmost group, check if there is an empty space before the group. If so, create a new object with the middle number of the group becoming the center of the new object. If there is already an existing object in the position where the new object would be created, then the two objects merge together. Repeat this process until all groups have been checked.
* Test case input copy: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`
* Test case grid view: The grid has several groups of three non-zero numbers in a row, separated by empty spaces. Starting from the leftmost group, we see that there is an empty space before the group, so we create a new object with the middle number of the group becoming the center of the new object. We repeat this process for the next few groups, checking if there is an empty space before them. After processing all the groups, we get the final output grid.
* Test case object view: Initially, there are no objects in the grid. As we start processing the groups, we create new objects and merge them with any existing objects in their positions. By the end of the process, we have several merged objects spread throughout the grid.
* Test case transformation: The initial grid undergoes a series of merges and creations of new objects, resulting in the final output grid.
* Test case output: `array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]])`
