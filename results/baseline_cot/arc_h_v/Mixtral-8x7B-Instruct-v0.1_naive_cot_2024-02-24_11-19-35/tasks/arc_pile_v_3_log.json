            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\n[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 6, 3, 0, 2]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 0, 3]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6, 9, 3]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n Here's the solution for the given problem:\n\nThe overall pattern involves moving specific objects (based on their color) to the bottom right corner of the grid while preserving their relative positions. This can be broken down into several steps:\n\n1. Identify the objects that need to be moved. In this case, these are objects with color 1, 7, or 8.\n2. Determine the lowest row index `r` and rightmost column index `c` where any of these identified objects exist.\n3. For each object, calculate the difference in position compared to the target position (bottom-right corner).\n4. Move each object by subtracting the calculated differences from their current positions.\n\nBelow is the JSON formatted response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"example_1_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"In example 1, the pixels associated with objects having colors 3 and 6 were swapped diagonally.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Objects with color 3 and 6 changed places diagonally.\"\n    },\n    \"example_2_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"In example 2, the two horizontal rows consisting of color 2 were combined into the lower half of the grid.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Two separate objects with color 2 became a single object occupying the lower half of the grid.\"\n    },\n    \"example_3_description\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"Similar to example 1, pixels associated with objects having colors 3, 6, and 9 were swapped diagonally but in a larger grid.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Objects with color 3, 6, and 9 changed places diagonally.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"Identified objects are moved towards the bottom right corner while maintaining their relative positions.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To solve the problem, identify the objects based on their color, determine the new position for those objects in the bottom right corner, and move them accordingly by adjusting their x and y coordinates.\",\n    \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\",\n    \"test_case_grid_view\": \"There are five objects present in the grid - three objects with color 8, one object with color 1, one object with color 7, one object with color 2, and another object with color 9.\",\n    \"test_case_object_view\": \"Color 8 objects are located at the top left, middle left, and bottom left corners; color 1 is at the top center; color 7 is at the top right; color 2 is at the center; and color 9 is at the bottom center.\",\n    \"test_case_transformation\": \"Move the objects with color 8, 1, 7, and 2 toward the bottom right corner while keeping their relative positions intact.\",\n    \"test_case_output\": \"[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 2, 0, 1, 9]]\"\n}\n```"
