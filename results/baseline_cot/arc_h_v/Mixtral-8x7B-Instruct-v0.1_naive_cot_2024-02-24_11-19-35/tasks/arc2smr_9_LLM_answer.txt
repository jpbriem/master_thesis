prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
 Here is the output in JSON format:
```json
{
    "example_1_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, every pair of horizontally or vertically adjacent 4's is replaced with an 8 connecting them. This creates a chain reaction that fills in some of the empty spaces between the initial 4's.",
        "object_changes": "Objects do not change color, but their size and position may change due to the addition of 8's between certain 4's. Specifically, any two horizontally or vertically connected 4's will become part of the same larger object."
    },
    "example_2_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "Similar to the previous example, every pair of horizontally or vertically adjacent 4's is replaced with an 8 connecting them. However, since there are more isolated groups of 4's, the final result has more distinct objects than the first example.",
        "object_changes": "As in example 1, objects do not change color, but their size and position may change due to the addition of 8's between certain 4's. Each group of connected 4's becomes a single object, potentially growing in size when new 8's connect previously separate 4's."
    },
    "example_3_description": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example introduces a new configuration of 4's, where they form a diagonal line. When processed, each set of horizontally or vertically adjacent 4's (including diagonals) is replaced with an 8 connecting them. As before, this creates chains of 4's and 8's, filling in some of the empty spaces between the initial 4's.",
        "object_changes": "Objects maintain their original color (4), while their size and position may change due to the addition of 8's between certain 4's. Diagonal lines of 4's now become part of the same object, just like horizontal and vertical lines."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "Given an input grid with cells containing either 0's or 4's, the algorithm searches for pairs of horizontally or vertically adjacent 4's. It then replaces these pairs with an 8 connecting them, creating a chain reaction that fills in some of the empty spaces between the initial 4's. This results in larger objects made up of both 4's and 8's.",
    "instructions": "To apply the transformation, follow these steps:\n1. Identify all pairs of horizontally or vertically adjacent 4's.\n2. Replace each pair with an 8, ensuring that the 8 shares edges with both 4's.\n3. Continue this process until no further replacements can be made.",

    "test_case_object_view": "There are multiple objects in this grid, each consisting of 4's. Their sizes vary, and they are positioned differently throughout the grid.",
    "test_case_transformation": "When applying the transformation, look for opportunities to replace pairs of horizontally or vertically adjacent 4's with an 8. This will cause some 4's to merge into larger objects, and new 8's will appear in places where none existed before.",

Note: I am unable to provide a NumPy array directly here, but you can easily convert the final `test_case_output` string to a NumPy array using appropriate libraries.
