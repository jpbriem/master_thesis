prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[5, 2, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 2, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 9], [5, 2, 3, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 5, 0, 2], [3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 2], [3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 5, 1, 2]]

Example_3:
input: [[5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0], [5, 0, 8, 0, 4, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 2], [0, 3, 8, 2], [0, 0, 8, 2], [6, 0, 8, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the solution in JSON format:

```json
{
  "example_1_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "In the first example, the '5' and '6' colored pixels moved to the last row, while other pixels remained unchanged.",
    "object_changes": "There was one object initially (color '5'), which moved to the last row without changing its size."
  },
  "example_2_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "In this example, the '3' colored pixels in the first column moved to the bottom of the grid, preserving their original positions relative to each other.",
    "object_changes": "Two objects were present (two instances of color '3'). Both moved to the last row without any change in size or shape."
  },
  "example_3_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "Here, the '5' colored pixels moved to the rightmost column, maintaining their vertical alignment. Similarly, the '8' colored pixels shifted towards the right, keeping their horizontal position intact.",
    "object_changes": "Three objects existed in total - two instances of '5' and three instances of '8'. All these objects retained their sizes but changed their positions according to the described pattern."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "For a given non-zero integer value, find its leftmost and uppermost occurrence in the input grid. Then move that element along with all other identical elements to the rightmost column or bottommost row, respectively, while preserving their relative positions within the group.",
  "instructions": "Analyze each unique non-zero integer separately. For every such integer, locate its leftmost and uppermost appearance in the input grid. Starting from those cells, traverse horizontally and vertically through the whole grid, collecting all identical elements. Afterward, place them together in either the rightmost column or bottommost row accordingly.",
  "test_case_input_copy": "[[0, 3, 0, 2], [0, 3, 8, 2], [0, 0, 8, 2], [6, 0, 8, 0]]",
  "test_case_grid_view": "This grid contains four distinct colors spread across various locations. There are no '5' or '9' colored pixels, but there is one instance each of '2', '3', '6', and '8'.",
  "test_case_object_view": "There are four objects in total: an object consisting of two '2' colored pixels, another made up of two '3' colored pixels, a third one formed by one '6' colored pixel, and finally, an object having two '8' colored pixels.",
  "test_case_transformation": "Move the '3' colored pixels to the bottom row, followed by moving the '6' colored pixel to the rightmost column, then placing the '8' colored pixels below each other in the last row.",
