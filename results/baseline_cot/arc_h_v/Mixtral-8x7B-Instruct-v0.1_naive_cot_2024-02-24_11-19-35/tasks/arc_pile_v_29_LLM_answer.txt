prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 5, 0, 0], [1, 0, 6, 5, 0, 3]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 4], [0, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4], [0, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 9, 0, 6]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 9, 0, 6]]



Test case:
input: [[5, 2, 0, 0, 4], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [5, 2, 7, 3, 0], [0, 0, 7, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]

Sample Outputs:
 Here's the JSON format output for the given problem:

```json
{
  "example_1_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "In the output grid, the pink (5) and blue (6) objects moved one position up while maintaining their shapes. Additionally, the yellow (3) object appeared at the bottom right corner.",
    "object_changes": "Pink object changed its position from (3,4) to (3,1), keeping its size and shape. Blue object moved from (2,2) to (2,0), preserving its properties. A new yellow object was introduced at (5,5)."
  },
  "example_2_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "The green (7) and red (8) objects shifted downwards, filling the empty spaces left behind. The cyan (9) objects also moved accordingly.",
    "object_changes": "Green object relocated from (1,1) to (4,1), retaining its size and form. Red object moved from (3,4) to (5,4), preserving its properties. Cyan objects adjusted their positions according to the shift."
  },
  "example_3_description": {
    "pixel_changes": "No visible changes occurred in this example since there were no objects present initially that could undergo movements or transformations.",
    "object_changes": "There were no objects in the input grid; hence, no changes took place in the output grid."
  },
  "overall_pattern": "Objects move towards the direction where they maintain contact with other objects without changing their original shapes. If an object encounters another object during its movement, it moves around it instead of merging or overlapping.",
  "instructions": "Analyze each connected component of non-zero elements separately. Determine the destination cell for each object considering its current position and neighboring cells. Move the whole connected component to the calculated destination cell while preserving its shape. Fill any remaining empty space with zeros.",

  "test_case_grid_view": "This grid contains several distinct objects: two orange (5) objects at the top corners, a magenta (2) object at the top center, a light blue (4) object at the bottom left corner, and three other unique objects – a dark gray (7), a brown (3), and a lime (2) object – scattered across the grid. Each object has varying sizes and shapes.",
  "test_case_object_view": "There are six objects in total: Orange_1 with a size of 1 at (0,0), Orange_2 with a size of 1 at (4,0), Magenta with a size of 1 at (2,0), Light Blue with a size of 1 at (4,4), Dark Gray with a size of 1 at (2,3), and Brown with a size of 1 at (3,2).
