prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[1, 1, 0, 1, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 7, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my response in JSON format:

{
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input and output grids have the same pattern, but with some pixels changed. The changed pixels form new objects or modify existing ones.",
"object_changes": "Some objects have been created or modified, while others have disappeared."
},
"example_2_description": {"Ellipsis"},
"overall_pattern": "All input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern, where pixels are rearranged to create new objects or modify existing ones.",
"instructions": "Transform the input grid so that each row has at most one 8 and at most one 6, and no 0s. Rows with an 8 must have at least two non-zero pixels. Rows with a 6 must have exactly three non-zero pixels.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[0, 0, 0, 5]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The input grid consists of five rows, each with zero or more non-zero pixels.",
"test_case_object_view": "There are no obvious objects in the input grid, just scattered non-zero pixels.",
"test_case_transformation": "Transform the input grid so that it meets the criteria specified above.",
"test_case_output": "Expected output is a grid with the same dimensions as the input, containing only non-zero pixels."
}

Now, let me explain the reasoning behind each part of the response:

* "example_1_description": This section describes the changes between the input and output grids for Example 1. Since there are no obvious objects in the input grid, the output grid simply modifies the existing pixels to create new objects or modify existing ones.
* "example_2_description": This section is left blank because there is no Example 2 provided in the task.
* "overall_pattern": This section highlights the common pattern shared by all input-output pairs: pixels are rearranged to create new objects or modify existing ones.
* "instructions": This section provides explicit instructions for transforming the input grid. In this case, we need to ensure that each row has at most one 8 and at most one 6, and no 0s.
* "test_case_input_copy": This section copies the input grid into the response for reference purposes.
* "test_case_grid_view": This section describes the input grid as a whole, emphasizing that it consists of five rows with zero or more non-zero pixels.
* "test_case_object_view": This section focuses on the objects present in the input grid, noting that there are no obvious objects and only scattered non-zero pixels.
* "test_case_transformation": This section outlines the desired transformation of the input grid. We need to modify the grid so that it meets the criteria specified in the instructions.
* "test_case_output": This section specifies the expected output grid, which should contain only non-zero pixels and meet the criteria specified in the instructions.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
