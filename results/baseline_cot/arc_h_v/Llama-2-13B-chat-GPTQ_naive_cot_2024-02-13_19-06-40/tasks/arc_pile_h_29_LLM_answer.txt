You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 2, 2], [0, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with this task. Based on the information provided, it seems like we need to transform a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid using a specific set of rules. The input and output grids both have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color.

To start, let me summarize the key points of the task:

* Input and output grids are both 2D arrays of size (5, 5)
* Each element in the grid can take on one of nine possible values (1-9, and 0 for background)
* The goal is to transform the input grid into an output grid using a specific set of rules

Now, let me provide my understanding of the transformation rules based on the examples given:

* The transformation appears to be based on geometric and topological properties of the objects in the grid, such as lines, rectangles, and symmetry.
* Objects are defined as groups of adjacent pixels with the same color.
* The transformation involves copying, repeating, scaling, and rotating objects.
* The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid (5x5).

With that in mind, here's my proposed approach for transforming the input grid:

1. First, identify the objects in the input grid based on their color and proximity to each other.
2. Next, determine the type of transformation each object needs to undergo based on its geometry and topology. For example, some objects may need to be scaled up or down, while others may need to be rotated or reflected.
3. Apply the appropriate transformations to each object in the input grid. This may involve copying and repeating pixels, as well as adjusting the color values to match the desired outcome.
4. Once all objects have been transformed, combine them to create the final output grid.

Here's the code I would use to perform these steps:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the input grid
input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 5, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 2, 2, 2],
    [0, 7, 7, 0, 0],
    [0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
])

# Identify objects in the input grid
objects = []
for i in range(len(input_grid)):
    for j in range(len(input_grid[i])):
        if input_grid[i][j]!= 0:
            objects.append((i, j))

# Perform transformations on each object
transformed_objects = []
for obj in objects:
    # Determine the type of transformation needed
    # based on the object's geometry and topology
    if len(obj) > 1:
        # Scale the object up or down
        factor = np.random.uniform(low=0.5, high=2)
        obj = np.array([factor * x for x in obj])
    else:
        # Rotate or reflect the object
        angle = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=360)
        obj = np.array([np.cos(angle) * x + np.sin(angle) * y for x, y in obj])
    
    # Add the transformed object to the list
    transformed_objects.append(obj)

# Combine transformed objects to create the final output grid
output_grid = np.zeros((5, 5))
for obj in transformed_objects:
    output_grid += obj

print(output_grid)
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the task.
