The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

The input grid is a 2D array of pixels, each pixel having a color value (either 0 or 1). The goal is to transform the input grid into an output grid using specific rules based on object properties such as shape, size, and position.\n\nThere are three examples provided:\n\n* Example 1: The input grid has objects of various sizes and shapes, and the goal is to move them around while maintaining their proportions.\n* Example 2: The input grid has objects that need to be resized or scaled up/down while preserving their aspect ratio.\n* Example 3: The input grid has objects with specific colors that need to be replaced with other colors.\n\nThe expected output is a new grid with the desired transformations applied to the original objects.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the task:\n\n1. Understand the input grid structure and object properties (size, shape, color, etc.).\n2. Identify the desired transformations based on the examples given (movement, resizing, color replacement, etc.).\n3. Implement the transformations using appropriate algorithms and techniques (e.g., geometric transformations, image processing techniques).\n4. Test the output grid to ensure it meets the expected results.\n\nSome possible approaches to solve this task include:\n\n1. Using NumPy arrays to represent the grids and perform operations on them.\n2. Applying geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and reflection to objects in the grid.\n3. Utilizing image processing techniques like thresholding, edge detection, and color manipulation to modify object properties.\n4. Implementing object-based algorithms to identify and manipulate objects based on their properties."
