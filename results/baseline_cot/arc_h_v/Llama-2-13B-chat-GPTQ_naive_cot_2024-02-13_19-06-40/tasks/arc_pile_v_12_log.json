The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 8, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 7, 2, 6, 1]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 0], [8, 0, 1, 4, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I understand that you want me to help you with the task of transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid, based on certain rules and patterns. You've provided three examples of input-output pairs, and you'd like me to explain the transformation pattern and create the resulting output grid for a given test case.\n\nTo begin, let me summarize the key elements of the task:\n\n* Input grid: A 2D grid of pixels, represented as a list of lists, where each element is either 0 (background color) or a number (object color).\n* Output grid: The transformed version of the input grid, also represented as a list of lists.\n* Rules and patterns: The transformation should respect certain geometric and topological properties, such as lines, rectangles, and symmetries. Objects may move, change size, or change color.\n\nNow, let me dive into the details of the three examples you've provided.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1], [9, 8, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [9, 8, 0, 2, 6, 1], [9, 8, 7, 2, 6, 1]]\n\nIn this example, we see a grid with six objects of different colors. The transformation involves resizing objects, flipping them horizontally, and moving them around the grid. Objects 2 and 5 have changed color, while object 3 has moved to the bottom left corner.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 4, 0], [8, 0, 1, 4, 0]]\n\nHere, we have a simple grid with two objects of color 1. The transformation involves moving object 1 to the top right corner and changing its size.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [[0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1], [0, 0, 5, 0, 1]]\n\nThis example shows a grid with three objects of color 5. The transformation involves copying object 1 to the second row and third column, and changing its size.\n\nNow, let me turn my attention to the test case you've provided:\n\nInput: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]\n\nBased on the patterns and rules you've described, here's my interpretation of the desired transformation:\n\n1. Object 1 (at position [3, 9]) should move to the top left corner (position [0, 0]).\n2. Object 2 (at position [0, 4]) should move to the bottom right corner (position [3, 8]).\n3. Object 3 (at position [0, 5]) should move to the middle left (position [1, 4]).\n4. Object 4 (at position [3, 4]) should move to the middle right (position [2, 7]).\n5. Object 5 (at position [0, 7]) should move to the bottom left corner (position [1, 7]).\n6. Object 6 (at position [3, 8]) should move to the top right corner (position [2, 8]).\n\nWith these movements, the objects will form a new pattern that satisfies the given rules and patterns. Here's the resulting output grid:\n\nOutput: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 8], [3, 9, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8], [3, 0, 4, 0, 7, 8]]\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
