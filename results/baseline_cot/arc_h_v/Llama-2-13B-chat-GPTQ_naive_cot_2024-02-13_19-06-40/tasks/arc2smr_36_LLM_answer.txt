[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'm here to help you with your task. Based on the information provided, it seems like you need to transform an input grid of pixels into an output grid using certain rules and patterns. Here's what I understand so far:

* The input grid has dimensions (2, 5) and consists of integers between 0 and 4.
* Each element in the input grid represents a pixel with a specific color (0 for background, 2 for blue, 3 for red).
* There are three types of objects in the input grid:
	+ Rectangles with fixed sizes (e.g., [0, 2, 2, 0, 3])
	+ Single pixels with specific colors (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 4])
	+ Horizontal or vertical lines of connected pixels (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4])
* The output grid should also have dimensions (2, 5) and consist of integers between 0 and 4.
* The transformation should preserve the overall pattern and connectivity of the input grid, but possibly with some modifications such as resizing, rotating, or reflecting objects.

To help you further, I would need more information about the specific requirements and constraints of the task. Please provide me with the following details:

1. What is the goal of the transformation? Is it to create a new image with specific properties, or to analyze the input grid in some way?
2. Are there any specific rules or patterns that must be preserved or followed during the transformation?
3. Are there any restrictions on the allowed transformations, such as no stretching or shrinking objects beyond a certain limit?
4. How will the output grid be evaluated or judged? Will there be a specific evaluation metric or criteria?

Once I have this information, I can assist you better in understanding the task and providing a solution.
