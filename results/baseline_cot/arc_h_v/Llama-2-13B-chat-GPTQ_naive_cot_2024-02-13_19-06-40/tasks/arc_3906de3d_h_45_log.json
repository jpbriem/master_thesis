The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

I'm here to help you with the task. To start, I will provide a brief overview of the task and then proceed with the instructions.\n\nTask Overview:\n----------------\n\nYou are given a set of input-output pairs, where each pair consists of an input grid and an associated output grid. Your goal is to infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid. The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a pixel color.\n\nInput-Output Pairs:\n-------------------\n\nYou will be provided with three input-output pairs, each consisting of an input grid and an associated output grid. These pairs are examples of the desired transformation pattern, and you must apply the appropriate transformation to the input grid to produce the output grid.\n\nTransformations:\n--------------\n\nThe transformations to be applied to the input grid are based on geometric and topological features, such as lines, rectangles, and connected pixels. You may need to use arithmetical operations, such as counting and sorting, to determine the correct transformations.\n\nInstructions:\n-------------\n\nYour task is to write a Python function that takes the input grid and outputs the corresponding output grid. The function should take the following inputs:\n\n* `input_grid`: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.\n* `output_grid`: A 2D numpy array representing the output grid.\n\nThe function should perform the following steps:\n\n1. Describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs.\n2. Provide a detailed step-by-step description of the transformation process.\n3. Create the resulting output grid as a numpy array.\n\nTest Case Input Copy:\n---------------------\n\nPlease copy the test case input grid from the task below and paste it into the `input_grid` variable.\n\nTest Case Grid View:\n----------------------\n\nPlease describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.\n\nTest Case Object View:\n-----------------------\n\nPlease describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n\nTest Case Transformation:\n-------------------------\n\nPlease describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.\n\nTest Case Output:\n------------------\n\nPlease create the resulting output grid as a numpy array.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
