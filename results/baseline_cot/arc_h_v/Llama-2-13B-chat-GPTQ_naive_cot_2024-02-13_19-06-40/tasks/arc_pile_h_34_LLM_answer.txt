You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this task.

So, it seems like we have three examples of input-output pairs, each with a specific pattern of transformation. The task is to infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then apply the transformation to a new input grid.

Let's start by analyzing the examples.

Example 1:
The input grid has five pixels, and the output grid has the same structure but with some changes in the values. The transformation appears to be a simple shift of the values by one position to the right.

Example 2:
This example is similar to the previous one, but with more complex patterns. The input grid has six pixels, and the output grid has the same structure but with some changes in the values. The transformation seems to involve reflecting the values across the diagonal, and also shifting them by one position to the right.

Example 3:
In this example, the input grid has six pixels, and the output grid has the same structure but with some changes in the values. The transformation appears to involve scaling the values by a factor of two, and also shifting them by one position to the right.

Now, let's move on to the test case input grid:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 2, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]
```
To describe the input grid, we can say that it consists of five rows and four columns, with the following pixel values: 0, 0, 0, 7, and 0.

Next, we need to infer the relation between the input and output grids. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation involves shifting the values by one position to the right, and possibly reflecting them across the diagonal. We can also see that the output grid will have the same structure as the input grid, with the same number of rows and columns.

Finally, we need to apply the transformation to the test case input grid. Using the patterns we observed from the examples, we can create the output grid as follows:
```
[[7, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0]]
```
Here's the resulting output grid, which we can represent in JSON format as follows:
```json
{
  "example_1_description": {"pixel_changes": "shifted by one position to the right", "object_changes": "no changes"},
  "example_2_description": {"pixel_changes": "reflected across the diagonal and shifted by one position to the right", "object_changes": "no changes"},
  "example_3_description": {"pixel_changes": "scaled by a factor of two and shifted by one position to the right", "object_changes": "no changes"},
  "overall_pattern": "shifted by one position to the right",
  "instructions": "shift the values by one position to the right",
  "test_case_input_copy": "[0, 0, 0, 7, 0]",
  "test_case_grid_view": "a grid with 5 rows and 4 columns, with pixel values [0, 0, 0, 7, 0]",
  "test_case_object_view": "no objects",
  "test_case_transformation": "shift the values by one position to the right",
  "test_case_output": "[7, 0, 0, 2, 2]"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
