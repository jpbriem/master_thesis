The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]]\noutput: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this task.\n\nSo, it seems like we have three examples of input-output pairs, each with a specific pattern of transformation. The task is to infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then apply the transformation to a new input grid.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the examples.\n\nExample 1:\nThe input grid has five rows and two columns, with each cell containing a value from 0 to 9. The output grid has the same dimensions and layout as the input grid, but with all cells set to the same value (either 7 or 0). The transformation appears to be a simple shift operation, where all cells are moved by the same amount in the horizontal direction.\n\nExample 2:\nThis example is similar to the first one, but with a different pattern of transformation. The input grid has six rows and three columns, with each cell containing a value from 0 to 8. The output grid again has the same dimensions and layout as the input grid, but with all cells set to the same value (either 8 or 0). This time, the transformation appears to be a rotation operation, where all cells are rotated by the same angle.\n\nExample 3:\nIn this example, the input grid has four rows and three columns, with each cell containing a value from 0 to 7. The output grid has the same dimensions and layout as the input grid, but with all cells set to the same value (either 7 or 0). However, this time, the transformation appears to be more complex, involving both shifting and scaling operations.\n\nNow that we understand the patterns of transformation for these examples, let's move on to the test case. Our input grid has four rows and two columns, with each cell containing a value from 0 to 8. We need to apply the appropriate transformation to produce an output grid with the same dimensions and layout.\n\nBased on the examples we've seen so far, it seems likely that the transformation will involve shifting and/or scaling operations. To determine the exact nature of the transformation, we'll need to carefully analyze the input grid and identify any patterns or symmetries that could guide our transformation.\n\nHere are some observations about the input grid:\n\n* There are no noise pixels (i.e., pixels with value 0).\n* The grid has a clear diagonal symmetry, with alternating bands of dark and light colors.\n* Each row has the same number of dark and light pixels.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here's my proposed transformation:\n\n1. Rotate the grid by 90 degrees clockwise, so that the diagonals become horizontal lines.\n2. Scale the grid by a factor of 2 in both the x and y directions, so that each cell becomes twice as large.\n3. Shift the grid by (2, 2) units to the right and down, so that the top-left corner of the output grid is aligned with the center of the input grid.\n\nApplying these transformations to the input grid yields the following output grid:\n```\n[[8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [8, 2, 2, 8, 8],\n [8, 5, 5, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 8, 8]]\n```\nI hope this solution meets your requirements! Please let me know if there are any issues or if you would like me to elaborate further on my reasoning."
