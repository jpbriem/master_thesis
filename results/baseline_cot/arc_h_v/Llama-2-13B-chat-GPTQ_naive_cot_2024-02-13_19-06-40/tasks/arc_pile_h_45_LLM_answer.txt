You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6]]
output: [[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 8]]
output: [[9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with this task.

From looking at the examples provided, it seems that the task involves transforming a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid, based on certain rules and patterns. The input and output grids both consist of integers representing different pixel colors, with 0 representing the background color.

Here are some observations about the examples:

* Example 1 has a symmetric pattern of alternating colors, with each row having the same color scheme. The transformation appears to involve scaling and shifting the pattern horizontally.
* Example 2 has a more complex pattern with multiple colors and shapes. It looks like the transformation involves resizing and rotating the objects, as well as flipping them horizontally.
* Example 3 has a simpler pattern with just two colors. The transformation appears to involve scaling and shifting the pattern vertically.

Based on these examples, here are my inferences about the relation between the input and output grids:

* The input grid represents a 2D image or pattern, while the output grid represents the transformed version of that image or pattern.
* The transformation involves geometric operations such as scaling, rotation, reflection, and translation, as well as color manipulation.
* The transformation preserves the overall structure and connectivity of the grid, but may introduce new features or patterns based on the given rules and patterns.

Now, let me describe the input and output grids for the test case provided:

Input Grid:
```
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[9, 0, 9, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 6, 6, 0, 0]
```
Output Grid:
```
[4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[9, 0, 9, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 6, 6, 0, 0]
```
As there is no obvious transformation pattern in the test case, I will proceed with the instructions provided:

1. Copy the test case input grid from the task: `[4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0]`.
2. Describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns: The input grid consists of five rows and three columns of pixels, with each pixel represented by an integer value. The patterns in the grid include horizontal stripes of alternating colors, as well as isolated pixels of different colors.
3. Describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number: There are five objects in the input grid, each consisting of a group of connected pixels with a specific color. The objects are irregularly shaped and vary in size.
4. Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed: Based on the examples provided, the transformation should involve geometric operations such as scaling, rotation, reflection, and translation, as well as color manipulation.
5. Create the resulting output grid as a numpy array: Here is the resulting output grid for the test case: `[[4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0, 0]]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
