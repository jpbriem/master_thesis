The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

I'm happy to help you with this task. Based on the provided examples and instructions, here's my understanding of the task:\n\nWe need to write a function that takes an input grid of integers (representing colors) and produces an output grid of integers. The input grid has dimensions (N, M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns. Each element of the input grid is either 0 (background color) or 1-9 (foreground colors).\n\nThe goal is to apply a transformation to the input grid such that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but with certain properties:\n\n* Objects: The output grid should contain objects of various sizes and shapes, with each object having a unique color.\n* Symmetry: The objects in the output grid should have symmetry properties, such as mirroring, rotating, and translating.\n* Patterns: The output grid should exhibit interesting patterns, such as stripes, polka dots, and other geometric shapes.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will need to define a set of rules or transformations that can be applied to the input grid. These rules may include:\n\n* Connecting points: Connecting points are points in the grid where two or more objects touch each other.\n* Orthogonal projections: Objects in the output grid should be projected onto the grid boundaries in an orthogonal manner.\n* Shape upscaling or downscaling: Objects in the output grid should have varying sizes and shapes, with some objects larger than others.\n* Elastic distortions: Objects in the output grid should be subject to elastic distortions, meaning they should be stretched, compressed, or otherwise deformed to fit within the grid boundaries.\n\nTo formalize these rules, we can define a set of functions that take the input grid and produce the output grid according to the specified rules. For example, we might define a function called `connect_points` that connects points in the input grid to form objects, another function called `orthogonal_projections` that projects objects onto the grid boundaries, and so on.\n\nOnce we have defined these functions, we can use them to transform the input grid into the output grid. We can then verify that the output grid satisfies the desired properties, such as symmetry, patterns, and object colors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the task."
