[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'm happy to help you with this task. Based on the provided examples and instructions, here's my understanding of the task:

We need to write a function that takes an input grid of integers (representing colors) and produces an output grid of integers. The input grid has dimensions (N, M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns. Each element of the input grid is either 0 (background color) or 1-9 (foreground colors).

The goal is to apply a transformation to the input grid such that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but with certain properties:

* The output grid must have the same number of objects (i.e., connected regions of the same color) as the input grid.
* Each object in the output grid must have the same color as its corresponding object in the input grid.
* The boundaries of each object in the output grid must be aligned with the boundaries of their corresponding objects in the input grid.
* The size of each object in the output grid may change compared to its corresponding object in the input grid.

There are three examples provided, each with its own specific transformation pattern. We need to generalize these patterns to create a function that can handle any input grid.

Here's my proposed solution:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform_grid(grid):
    # Step 1: Find objects in the input grid
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i]!= 0:
            objects.append((i, grid[i]))
    
    # Step 2: Apply transformation to each object
    transformed_objects = []
    for obj in objects:
        x, y = obj
        if grid[x][y] == 2: # special case for object 2
            # Apply transformation to object 2
            transformed_objects.append((x + 1, y + 1))
        else:
            # Apply translation to other objects
            transformed_objects.append((x + 1, y))
    
    # Step 3: Create the output grid
    output_grid = np.zeros((len(grid), len(grid)))
    for obj in transformed_objects:
        output_grid[obj[0]][obj[1]] = grid[obj[0]][obj[1]]
    
    return output_grid
```
This function takes an input grid `grid` and applies the following steps:

Step 1: Find objects in the input grid. We iterate over each element of the grid and check if it's not 0. If it's not 0, we add it to a list of objects.

Step 2: Apply transformation to each object. We iterate over the list of objects and apply a transformation depending on the object's color. For object 2, we apply a special transformation (moving up and to the right). For other objects, we apply a translation (moving one position to the right and down).

Step 3: Create the output grid. We create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, and fill it with the transformed objects.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
