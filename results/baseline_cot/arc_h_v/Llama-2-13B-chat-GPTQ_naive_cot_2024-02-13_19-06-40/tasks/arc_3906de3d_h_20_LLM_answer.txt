[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

  Sure! I'm here to help you with the task. To start, I will provide a brief overview of the task and then proceed with the instructions.

Task Overview:
----------------

You are given a set of input-output pairs, where each pair consists of an input grid and an associated output grid. Your goal is to infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid. The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a pixel color.

Input-Output Pairs:
-------------------

You are provided with three example input-output pairs: Example_1, Example_2, and Example_3. Each example has a unique transformation pattern that you need to understand and apply to the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid.

Instructions:
--------------

Your task is to:

1. Describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs.
2. Provide a detailed step-by-step description of the transformation actions required to transform the input grid into the output grid for each example.
3. Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array for each example.

Test Case Input Copy:
---------------------

Please copy the test case input grid from the task.

Test Case Grid View:
----------------------

Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.

Test Case Object View:
-----------------------
