The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 2, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 2, 1]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 1, 5, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my analysis of the given input-output pairs and the test case:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 2, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 2, 1]]\n\nPattern: The input grid has four objects of different sizes and colors. In the output grid, each object is resized to the same size (2x2 pixels) and their colors are modified such that each object now consists of two identical copies of the original color, placed side by side.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput: [[0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]\n\nPattern: The input grid has three objects of the same color (7). In the output grid, each object remains unchanged but is shifted one pixel to the right.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nInput: [[4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 1, 5, 0]]\n\nPattern: The input grid has four objects of different sizes and colors. In the output grid, each object is rescaled to a fixed size (4x4 pixels) and their colors are modified such that each object now consists of five identical copies of the original color, arranged in a 2x2 matrix.\n\n**Test Case:**\n\nInput: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nBased on the patterns observed in the example inputs, we can expect the following transformation for the test case input:\n\n* Each object will be resized to a fixed size (e.g., 2x2 or 4x4 pixels)\n* Colors may be modified, such as duplicating or modifying the hue, saturation, or brightness of each object\n* Objects may be shifted or translated by one or more pixels\n\nHere's the expected output grid for the test case input:\n```json\n{\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"resizing objects to 2x2 pixels\",\n\"object_changes\": \"duplicating colors, shifting objects by 1 pixel\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"no changes\",\n\"object_changes\": \"no changes\"\n},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"resize and duplicate objects, shift by 1 pixel\",\n\"instructions\": \"resize objects to 2x2 pixels, duplicate colors, shift by 1 pixel\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"a grid with four objects of different sizes and colors, with some objects shifted by one pixel\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"four objects with different colors and sizes, with some objects shifted by one pixel\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"resize objects to 2x2 pixels, duplicate colors, shift by 1 pixel\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"[array([0, 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 0, 0, 0]), array([9, 0, 0, 0])]\"\n}\n```\nNote that this is just an expected outcome based on the patterns observed in the example inputs, and the actual output may differ depending on the specific requirements of the task."
