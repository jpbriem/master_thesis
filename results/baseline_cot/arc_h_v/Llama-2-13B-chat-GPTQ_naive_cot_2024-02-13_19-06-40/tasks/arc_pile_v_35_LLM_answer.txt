You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0], [4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0], [4, 0, 6, 8, 5, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 7, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 9, 7, 0, 2]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 6], [8, 3, 4, 6], [8, 3, 4, 0], [0, 3, 4, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this task.

So, let me understand the task correctly - we have an input grid of pixels, and we need to transform it into an output grid of pixels based on certain rules. The input and output grids both have values from 1 to 9, representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid.

I see that there are three examples provided, each with their own input and output grids. The first example has a simple transformation where all pixels are set to 0, the second example has a more complex transformation where some pixels are set to 0 and others are set to a new value based on the original value, and the third example has a combination of translation and scaling applied to the grid.

To begin, I will start by analyzing the input grid and identifying any patterns or objects within it. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the transformation is looking for specific patterns or objects within the grid and applying a transformation to them.

For the first example, I notice that there are several runs of consecutive pixels with the same value (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]) that could potentially be considered as objects. Additionally, there are some isolated pixels with values other than 0 or 5 that could also be considered as noise pixels.

For the second example, I see that there is a single object within the grid that consists of four connected pixels with the value 2.

For the third example, I observe that there are several objects within the grid, each consisting of a few connected pixels with consistent values. These objects appear to be translated and scaled versions of each other.

Based on these observations, I will proceed to transform the input grid into the output grid according to the given examples and instructions. Please provide me with the test case input grid so that I can begin the transformation process.
