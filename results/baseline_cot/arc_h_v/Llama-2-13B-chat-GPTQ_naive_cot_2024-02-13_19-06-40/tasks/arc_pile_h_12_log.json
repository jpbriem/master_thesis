The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I understand that you want me to help you with the given task. Here's my understanding of the task based on the information provided:\n\n* We have an input grid of pixels represented as a 2D list of integers, where each integer value represents a pixel color (one of 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9).\n* Each pixel has a set of properties such as color, coordinates, size, shape, and object number.\n* The goal is to transform the input grid into an output grid using a specific pattern of transformations.\n* The pattern of transformations includes geometric and topological operations such as lines, rectangles, connecting points, orthogonal projections, symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations, scaling, and elastic deformations.\n* The transformations can also involve object properties such as color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n* The input-output relationship is valid for all input-output pairs, and the transformation pattern is the same for all examples.\n\nBased on this understanding, here's my response in JSON format:\n\n{\n\"example_1_description\": {\n\"pixel_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, the main change in the pixels is the reshuffling of colors, with some pixels changing their color to a neighboring pixel's color.\",\n\"object_changes\": \"Regarding the first example, the objects remain the same, but their sizes and positions change due to the geometric and topological transformations.\"\n},\n\"example_2_description\": {\"ellipsis\"},\n\"overall_pattern\": \"The input-output relationship is valid for all input-output pairs, and the transformation pattern is the same for all examples. The pattern involves geometric and topological operations, object properties, and noise pixels.\",\n\"instructions\": \"Describe the required transformation actions in detail, step by step.\",\n\"test_case_input_copy\": \"Copy the test case input grid from the task.\",\n\"test_case_grid_view\": \"Regarding the test input, the pixels form a grid with a repeating pattern of colors and objects.\",\n\"test_case_object_view\": \"Regarding the test input, the objects are distinct regions of pixels with specific colors and sizes.\",\n\"test_case_transformation\": \"Apply the specified transformation pattern to the input grid, taking into account the object properties and the geometric and topological relationships between pixels.\",\n\"test_case_output\": \"Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.\"\n}\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you need assistance with."
