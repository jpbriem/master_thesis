[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9], [7, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9], [7, 0, 0, 9], [7, 0, 0, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 2, 6, 0, 0], [5, 2, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 2, 0, 0, 0], [5, 2, 0, 0, 0], [5, 2, 6, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7], [9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7], [9, 0, 0, 7], [9, 0, 0, 7]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 9, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 6], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my response in JSON format:

{
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has no changes in pixels, as it is already fully filled with the background color (0).",
"object_changes": "There are no objects in the input grid."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has new pixels added with value 5, and existing pixels with value 2 now have a new coordinate (0,0).",
"object_changes": "New objects with value 5 have been created, and existing objects with value 2 have moved to the origin (0,0)."
},
"example_3_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has no changes in pixels, as it is already fully filled with the background color (0).",
"object_changes": "There are no objects in the input grid."
},
"overall_pattern": "All input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern: new pixels are added to the grid, and existing pixels are shifted by a fixed amount (1,1) in both the x and y directions.",
"instructions": "To transform the input grid, simply copy each row of pixels and shift them one position to the right and one position downwards, so that each row becomes the next row. This will fill the entire grid with the background color (0).",
"test_case_input_copy": "[0, 9, 7, 0]",
"test_case_grid_view": "The input grid consists of four rows of pixels, with the top two rows having values 0 and 9, respectively, and the bottom two rows having values 7 and 0, respectively.",
"test_case_object_view": "There are no objects in the input grid.",
"test_case_transformation": "Transform the input grid by copying each row of pixels and shifting them one position to the right and one position downwards, so that each row becomes the next row.",
"test_case_output": np.array([[0, 9, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7, 6], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]])
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
