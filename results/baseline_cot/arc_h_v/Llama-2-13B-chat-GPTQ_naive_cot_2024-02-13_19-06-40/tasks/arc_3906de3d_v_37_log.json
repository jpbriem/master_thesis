The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the fields.\n\n<</SYS>>\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [6, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0], [6, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 6, 0], [6, 9, 6, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9, 6, 0], [6, 9, 6, 9, 0, 6, 9, 9, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 9, 9, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 9, 9, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 6, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\n[/INST]\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n  Sure! I'm here to help you with the task. To start, I will provide a brief overview of the task and then proceed with the instructions.\n\nTask Overview:\n----------------\n\nYou are given a set of input-output pairs, where each pair consists of an input grid and an associated output grid. Your goal is to infer the relation between the input and output grids and transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid. The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a specific color (either 0 or 1).\n\nInput-Output Pairs:\n-------------------\n\nYou are provided with three example input-output pairs: Example_1, Example_2, and Example_3. Each example has a unique input-output pair, and they share the same underlying transformation pattern. Your task is to generalize this pattern to create the output grid for any given input grid.\n\nInstructions:\n--------------\n\n1. **Transform the input grid into the output grid**: Given an input grid, your task is to transform it into the corresponding output grid using the underlying transformation pattern.\n2. **Describe the transformation pattern**: For each example, please describe the transformation pattern in plain English, highlighting the key features and properties of the pattern.\n3. **Provide JSON output**: For each example, please provide a JSON object that includes the following information:\n\t* `example_1_description`: A description of the transformation pattern for Example_1.\n\t* `example_2_description`: A description of the transformation pattern for Example_2.\n\t* `example_3_description`: A description of the transformation pattern for Example_3.\n\t* `overall_pattern`: A brief summary of the overall transformation pattern.\n\t* `test_case_input_copy`: A copy of the test case input grid.\n\t* `test_case_grid_view`: A description of the input grid, focusing on patterns.\n\t* `test_case_object_view`: A description of the objects in the input grid, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.\n\t* `test_case_transformation`: A description of the required transformation actions in detail, step by step.\n\t* `test_case_output`: The expected output grid.\n\nPlease note that the input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer value represents a specific color (either 0 or 1).\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
