You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]]
output: [[5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]
output: [[4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with this task. From the given examples and the description of the task, it seems that the goal is to transform a 2D input grid of pixels into a corresponding output grid based on certain rules and patterns. Here's my understanding of the task:

* The input grid is a 2D array of integers representing the colors of the pixels.
* The output grid is also a 2D array of integers representing the colors of the transformed pixels.
* The transformation involves applying geometric and topological operations such as lines, rectangles, and reflections to the pixels in the input grid.
* The transformation can also involve copying, repeating, and resizing objects in the input grid.
* The output grid should represent the transformed version of the input grid, with the same dimensions and pixel structure.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the transformation pattern involves creating copies of objects, resizing them, and moving them around the grid. The specific instructions for each example are as follows:

* Example 1: Create a copy of the top-left object and move it to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
* Example 2: Resize the top-left object to twice its original size and move it to the center of the grid.
* Example 3: Create a copy of the top-left object and move it to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

To solve this task, I will need to carefully examine the input grid and apply the appropriate transformations to produce the correct output grid. I will work through each example individually and make sure to document my reasoning and steps taken.

Here is the initial input grid:
```json
[[0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8], [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0]]
```
And here is the desired output grid:
```json
[[5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 6], [7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8], [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0]]
```
I will now proceed to apply the transformations described in the examples to produce the correct output grid. Please let me know if there are any further instructions or clarifications needed.
