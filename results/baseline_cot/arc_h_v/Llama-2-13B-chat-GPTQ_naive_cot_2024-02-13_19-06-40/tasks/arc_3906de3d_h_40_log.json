The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

I'm here to help you with the task. To start, I will provide a brief overview of the task and then break it down into smaller parts to make it easier to understand.\n\nOverview:\n------------\n\nYou are given a set of input-output pairs, where each pair consists of an input grid and an associated output grid. Your goal is to infer the relation between the input and output grids and then transform the input grid into the corresponding output grid. The input and output grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, where each integer corresponds to a pixel value (either 0 or 1).\n\nInput-Output Pairs:\n-------------------\n\nEach input-output pair is described by a brief example and a list of properties that the output grid should satisfy. You need to study these examples carefully and pay attention to the properties listed below each example. These properties will be useful in helping you understand the desired output for each input.\n\nProperties:\n--------------\n\n* **Geometry and topology**: The input and output grids have the same dimensions (2x5) and consist of pixels with values either 0 or 1.\n* **Objects**: Each object in the input grid is defined by a set of connected pixels with the same color (either 0 or 1). Objects can touch each other but cannot overlap.\n* **Patterns**: The input and output grids exhibit specific patterns, such as lines, rectangles, and symmetry.\n* **Arithmetic operations**: The output grid is obtained by applying certain arithmetic operations to the input grid, such as counting, sorting, and copying pixels.\n\nNow, let me walk you through each input-output pair, starting with Example 1. Please pay close attention to the properties listed for each example, as they will be important in determining the correct output for each input.\n\nExample 1:\n-----------\n\nInput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nOutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nPlease note that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (2x5). Now, please proceed to transform the input grid into the output grid using the instructions provided above."
