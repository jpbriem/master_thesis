prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 6, 3, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 8, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0], [7, 5, 8, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my response in JSON format:

{
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "No changes",
"object_changes": "No changes"
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "Swap positions of 7 and 5 in second row",
"object_changes": "None"
},
"example_3_description": {
"pixel_changes": "Flip vertically",
"object_changes": "None"
},
"overall_pattern": "Symmetric reflection about vertical axis",
"instructions": "Reflect the input grid symmetrically about the vertical axis.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[1, 0, 4, 0]",
"test_case_grid_view": "Grid looks like a rectangle with four equal rows and columns, each containing a single color (4).",
"test_case_object_view": "No objects detected.",
"test_case_transformation": "Reflect the grid vertically about the y-axis.",
"test_case_output": "[0, 0, 4, 0]"}

Now, let me explain each part of the response:

* "example_1_description": This section describes the changes between the input and output grids for Example 1. Since there are no changes, both the pixel and object changes are listed as "No changes".
* "example_2_description": This section describes the changes between the input and output grids for Example 2. The pixel changes are "Swap positions of 7 and 5 in second row", and there are no object changes.
* "example_3_description": This section describes the changes between the input and output grids for Example 3. The pixel changes are "Flip vertically", and there are no object changes.
* "overall_pattern": This field describes the general pattern that applies to all input-output pairs. In this case, the pattern is symmetric reflection about the vertical axis.
* "instructions": These instructions tell you what to do to transform the input grid into the output grid. In this case, reflect the input grid symmetrically about the vertical axis.
* "test_case_input_copy": This field contains a copy of the test input grid. You can use this to verify that your transformation works correctly.
* "test_case_grid_view": This field describes the view of the test input grid. In this case, the grid looks like a rectangle with four equal rows and columns, each containing a single color (4).
* "test_case_object_view": This field describes the objects in the test input grid. Since there are no objects, this field is empty.
* "test_case_transformation": This field describes the transformation that needs to be applied to the test input grid to produce the output grid. In this case, reflect the grid vertically about the y-axis.
* "test_case_output": This field contains the expected output grid. In this case, the output grid is simply the input grid reflected vertically about the y-axis.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
