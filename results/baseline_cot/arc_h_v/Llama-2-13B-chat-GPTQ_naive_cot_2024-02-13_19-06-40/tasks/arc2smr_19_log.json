The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}.

The input grid represents an image, and each cell's value indicates the color of that cell. The goal is to transform the input grid into an output grid while preserving certain properties, such as object boundaries and color consistency.\n\nHere are some possible approaches to solve this task:\n\n1. Image segmentation: Divide the input grid into smaller regions based on color or texture features. Each region can be assigned a unique label or color.\n2. Object recognition: Identify specific objects within the image, such as lines, shapes, or text. Apply transformations to these objects while maintaining their original boundaries and colors.\n3. Geometric transformations: Apply affine or non-affine transformations to the objects, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. These transformations can help align objects correctly and improve overall aesthetics.\n4. Color adjustments: Adjust the brightness, contrast, or saturation of specific objects or regions to enhance their appearance or create visual harmony.\n5. Symmetry and repetition: Look for symmetrical patterns or repeated elements in the input grid and apply corresponding transformations to create balance and coherence.\n6. Noise reduction: Remove random noise or artifacts from the input grid using filters or thresholding techniques.\n7. Composition: Consider the overall composition of the output grid, ensuring that the arranged objects form a visually appealing and balanced whole.\n\nTo achieve these goals, you may need to employ various image processing techniques, such as edge detection, histogram equalization, or morphological operations. Additionally, you may want to explore libraries like OpenCV or scikit-image to facilitate your work."
