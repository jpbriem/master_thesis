You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 5], [0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 5], [4, 7, 0, 3, 8, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 3, 8, 5], [0, 7, 0, 3, 8, 5], [4, 7, 0, 3, 8, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[9, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [9, 8, 2, 3, 0, 7], [9, 8, 2, 3, 0, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 7]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure! I'll do my best to help you with this task.

So, it seems like we have three examples of input-output pairs, each with a specific transformation pattern. The task is to infer the relation between the input and output grids, and then apply the transformation to a new input grid.

Let me start by analyzing the examples.

Example 1 has a simple transformation where all pixels are set to zero. So, the input and output grids are the same, but with all pixels set to zero.

Example 2 has a more complex transformation where some pixels are set to zero, while others are set to the value of the previous pixel. Specifically, the even-numbered pixels are set to zero, while the odd-numbered pixels are set to the value of the previous pixel. This creates a zigzag pattern across the grid.

Example 3 has a still more complex transformation where some pixels are set to zero, while others are set to the value of the previous pixel, but with a twist. Specifically, the even-numbered pixels are set to the value of the previous pixel, while the odd-numbered pixels are set to zero. This creates a diagonal pattern across the grid.

Now, let me turn my attention to the test case input grid:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 5, 9, 0, 0]

Hmmm... it looks like this input grid has a similar pattern to Example 2, where some pixels are set to zero, while others are set to the value of the previous pixel. Specifically, the even-numbered pixels are set to zero, while the odd-numbered pixels are set to the value of the previous pixel.

Okay, so the transformation pattern for this input grid is the same as Example 2. To apply the transformation, I need to set all even-numbered pixels to zero, and all odd-numbered pixels to the value of the previous pixel. Here's the resulting output grid:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]
[8, 0, 5, 9, 0, 0]

Looks good! All pixels have been transformed according to the pattern established in Examples 2 and 3.

Now, let me provide the requested information in JSON format:

{
"example_1_description": {"pixel_changes": "no changes", "object_changes": "no changes"},
"example_2_description": {"pixel_changes": "set all even-numbered pixels to zero, set all odd-numbered pixels to the value of the previous pixel", "object_changes": "no changes"},

"instructions": "apply the transformation pattern to the input grid",
"test_case_input_copy": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]",
