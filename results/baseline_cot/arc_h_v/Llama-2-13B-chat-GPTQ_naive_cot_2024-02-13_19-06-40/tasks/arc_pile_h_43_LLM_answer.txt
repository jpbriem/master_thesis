You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0]]
output: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 4, 4, 4], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[4, 4, 4, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my analysis of the given input-output pairs and the test case:

**Example 1:**

Input: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0]]
Output: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]

Pattern: The input grid has four objects of different colors (blue, green, red, and yellow). In the output grid, each object is replaced by a new object with the same color but with all pixels set to the same value (i.e., blue becomes purple, green becomes cyan, red becomes magenta, and yellow becomes black).

**Example 2:**

Input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Pattern: The input grid has three objects of the same color (purple). In the output grid, each object is duplicated and shifted horizontally by one pixel to create six identical copies of the original objects.

**Example 3:**

Input: [[0, 4, 4, 4], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[4, 4, 4, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Pattern: The input grid has four objects of different colors (red, green, blue, and yellow). In the output grid, each object is replaced by a new object with the same color but with all pixels set to the same value (i.e., red becomes pink, green becomes turquoise, blue becomes indigo, and yellow becomes white).

**Test Case:**

Input: [[9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0]]

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can expect that the test case input will also involve objects of different colors being transformed in some way. However, since there are no obvious patterns or symmetries in the input grid, we may need to look more closely at the individual objects and their properties to determine the correct transformation.

Here's my analysis of the test case input:

* Object 1 (top left): Color 9, size 3x2
* Object 2 (bottom left): Color 6, size 3x2
* Object 3 (center): Color 5, size 2x2
* Object 4 (top right): Color 3, size 2x1

Based on the patterns observed in the previous examples, we can try the following transformation rules:

1. All objects will be replaced by new objects with the same color but with all pixels set to the same value.
2. Objects will be shifted horizontally by one pixel to create duplicates.
3. Objects will be resized to double their original size.

Using these rules, we can predict the following output:

Output: [[9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0]]

In summary, the task seems to involve applying a transformation to a grid of pixels based on certain patterns and symmetries. The specific transformation rules may vary depending on the input-output pair, but they often involve replacing objects with new objects of the same color, shifting objects horizontally, and resizing objects.
