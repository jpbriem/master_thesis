[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 9, 2, 0], [0, 9, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 9, 0, 0], [3, 9, 2, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 9, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0], [8, 2, 0, 9, 5, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8], [6, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 1, 0, 0], [6, 1, 0, 8]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 6, 0, 2, 0], [8, 0, 6, 7, 0, 3], [0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0, 7, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my response in JSON format:

{
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has no changes in pixels, as it is already fully filled with the color 3.",
"object_changes": "There are no objects in the input grid."
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has the following changes:",
"object_changes": "The input grid contains two objects: one with the color 2 and the other with the color 5."
},
"example_3_description": {
"pixel_changes": "The input grid has the following changes:",
"object_changes": "The input grid contains three objects: two with the color 1 and one with the color 6."
},
"overall_pattern": "All input-output pairs share the same underlying transformation pattern, where each pixel is either unchanged or replaced by a neighboring pixel of the same color, and objects are created or destroyed by connecting or disconnecting pixels of the same color.",
"instructions": "To transform the input grid, follow these steps:",
"test_case_input_copy": "Copy the test case input grid from the task.",
"test_case_grid_view": "Regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns.",
"test_case_object_view": "Regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number.",
"test_case_transformation": "Describe how the grid or objects should be transformed.",
"test_case_output": "Create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array."
}

Now, let me explain each part of the task in more detail:

1. Example_1: In this example, there is no transformation needed, as the input grid is already fully filled with the color 3. Therefore, the output grid should also be the same as the input grid.
2. Example_2: In this example, we need to apply the following transformation rules:
* For each pixel with the color 2, replace it with the pixel located one position to the right (i.e., shift the pixel one position to the right).
* For each pixel with the color 5, replace it with the pixel located one position up (i.e., shift the pixel one position up).
* All other pixels remain unchanged.

As a result, we get the output grid shown in the second example.

3. Example_3: In this example, we need to apply the following transformation rules:
* For each pixel with the color 1, replace it with the pixel located one position to the left (i.e., shift the pixel one position to the left).
* For each pixel with the color 6, replace it with the pixel located one position down (i.e., shift the pixel one position down).
* All other pixels remain unchanged.

As a result, we get the output grid shown in the third example.

4. Test case: To transform the input grid, we need to apply the same transformation rules as in Examples 2 and 3. Specifically, we need to shift pixels one position to the right or up if they have the color 2 or 5, respectively, and leave all other pixels unchanged. The resulting output grid should be a NumPy array with the same shape as the input grid.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional clarification.
