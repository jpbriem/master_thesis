[INST] <<SYS>>
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]] represents a pixel grid of dimension (2,5) with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,1)], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [(0,4)], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the fields.

The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 6, 3, 0, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 0, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6, 9, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
  Sure, I understand the task! Here's my response in JSON format:

{
"example_1_description": {
"pixel_changes": "No changes",
"object_changes": "No changes"
},
"example_2_description": {
"pixel_changes": "All pixels changed to 0",
"object_changes": "No objects"
},
"example_3_description": {
"pixel_changes": "Some pixels changed, some remained the same",
"object_changes": "Objects moved and resized"
},
"overall_pattern": "Inverse transformation",
"instructions": "Transform the input grid so that each object is flipped over its central vertical line, keeping its original size and orientation.",
"test_case_input_copy": "[8, 0, 0, 1, 0]",
"test_case_grid_view": "A grid with objects of various sizes and colors, with some objects touching each other",
"test_case_object_view": "Objects with different sizes and colors, some touching each other, others not",
"test_case_transformation": "Flip each object over its central vertical line, keeping its original size and orientation",
"test_case_output": "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
}

For Example 1, there are no changes to either the pixels or objects, so both descriptions would be empty. For Example 2, all pixels are set to 0, so there are no objects and no changes to the pixels. For Example 3, some pixels change while others remain the same, and objects move and resize. The overall pattern is an inverse transformation, meaning that each object is flipped over its central vertical line.

To perform the transformation, we need to copy the input grid, then iterate over each object and flip it over its central vertical line. We can keep track of the object's original size and orientation to ensure that the transformation is correct. Finally, we can create the resulting output grid as a NumPy array.
