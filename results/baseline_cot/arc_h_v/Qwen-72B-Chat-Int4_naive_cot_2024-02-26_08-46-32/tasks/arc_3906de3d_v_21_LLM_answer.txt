prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input has a set of black (0) pixels surrounding a group of eight pixels of value 8 arranged in an L-shape. There is also a group of three pixels with value 5 placed horizontally near the bottom-right corner. In the output, these five pixels have been moved upwards and to the left until they reach the L-shaped structure of 8-pixels, where they are inserted into the gaps in the shape.",
        "object_changes": "There are two main objects in the input - the L-shaped structure made of 8-pixel values and the horizontal line of 5-pixel values. After the transformation, there is still an L-shaped structure but now it contains the 5-pixel values distributed throughout the shape. This change affects both the color distribution and the positions of the pixels."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input consists of a large square of 8-pixel values surrounded by black (0) pixels. Within the square, there is another smaller square of 8-pixel values. Additionally, there are groups of three pixels each with value 5 placed vertically in the middle of the right edge of the inner square. In the output, the smaller square has expanded outwards and taken on some of the 8-pixel values from the larger square. Furthermore, the groups of 5-pixel values have been rearranged so that they form a continuous vertical column within the smaller square.",
        "object_changes": "In the input, there are two distinct objects - the larger square composed of 8-pixel values and the smaller square composed of 8-pixel values. In the output, these objects have merged together to create a new shape with a hole in the center. The columns of 5-pixel values have changed their position and orientation, affecting their shape and connectivity."

        "pixel_changes": "This example shows a grid of 8-pixel values arranged in a rectangle with four corners and a central square, separated by rows and columns of black (0) pixels. Inside the central square, there are two groups of three pixels each with value 5 placed diagonally opposite each other. In the output, the two groups of 5-pixel values have swapped places while maintaining their diagonal arrangement relative to the central square. No other changes were observed in the rest of the grid.",
        "object_changes": "The input grid contains two main objects - the outer rectangle composed of 8-pixel values and the inner square composed of 8-pixel values. These objects remain unchanged after the transformation. However, the internal configuration of the 5-pixel values has shifted, altering the connectivity and shape of those objects."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "The common thread among these examples is that they involve rearranging small groups of pixels (with value 5) within larger structures composed mainly of pixels with value 8. Specifically, the 5-pixel groups move around the grid while preserving certain relationships with respect to the larger structures. Depending on the specific example, these movements may cause mergers, splits, or reshaping of the original objects present in the input.",

    "<test_case_grid_view>": "The test input grid is a 10x10 matrix of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 8. It starts with two rows and ends with two rows of 0-value pixels. The remaining six rows contain a combination of 8 and 0-value pixels arranged in various configurations. There are two regions of interest - a diamond-like structure formed by alternating 8 and 0-value pixels, and a rectangle consisting entirely of 8-value pixels. At the intersection of these two structures, there are two groups of three 5-pixel values located diagonally opposite each other.",
    "<test_case_object_view>": "There are several objects present in the test input grid. Firstly, there is a diamond-like structure composed of alternating 8 and 0-value pixels.
