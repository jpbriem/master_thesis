prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 5], [4, 0, 6, 1, 5], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 2, 6, 1, 5]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0, 7], [0, 0, 6, 7]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 7], [2, 1, 6, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 6], [2, 9, 0, 4, 6], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 6], [2, 9, 1, 4, 6]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 4], [8, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, the input grid has several non-zero valued pixels that are changed to zero in the output grid. Specifically, any occurrence of value 2 in the input grid becomes zero in the output grid.', 'object_changes': 'There are no changes to the objects in terms of their numbers or sizes. However, there are some movements of these objects. For instance, the object with color 5 moves rightwards by two positions, while another object with color 2 shifts downwards by one position.'},
'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'This example shows that whenever an object (in this case, represented by a non-zero valued pixel) appears alone without touching other objects of the same color, then it disappears in the output grid. Also, note that all occurrences of value 0 in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.', 'object_changes': 'Only two objects exist in both the input and output grids. Their respective colors do not change, but they undergo slight movements. In particular, the object with color 7 shifts upwards by one row, while the other object with color 6 does not move'},
'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'All instances of value 2 in the input grid become zeros in the output grid. Additionally, there is a new appearance of a non-zero valued pixel in the bottom-left corner of the output grid.', 'object_changes': 'Objects of colors 4 and 6 maintain their presence in the output grid. There is also an increase in the size of the object with color 9 due to merging with the neighboring object with color 1.'},
'overall_pattern': 'The general pattern observed across the given examples suggests that all occurrences of value 2 in the input grid will disappear in the output grid. Moreover, if an object appears isolated without touching other objects of the same color, then it vanishes from the output grid. Finally, any existing object may grow in size due to merging with nearby objects.',
'instructions': 'To perform the required transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the input grid.\n2. If the current element equals 2, set it to 0.\n3. Otherwise, check if the element's neighbors belong to the same object (i.e., having the same non-zero value). If so, merge them together by updating the current element's value accordingly.\n4. Once the above process completes, return the modified grid as the output.',
'test_case_input_copy': '[[8, 0, 0, 1, 4], [8, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]',
'test_case_grid_view': 'The test input grid consists of five rows and five columns. It contains various non-zero valued pixels distributed throughout the grid, along with many instances of the value 0.',
'test_case_object_view': 'There are four distinct objects present in the test input grid. They are characterized by the following attributes:\n\n1. Color: 1; Size: 1; Coordinates: [(3, 3)]; Movement: None;\n2. Color: 2; Size: 1; Coordinates: [(3, 1)]; Movement: None;\n3. Color: 4; Size: 1; Coordinates: [(1, 4)]; Movement: None;\n4. Color: 8; Size: 2; Coordinates: [(0, 0), (1, 0)]; Movement: None;',
'test_case_transformation': 'The transformation involves removing instances of value 2 and potentially merging objects whose neighboring elements have the same non-zero value.',
'test_case_output': np.array([[8, 0, 0, 1, 4], [8, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]])}
