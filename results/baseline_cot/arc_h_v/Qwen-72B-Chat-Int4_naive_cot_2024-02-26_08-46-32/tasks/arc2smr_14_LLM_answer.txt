prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.

The difference lies in how these new colors are distributed among the original pixels with value 6. In each example, the pixels with value 6 were part of an existing object, and their replacement led to a change in the appearance of that object.",
    "<instructions>": "To apply the transformation seen in these examples, follow these steps:

1. Identify all pixels in the input grid with value 6.
2. Replace every other pixel with value 6 with the new color 5 (starting from the top left corner).
3. Leave the remaining pixels with value 6 unchanged.

Note that this transformation affects only pixels with value 6 and does not alter any other pixel values in the grid.",

    "<test_case_grid_view>": "The test input grid consists of 7 rows and 17 columns. There are several regions of black pixels (value 0), and four regions of non-zero pixels. These regions form the shapes of rectangles with dimensions 2x2, 1x2, 1x2, and 1x1 respectively. Each region contains either 6 or 0 pixels.",
    "<test_case_object_view>": "The test input grid contains four distinct objects. Three of them have color 6 and one has color 0. The objects' sizes range from 1x1 to 2x2, and their positions vary across the grid.",
    "<test_case_transformation>": "To transform the test input grid according to the observed pattern, we need to identify the pixels with value 6 and replace every other pixel with the new color 5 (while keeping the rest of the pixels unchanged). This will result in a modified grid with alternating colors 5 and 6 within the existing objects.",
    "<test_case_output>": "[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
}
```

The overall pattern of the transformation involves replacing every other pixel with value 6 with the new color 5 while leaving the remaining pixels with value 6 unchanged. To achieve this effect, simply iterate over the input grid and modify the relevant pixels accordingly.
