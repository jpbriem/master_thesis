prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 2, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [8, 3, 2, 1]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0], [2, 7, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 5, 0], [4, 1, 5, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we see that there are four changes made to the input grid. These include removing two instances of color 2 (in row 2 column 2 and row 3 column 3), moving one instance of color 2 from row 2 column 3 to row 3 column 3, and adding an instance of color 2 in row 2 column 4.', 'object_changes': 'Regarding the objects, the main change involves the redistribution of pixels belonging to object 2. One of its pixels has moved from position [row=2, col=3] to [row=3, col=3]. Another new pixel of color 2 has been added at position [row=2, col=4]. As a result, the overall shape and size of object 2 remain unchanged but the positions of some of its pixels have changed.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'There are no changes made to the input grid in this example. All pixels retain their original values.', 'object_changes': 'All objects in the input grid remain unchanged. There are no changes to their respective colors, sizes, coordinates, shapes, or numbers.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'This example shows three changes to the input grid. A new instance of color 4 is introduced in row 2 column 1, while one instance of color 4 in row 1 column 1 is removed. Also, an existing instance of color 5 in row 2 column 3 moves to row 1 column 3.', 'object_changes': 'Regarding the objects, a new object 4 is created with one pixel at position [row=2, col=1]. Meanwhile, object 5 loses a pixel at position [row=2, col=3] and gains a pixel at position [row=1, col=3]. Thus, the total number of objects remains constant.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common theme among these examples seems to involve rearranging or redistributing the pixels of certain objects without changing the total number of objects or introducing any entirely new colors. Some pixels may move between rows or columns, others may be added or removed, but the net effect results in a reconfiguration of the existing objects rather than creating new ones.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation, follow these steps:

1. Identify each object present in the input grid and note its color, size, and starting coordinates.
2. Look for specific trigger conditions that will cause a pixel to change position or value. For example, if a particular combination of neighboring pixels exists, then a rearrangement might occur.
3. Apply the rearrangement rules identified in Step 2 to modify the input grid accordingly.
4. Verify that no new colors have been introduced and that the total number of objects remains the same before and after the transformation.

Implement the above instructions using code.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 5, 0], [0, 6, 0, 3], [9, 0, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'The test input grid consists of a 4x4 matrix filled with various non-zero integers ranging from 0 to 9, inclusive.
