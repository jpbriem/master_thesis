prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 4, 8, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 0, 0, 1]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0, 1], [7, 3, 0, 1]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 1], [0, 4, 8, 0, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[3, 9, 5, 0], [3, 0, 5, 2], [3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 9, 5, 2]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, we observe that all instances of color 2 and 4 in the input grid become color 2 and 4 in the output grid respectively. However, instances of color 8 get replicated along their right side in the output grid.",
        "object_changes": "There are two distinct objects in both the input and output grids - an object colored 2 and another object colored 8. In the input grid, the 2-colored object has dimensions (2x3) and the 8-colored object has dimensions (2x2). In the output grid, these sizes remain unchanged but the 8-colored object gets repeated horizontally."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "All non-zero pixels in the input grid get duplicated along their bottom edge while keeping other positions unaltered.",
        "object_changes": "There are three objects present in the input grid - one each of colors 3, 1, and 7. These objects also appear in the output grid with no change in color. However, there's a duplication of the objects along the bottom edge. This results in additional copies of the objects having the same properties as the original ones."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "Non-zero pixels in the input grid are mirrored vertically in the output grid. Also, any zero-valued cells next to them also reflect accordingly. For instance, if a cell has value 8 in the input grid, then its mirror position will also contain 8, and the immediately neighboring cells would also mirror their respective values",
        "object_changes": "Objects in the input grid retain their identity in the output grid, i.e., they maintain the same color and shape. But due to vertical mirroring, the relative positions of these objects change."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "A common thread across all examples seems to be the replication or transformation of existing elements in the input grid to form the output grid. There doesn't seem to be any new elements introduced that weren't already present in the input grid.",
    "<instructions>": [
        "Step 1: Identify unique colors present in the input grid.",
        "Step 2: For every identified color, find the set of all its occurrences in the input grid.",
        "Step 3: Depending upon the specific transformation pattern observed in previous examples, apply the same operation to the found sets of occurrences for each color.",
