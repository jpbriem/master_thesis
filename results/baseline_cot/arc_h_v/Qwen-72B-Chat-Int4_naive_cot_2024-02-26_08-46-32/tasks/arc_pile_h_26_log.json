            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8]]\noutput: [[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[3, 0, 3, 3, 0], [8, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 9]]\noutput: [[3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n```json\n{\n    \"<example_1_description>\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"In this example, the input has several colored regions (6, 2, 9, 8, 0) while the output has simplified these regions to larger blocks of solid colors.

Additionally, smaller clusters have disappeared completely\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"The number of objects decreased because some objects got merged together\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"The overall pattern seems to merge smaller clusters of colors into bigger ones. In other words, the transformation combines adjacent cells of the same value to form larger continuous areas of that value.\",\n    \"instructions\": \"To perform the transformation, start scanning through the input grid row-by-row. For each cell, if it matches the value of the previous cell in the same row, then move to the next cell without changing anything. If it does not match, check if any of the four neighbors (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) have the same value. If so, merge the current cell with its neighbor having the matching value. Otherwise, keep the original value of the cell. Repeat until all cells have been processed.\",\n    \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[[0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]\",\n    \"test_case_grid_view\": \"The test input consists of five rows and five columns.

Another object is located in the last row and fifth column.\",\n    \"test_case_transformation\": \"Starting from the leftmost cell of the top row, we see that the value is 0 and there is no previous cell in the same row. So we keep the value as 0 and move to the next cell. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the row. Next, we move to the second row and repeat the process. When we encounter a cell with value 3, we compare it with the previous cell in the same row which has value 0. Since they do not match, we look at the neighboring cells and find that the bottom-right cell has value 0. Therefore, we merge the current cell with its neighbor and assign the value 0 to both cells. We continue this process until all cells have been processed.\",\n    \"test_case_output\": \"[[0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]]\"\n}\n```\n\nI hope this helps!
