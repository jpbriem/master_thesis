prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 9], [0, 0, 6, 3, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 4], [0, 5, 8, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 5, 0, 0], [7, 5, 8, 4]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 0, 0, 8, 3], [0, 2, 4, 8, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]

Sample Outputs:

This transformation affects both the pixel layout and the object composition of the grid.', 'instructions': 'To perform the transformation, follow these steps:

1. Identify the non-background pixels in the input grid.
2. Shift each non-background pixel according to its value, using the following rules:
   - Pixel values 3 and 7 do not change their positions.
   - Pixel values 2 and 6 shift one position to the right.
   - Pixel values 4 and 8 shift one position downwards.
   - Pixel values 5 and 9 shift one position diagonally towards the lower-right corner.
3. Merge any overlapping objects caused by the shifts.
4. Remove any objects that have been completely absorbed by others.
5. Add any new objects formed due to the shifts.
6. Update the final output grid with the modified objects.

Note: These instructions may not perfectly generalize to all possible inputs, but they should work for the given examples.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[1, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 6], [0, 0, 4, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'The test input grid consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. There are five distinct regions of non-zero values:
Region 1: Top row, second column (color: 1)
Region 2: Third row, third column (color: 7)
Region 3: Fourth row, fourth column (color: 4)
Region 4: Fourth row, second column (color: 4)
Region 5: Third row, fourth column (color: 6)

Overall, the grid has an irregular distribution of colored pixels.', 'test_case_object_view': 'There are three objects present in the test input grid:
Object_1: Color: 1, Coordinates: [[0, 1]], Size: 1
Object_2: Color: 7, Coordinates: [[2, 2]], Size: 1

These objects form a disconnected configuration, where Object_1 and Object_2 touch along their shared border.', 'test_case_transformation': 'According to the overall pattern, we need to shift the non-background pixels in the test input grid as follows:
- Object_1 (color: 1): No shift
- Object_2 (color: 7): Shift one position to the left
- Object_3 (color: 4): Shift one position downward

After applying these shifts, we obtain the following updated objects:
New Object_1 (merged from Object_2 and Object_1): Color: 7, Coordinates: [[1, 2]], Size: 1
New Object_2 (merged from Object_3 and Object_2): Color: 4, Coordinates: [[2, 3], [2, 2]], Size: 2

Finally, update the output grid with these modified objects:', 'test_case_output': np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 4, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0]])}
