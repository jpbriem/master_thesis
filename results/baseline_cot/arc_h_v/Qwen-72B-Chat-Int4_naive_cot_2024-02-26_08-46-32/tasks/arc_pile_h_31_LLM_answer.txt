prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0]]
output: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [9, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 9, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]
output: [[9, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 9, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, each row of the input grid has been replaced by the maximum value present in that row. For instance, in the first row, the maximum value is 8, so the whole row becomes 8. Similarly, other rows follow the same rule.', 'object_changes': 'There are no distinct objects in the input grid. However, after applying the transformation, there are six new objects in the output grid. These objects represent the unique maximum values (i.e., 8, 5, 1) found in each row of the input grid.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, the transformation applied to each column is such that the minimum value in that column replaces every non-zero element in that column. For example, in the second column, the minimum value is 0, so the whole column becomes 0. This applies to all columns except the last column where the original values remain unchanged.', 'object_changes': 'No objects exist in the input grid. After applying the transformation, there are four new objects in the output grid. These objects correspond to the unique minimum values (i.e., 0, 1, 8, 9) found in each modified column of the input grid.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'This example shows an identity transformation. Each row of the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.', 'object_changes': 'No changes occur in terms of objects since the input grid already contains distinct objects (i.e., 6, 9, 1). In the output grid, these objects retain their original positions, sizes, and shapes.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common transformation across all input-output pairs appears to involve replacing either rows or columns with a specific value derived from those rows or columns. This process creates new objects while preserving existing ones.', 'instructions': 'To perform the transformation, we need to iterate through each row or column of the input grid and identify a specific value to replace the elements in that row or column.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [0, 9, 9, 0, 9], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'The test input grid consists of five rows and five columns. There are multiple colored regions within the grid:', 'test_case_object_view': 'There are three objects in the test input grid:', 'test_case_transformation': 'We will apply a row-based transformation similar to the one used in Example 1. Specifically, for each row, we will find the maximum value present in that row and then replace all non-zero elements in that row with that maximum value.', 'test_case_output': np.array([[6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [9, 9, 9, 0, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]])}
