prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 1, 8, 4, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 4, 0, 7], [0, 4, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 4, 3, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 7], [0, 4, 0, 7], [0, 4, 3, 7]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 2, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 2, 5], [0, 0, 2, 5]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1], [0, 7, 6, 0, 3, 0], [0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, there are no new pixels added to the output grid compared to the input grid. However, some existing pixels change their positions or merge with other pixels.",
        "object_changes": "There are two main types of changes in the objects between the input and output grids. First, some objects shrink or disappear completely due to merging with other objects or losing their edges. Second, some objects grow by absorbing neighboring pixels."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows that all pixels remain in the output grid but they rearrange themselves to form a new pattern. Specifically, each row of the output grid has fewer non-zero elements than the corresponding row of the input grid.",
        "object_changes": "All objects remain in the output grid but they become smaller because some of their constituent pixels move to the right side of the grid."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, we observe an expansion of the existing objects. Some previously empty cells get filled with pixels while others remain unchanged.",
        "object_changes": "All objects expand in both dimensions (width and height) by incorporating more pixels from the surrounding area. In particular, the second and fourth columns of the input grid contribute most to the growth of the objects."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "Based on these three examples, we can identify the following common pattern: Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a region in the input grid where the pixels are shifted either horizontally or vertically depending on the position of the cell relative to the original image. More specifically, if a cell in the output grid has coordinate (i,j), then its corresponding region in the input grid consists of all cells with coordinates (x,y) such that x-i and y-j are even numbers. This shifting operation results in a diagonal displacement of the pixels within each object towards the top-right corner of the grid.",
    "<instructions>": [
        "For each cell in the output grid, determine its corresponding region in the input grid using the formula above.",
        "Identify the set of pixels belonging to each object in the input grid.",
        "Shift each identified object according to its corresponding region in the input grid.",
        "Assign the shifted pixels to the appropriate cells in the output grid.",
        "Fill any remaining empty cells in the output grid with zeros."

    "<test_case_input_copy>": "[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1], [0, 7, 6, 0, 3, 0], [0, 7, 0, 2, 0, 0]]",
    "<test_case_grid_view>": "The input grid contains six rows and six columns of pixels. There are several objects in the grid, including a large rectangle of blue pixels (color=8) in the upper left corner, a small green square (color=2) in the lower right corner, and various combinations of red, yellow, and purple pixels scattered throughout the rest of the grid.",
    "<test_case_object_view>": "There are four distinct objects in the input grid: Object_1 (blue, size=16, coordinates=[[0,0], ..., [5,5]]), Object_2 (green, size=4, coordinates=[[4,3], [4,4], [5,3], [5,4]]),
