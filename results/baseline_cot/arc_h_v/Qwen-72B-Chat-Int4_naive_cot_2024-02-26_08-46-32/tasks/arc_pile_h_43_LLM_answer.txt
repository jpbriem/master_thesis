prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0]]
output: [[8, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 4, 4, 4], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[4, 4, 4, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we observe that the bottom-right corner of each object has been replaced by the second-to-bottom and second-to-right pixel of the original object.', 'object_changes': 'There is no change in the number of objects present. However, there is a decrease in size of both objects. Object_1 (color: '3') reduces in size from 3x1 to 2x1, while Object_2 (color: '2') reduces in size from 1x1 to 0x1. Their coordinates also shift accordingly.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'All instances of color '7' in the top row have shifted one position downwards, replacing the existing instances of color '0'.

Object_2 (color: '4') decreases in size from 3x1 to 2x1 due to the swapping of columns. Its coordinates also shift accordingly. Object_3 (color: '5') increases in size from 2x1 to 3x1 due to the swapping of columns.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common thread among all examples seems to involve shifting or rearranging certain parts of the input grid to create the desired output. In some cases, specific corners or edges of an object may need to be adjusted, whereas in others, entire rows or columns may require reorganization.', 'instructions': 'To perform the necessary transformation, follow these steps:

1. Identify the region(s) of the grid that will be affected by the transformation. This could include specific corners or edges of objects, or even whole rows or columns.
2. Shift or rearrange the identified regions according to the pattern seen in the given examples. Be mindful of any changes in object sizes, positions, or overall structure.
3. Ensure that the transformed grid adheres to the constraints mentioned in the prompt, such as maintaining the same number of objects and respecting the boundaries between them.

By applying these instructions consistently across various input grids, you should be able to produce the expected outputs.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'Regarding the test input grid, we have four distinct regions:
Region 1 (top-left): contains a single instance of color '9'
Region 2 (top-center): consists of three consecutive instances of color '6'
Region 3 (bottom-center): features two instances of color '5' separated by a single instance of color '0'
Region 4 (bottom-right): comprises three instances of color '3'

These regions form a unique arrangement of colors within the grid.', 'test_case_object_view': 'Based on the test input grid, we can identify the following objects:
Object_1: {color: '9', coordinates: [[0,0]], size: 1}

Object_3: {color: '5', coordinates: [[2,2], [2,3]], size: 2}

These objects occupy specific areas within the grid and exhibit varying sizes and positions.', 'test_case_transformation': 'For the test case, we need to apply the following transformation steps:

1. Replace the top-right corner of Object_2 (color: '6') with the second-to-top and second-to-right pixel of Object_2. As a result, the new coordinates become [[1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4]]. Size increases to 4x1.
2. Move the third column of Region 1 to the left so that it becomes part of Region 2. The updated grid should now contain two instances of color '9' in the top row.
3. Swap Regions 3 and 4 so that they maintain their relative positions but switch places. The final grid should have color '3' in the top-center and color '5' in the bottom-right.', 'test_case_output': np.array([[9, 0, 0, 0], [9, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5]])}
