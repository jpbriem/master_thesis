            "prompt_log": "Sample Prompt:\nYou are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. \nExample: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.\n\nThe logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:\n- Geometry and topology:\n\t- Lines, rectangular shapes.\n\t- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.\n \t- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.\n\t- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.\n\t- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.\n\t- Copying, repeating.\n\t- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.\n- Objects:\n\t- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.\n\t- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.\n\t- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.\n\t- Noise pixels.\n-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:\n\t- Counting.\n\t- Sorting.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.\n\n\nYou are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.\nYou are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or \" within the json fields.\n\n\nThe following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.\nExample_1:\ninput: [[1, 0, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 0, 4, 7, 5, 9], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9], [1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 7, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 9], [1, 0, 4, 7, 5, 9], [1, 6, 4, 7, 5, 9]]\n\nExample_2:\ninput: [[0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 6, 7]]\n\nExample_3:\ninput: [[6, 0, 5, 7, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 4], [6, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 9, 5, 7, 4]]\noutput: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 7, 4], [6, 0, 5, 7, 4], [6, 9, 5, 7, 4]]\n\n\n\nTest case:\ninput: [[9, 8, 1, 0], [9, 8, 0, 7], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 8, 1, 7]]\n\n###########################################################\nSample Outputs:\n```json\n{\n    \"<example_1_description>\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"All non-zero pixels in the input grid that are surrounded by other non-zero pixels are replaced with zeros.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Objects of color 4 and 7 shrink towards their center (coordinates [2,2]).\"\n    },\n    \"<example_2_description>\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"All non-zero pixels in the input grid are replaced with zeros except those located in the bottom right corner.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Objects of color 5 and 6 expand to cover the entire bottom row.\"\n    },\n    \"<example_3_description>\": {\n        \"pixel_changes\": \"All non-zero pixels in the input grid that are surrounded by other non-zero pixels are replaced with zeros.\",\n        \"object_changes\": \"Objects of color 1 and 7 move one position upwards and leftwards respectively.\"\n    },\n    \"overall_pattern\": \"The transformation replaces all non-zero pixels in the input grid with zeros except for certain regions where they remain unchanged or undergo specific changes.\",\n    \"instructions\": [\n        \"For each row i in the input grid:\",\n        \"  For each column j in the input grid:\",\n            \"- If the current cell has a value of zero, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to zero.\",\n            \"- Otherwise, if there exists an object O in the input grid such that the current cell is part of O's boundary and O does not intersect any other objects in the input grid, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to zero.\",\n            \"- Otherwise, copy the value of the current cell to the corresponding cell in the output grid.\"\n    ],\n    \"test_case_input_copy\": \"[[9, 8, 1, 0], [9, 8, 0, 7], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 8, 1, 7]]\",\n    \"test_case_grid_view\": \"There are four distinct colored cells in this grid: two cells of color 9, two cells of color 8, two cells of color 1, and three cells of color 7.
