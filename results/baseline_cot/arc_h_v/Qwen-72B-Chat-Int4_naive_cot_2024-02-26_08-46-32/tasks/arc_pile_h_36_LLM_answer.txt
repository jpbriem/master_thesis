prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [3, 3, 0, 3, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [9, 9, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[7, 0, 7, 7], [5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[7, 7, 7, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 3, 3, 0, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 7, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4], [0, 6, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The input grid has been copied and pasted to the right side of the grid, but shifted down by one row. Also, each instance of the digit 6 was replaced by three instances of that digit.', 'object_changes': 'No new objects were created, but existing ones changed their sizes. Specifically, the object with color 6 increased its size by two pixels (from one to three). Similarly, the object with color 3 grew horizontally by three pixels (from two to five) while maintaining the same height. Lastly, the object with color 9 remained unchanged.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'All digits in the input grid were shifted one column to the left, except for the digit 0, which did not move. Additionally, every occurrence of the digit 0 was replaced by the adjacent non-zero digit to its top-left corner. For example, where there used to be a 0, now there is a 7, an 8, or a 4 depending on the context.', 'object_changes': 'In this process, no new objects were formed. However, some objects merged together due to the shifting of digits. Specifically, the original objects of colors 7, 5, and 8 combined into a larger object with the same color 7. Furthermore, the objects of colors 4 and 6 also joined forces, forming a bigger object with color 4.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'Each row in the input grid was duplicated below itself, with the exception of the last row. Moreover, whenever there was a non-zero digit, it would be repeated thrice horizontally across the corresponding row.', 'object_changes': 'This operation resulted in no creation of new objects. Instead, the existing objects expanded both vertically and horizontally. For example, the object with color 2 doubled its vertical extent, whereas the object with color 4 tripled its horizontal span. The object with color 3 maintained its vertical size but grew horizontally by two pixels.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common thread among these input-output pairs is the replication and expansion of pre-existing objects through various means such as duplication, stretching, shifting, and merging.', 'instructions': 'To achieve the desired transformation, follow these steps:

1. Duplicate each row in the input grid beneath itself, except for the last row.
2. Shift all rows downward by one position, effectively creating a gap at the top of the grid.
3. Replace every instance of the digit 0 in the bottom half of the grid with the nearest non-zero digit found above it, moving from left to right until a non-zero value is encountered.
4. Finally, repeat any non-zero digit present in the bottom half of the grid horizontally thrice across its respective row.

By applying these instructions, the input grid will undergo a transformation consistent with the observed examples.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 7, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 4], [0, 6, 0, 0]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'A 4x4 grid consisting of four distinct objects: Object_1 (color 1), Object_2 (color 7), Object_3 (color 4), and Object_4 (color 6).

1. Duplicate the second row and insert it between the first and third rows.
2. Shift the newly inserted row one position to the left.
