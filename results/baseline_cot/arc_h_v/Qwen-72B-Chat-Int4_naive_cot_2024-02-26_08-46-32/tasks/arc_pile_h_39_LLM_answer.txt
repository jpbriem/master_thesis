prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 5, 0]]
output: [[4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]]
output: [[2, 2, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6]]
output: [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 0, 0, 8, 8], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 9, 9, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]

    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, each distinct color (4, 2, 6, 1, 5) from the input has been moved to the leftmost column in the output. All other positions are filled with zeros.",
        "object_changes": "All objects remain the same except their sizes shrink to 1x1 because they move to the leftmost position."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows that if there's an isolated colored pixel in the input, it will become two rows of that color in the output. Otherwise, if there's a pair of horizontally connected pixels of the same color, these two pixels will form a row of that color in the output. Other positions are filled with zeros.",
        "object_changes": "There're no changes in terms of object numbers but some objects' sizes increase due to merging multiple disconnected components into a larger one."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "Similar to example 1, every non-zero value in the input is shifted to the top-left corner in the output while preserving the order from left to right. Zeros fill the remaining space.",
        "object_changes": "Objects maintain their original colors but reduce in size to 1x1 since they move towards the top-left corner."
    },
    "<overall_pattern>": "The common pattern among these examples involves shifting unique colors present in the input towards the top-left corner while preserving their relative order. Non-shifted areas are filled with zeros. This transformation results in a reduced size for existing objects.",

        "Identify all unique colors present in the input grid.",

Color 8 occupies two columns in the first row; color 2 appears once in the second row, and color 9 takes over two columns in the third row. The remaining spaces are filled with zeros.",
