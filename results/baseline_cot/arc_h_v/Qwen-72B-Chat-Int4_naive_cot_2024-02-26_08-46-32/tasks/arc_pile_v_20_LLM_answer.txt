prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[7, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9], [0, 0, 2, 9], [7, 0, 2, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 2, 0, 0, 4], [8, 0, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4], [8, 2, 0, 9, 4]]



Test case:
input: [[7, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we observe that the input grid has some non-zero elements (7, 0, 0, 9) in the corners while the rest of the elements are either 0 or 2. In the output grid, these corner elements remain unchanged, but there's a change in the interior. Specifically, the input element value 2 gets replaced with 0 if surrounded by other 2s, otherwise it remains the same.', 'object_changes': 'There are no explicit objects mentioned here, so we will focus on changes regarding the overall structure. There is a reduction in the number of elements having the value 2 in the interior of the grid. Also, an additional element with the value 7 appears in the bottom-right corner of the output grid.'}, 'example_2_description': {'pixel_changes': 'This example shows a repeated pattern of four 4s arranged in a square configuration in the input grid. However, in the output grid, this pattern is simplified such that the two central cells maintain their original values while the outer cells become zeros.', 'object_changes': 'As in the previous example, we do not discuss specific objects here. We note that the size of the structure represented by the value 4 decreases in the output grid.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The input grid contains several non-zero elements distributed throughout the rows and columns. In the output grid, most of the interior cells with the value 0 are filled with the respective surrounding elements (e.g., 8, 2, 9). Additionally, the bottom-left cell with the value 4 disappears altogether.', 'object_changes': 'We don't explicitly talk about objects in this example. However, we see that certain structures represented by non-zero values expand or contract depending on the surrounding context.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'The common thread among all the input-output pairs seems to involve simplifying complex configurations in the input grid by replacing certain elements with 0 or filling them with surrounding elements. This process leads to more uniform or expanded structures in the output grid.', 'instructions': 'To perform the desired transformation, follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each row and column in the input grid.
2. For any given cell, check its neighbors' values.
3. If the current cell has a value greater than 0 and all its neighbors have the same value, set the current cell to 0.
4. Otherwise, update the current cell with the maximum value among its neighbors (excluding itself).
5. Perform these operations until the entire grid is processed.
6. Add the remaining elements from the input grid that were not modified during the above processing steps.

By applying these instructions, we obtain the expected output grid.', 'test_case_input_copy': '[[7, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]]', 'test_case_grid_view': 'Regarding the test input, we notice a variety of non-zero values scattered across the grid. These include elements like 7, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Some regions exhibit regular patterns, such as the presence of multiple 4s in the second row.', 'test_case_object_view': 'No explicit objects are defined in the test input grid. Instead, we identify various sub-regions characterized by distinct values and arrangements.', 'test_case_transformation': 'For the test input, we need to apply the previously described transformation method, which involves updating cells according to their neighboring values.', 'test_case_output': np.array([[0, 0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [7, 4, 2, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 4, 0, 5, 6]])}
