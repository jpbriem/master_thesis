prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [1, 6, 3, 0, 2]]

Example_2:
input: [[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0]]

Example_3:
input: [[0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 6, 0, 3]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6, 9, 3]]



Test case:
input: [[8, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 7, 0, 0], [8, 0, 7, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
{'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'In this example, we see that some pixels have been removed while others remain unchanged. Specifically, the top-left corner has become more open, and there seems to be an emphasis on keeping certain colors (such as 3, 6, and 2) connected.', 'object_changes': 'There is no change in the total number of objects but their sizes and positions have changed. Object_1 (color: 3), previously located at [(0, 4)], now spans across [(0, 4), (1, 4)]. Object_2 (color: 6), initially found at [(2, 2)], has moved to [(2, 4)] without any change in size.

Additionally, the two objects present in the input merge together in the output.', 'object_changes': 'There is a reduction in the number of objects; originally two separate objects (one in each row) were merged into a single object covering both rows. This results in a larger object spanning columns 1 through 4.'}, 'example_3_description': {'pixel_changes': 'The overall effect of the transformation appears to preserve the connectivity of specific colored regions, moving them closer together and filling gaps in between.', 'object_changes': 'No new objects are created, but existing ones undergo changes in size and position. For instance, Object_1 (color: 5) moves downward and expands horizontally to include column 5. Similarly, Object_2 (color: 6) shifts rightward and merges with another region to form a continuous block.'}, 'overall_pattern': 'A consistent pattern emerges across these input-output pairs where the goal is to simplify the image by merging and shifting objects toward the bottom part of the grid. In doing so, gaps between objects are filled and colors tend to cluster together.', 'instructions': 'To perform the transformation, follow these steps:

1. Identify all distinct non-zero colors in the input grid.
2. Sort the colors in ascending order.
3. Iterate over each row from top to bottom.
   - If a row contains at least one non-zero element, iterate over each column from left to right.
     - Find the smallest non-zero color value in the current row and column.
       - Replace all occurrences of smaller color values with the next higher color value until reaching the maximum among the remaining colors.
       - Move to the next column.
     - Shift all cells to the right by one position, effectively pushing the row's content downward.
     - Insert a row consisting solely of zeros at the beginning of the grid.
   - Otherwise, if the row contains only zeros, leave it unchanged.
4.
