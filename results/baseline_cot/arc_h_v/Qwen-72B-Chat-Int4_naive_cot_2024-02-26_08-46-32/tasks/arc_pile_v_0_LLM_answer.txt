prompt_log: Sample Prompt:
You are confronted with a task in which a 2-dimensional input grid of pixels should be transformed into a corresponding output grid. The input and output grids have values from 1 to 9 representing different pixel colors, and 0 representing the background color. The transformation can relate to the entire grid or individual objects in the grid. Objects are usually adjacent pixels of a single color. 
Example: [[0, 2, 2, 0, 3], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2]] represents a pixel grid of dimension [2,5] with the following objects: [Object_1: {color: '2', coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], size: 3}, Object_2: {color: '3', coordinates: [[0,4]], size: 1}, Object_3: {color: '2', coordinates: [[1,4]], size: 1}], with zero-indexing for the coordinates.

The logical pattern might refer to concepts as follows:
- Geometry and topology:
	- Lines, rectangular shapes.
	- Connecting points, orthogonal projections.
 	- Symmetries, mirroring, rotations, translations.
	- Shape upscaling or downscaling, elastic distortions.
	- Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter.
	- Copying, repeating.
	- Patterns or mosaic based on sections.
- Objects:
	- Objects are shapes based on similar colors or based on surroundings.
	- Object transformations based on geometry and topology.
	- Touching objects have at least one adjacent pixel.
	- Noise pixels.
-  Arithmetics based on objects or shapes:
	- Counting.
	- Sorting.

The list is not exhaustive. Transformations can be conditional.


You are to infer the relation between input and output. Then, your task is to transform the test input grid into its test output grid.
You are to output only the following in json format: {'example_1_description': {'pixel_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on pattern changes', 'object_changes': 'regarding the first example, describe the changes between the input and output objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates, shape, and object number'}, 'example_2_description': {Ellipsis}, 'overall_pattern': 'describe the input-output relationship valid for all input-output pairs', 'instructions': 'describe the required transformation actions in detail step by step', 'test_case_input_copy': 'copy the test case input grid from the task', 'test_case_grid_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the pixels of the entire grid, focusing on patterns', 'test_case_object_view': 'regarding the test input, describe the objects, focusing on color, size, coordinates and movement, shape, and object number', 'test_case_transformation': 'describe how the grid or objects should be transformed', 'test_case_output': 'create the resulting output grid as numpy array.'}. Any output key containing < and > indicates you must generate the key name to replace it. Example input: {'<location>': 'description of location'}, Example output: {school: a place for education}. Do not use quotation marks ' or " within the json fields.


The following input-output pairs are examples and share the same underlying transformation pattern.
Example_1:
input: [[5, 2, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 2, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 9], [0, 2, 0, 9], [5, 2, 3, 9]]

Example_2:
input: [[3, 0, 0, 2], [0, 5, 0, 2], [3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 2], [3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 5, 1, 2]]

Example_3:
input: [[5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0], [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]]
output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0], [5, 0, 8, 0, 4, 1]]



Test case:
input: [[0, 3, 0, 2], [0, 3, 8, 2], [0, 0, 8, 2], [6, 0, 8, 0]]

Sample Outputs:
```json
{
    "<example_1_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid has four non-zero-color regions (objects) that are transformed into three such regions in the output grid. Specifically, two regions merge into one region. In terms of pixel changes, some pixels change their color to 0, while others do not.",
        "object_changes": "Regarding the objects, there are initially four objects present in the input grid. After applying the transformation, we end up with only three objects in the output grid. One of the objects disappears due to merging with another object."
    },
    "<example_2_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "This example shows an input grid consisting of four non-zero-color regions (objects), which remain unchanged in the output grid except for additional zeros around them. This means that the overall structure of the objects remains intact, but they get surrounded by more background pixels.",
        "object_changes": "There are four objects present in both the input and output grids. No new objects appear or disappear; however, each existing object gains additional background pixels surrounding it."
    },
    "<example_3_description>": {
        "pixel_changes": "In this example, the input grid contains six non-zero-color regions (objects). The output grid still consists of these six regions, but their locations have changed. Some regions move vertically or horizontally, and some regions split into smaller ones or merge with other regions.",
        "object_changes": "The initial six objects undergo various changes during the transformation process. Some objects move, some split into multiple parts, and some merge with other objects. Overall, the final output grid also has six objects, but with modified sizes, positions, and structures."
    },
    "overall_pattern": "The common theme among these examples is that the transformation affects the positioning and connectivity of the non-zero-color regions (objects) in the grid. Depending on the specific example, the transformation may involve merging, splitting, moving, or adding/removing background pixels around the objects.",
    "instructions": [
        "Identify the non-zero-color regions (objects) in the input grid",
        "Analyze the transformation pattern applicable to the given example(s)",

    "<test_case_grid_view>": "The test input grid has dimensions 4x4 and consists of four non-zero-color regions (objects): two regions of color 3, one region of color 2, and one region of color 8. These regions are interconnected through shared borders. The remaining areas of the grid contain background pixels with value 0.",
    "<test_case_object_view>": "There are four objects in the test input grid: Object_1 (color 3, size 7), Object_2 (color 2, size 4), Object_3 (color 8, size 4), and Object_4 (color 6, size 4). They touch along their edges.",
    "<test_case_transformation>": "To create the output grid, apply the transformation pattern observed in the previous examples. For instance, in Example_1, merging two touching regions of the same color would result in a reduced number of objects. However, since no clear pattern emerges from the provided examples, it's difficult to determine the exact transformation rules.",
